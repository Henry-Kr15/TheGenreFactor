LYRICS:
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now time for me is nothin', 'cause I'm countin' no age
Now I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare

Intangible (ah y'all), bet you didn't think
So I command you to, panoramic view (you)
Look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kicking tunes?

Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional? Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual hero who appears on you to clear your view
When you're too crazy

Lifeless to those the definition for what life is
Priceless to you because I put you on the hype shift
Did you like it? Gut smokin' righteous with one toke
You're psychic among knows possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future (that's right) is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

The essence, the basics without did you make it?
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't
That's a fallacy, I'm in them
Every sprouting tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes

I see destruction and demise
Corruption in the skies (that's right)
From this fucking enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides

For me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind, that's the inner (fuck 'em)
So I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor

Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feeling sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, my future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, my future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on

My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future

Cracker Island

On cracker Island it was born
To the collective of the dawn
They were planting seeds at night

To grow a made up paradise
Where the truth was auto tuned (forever cult)
But it’s sadness I consumed (forever cult)
Into my formats everyday (forever cult) 
in end I had to pay (what world is this)
In the end I had to pay (I purged my soul)
In the end I had to pay (I drank to riot) 
Nothing more to say (I drank to riot)
 
They taught themselves to be occult
They didn’t know it’s many strategies x 2 
Fantasies 

What world is this? x2

On cracker island it was raised
By the collective from the grave
It only came out at night 
It ate up their paradise (paradise)
Where the truth was auto tuned (forever cult)
And it’s sadness I consumed (forever cult)
Into my formats everyday (forever cult)
In the end I had to pay (what world is this)
Out there on my silverlake (I was not there)
In the end it will be great (beneath the hills)
I’m like a ship between the tides (I saw myself)
I held on I survived (there in the void)

They taught themselves to be occult
They didn’t know it’s many strategies x2
Fantasy

On cracker island It will die (forever cult)
Join the collective in the sky (forever cult)
And on a shining boat of light (forever cult)

Go up to paradise (what world is this) 
Where the truth is autotuned (I purged my soul)
And it’s sadness I consume (I drank to riot)
Into my formats everyday (I drank to riot)
In the end I had to pay (forever cult)

In the end I’ll have to pay (forever cult)
In the end I’ll be ok (forever cult)

Nothing more to say x3

Lyrics: 
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
An' little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the east at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
Firstborn unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean no vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test but this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Lyrics: 
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like My only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city, she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Love me, I say, yeah yeah
One time

(Under the bridge downtown)
Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown)
Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away, yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh, no, no no no, yeah yeah
Oh no, I said oh, yeah yeah

Lyrics:
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to 
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

White heat is screamin' in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers 
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

This chapter's gonna be a close one
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one
All on a spaceship, persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute, I'm passin' out
Win or lose, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need
Somebody new, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
Right on cue

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but boy, you better come to
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do 
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through

Lyrics: 
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Ah, fallin' all
Over myself
To lick your heart
And taste your health, 'cause

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Blood loss in a bathroom stall
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
I wave good-bye to Ma and Pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet we
Call it fall
I'll make it to the moon
If I have to crawl and

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Lyrics: 
How long, how long
Will I slide?
Well separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
Slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up
And brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back

I gotta take it on the otherside

Well centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
The stranger things that never change my mind

I gotta take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long, how long
Will I slide?
A-separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full
And I’m spillin' my guts
She want to know
Am I still a slut?

I gotta take it on the otherside

A scarlet starlet and she’s in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Mmm-push the trigger
And I pull the thread

I gotta to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

[Chorus]
How long, how long
Will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

Turn me on
Take me for a hard ride
Burn me out
Leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that it’s not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down
And then it’s born again

How long, how long
Will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever had

(How long)
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s sad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

Lyrics: 
Come to decide that the things that I tried were in my life just to get high on. 
When I sit alone, come get a little known 
But I need more than myself this time. 
Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do believe that we rely on 
When I lay it on, come get to play it on 
All my life to sacrifice. 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
I got your hey oh, now listen what I say oh 

When will I know that I really can't go 
To the well once more - time to decide on. 
Well it's killing me, when will I really see, all that I need to look inside. 
Come to belive that I better not leave before I get my chance to ride, 
Well it's killing me, what do I really need - all that I need to look inside. 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
Come back and hey oh, look at what I say oh 

The more I see the less I know 
The more I like to let it go - hey oh, woah... 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow, 
Finally divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go; 
Inbetween the cover of another perfect wonder and it's so white as snow, 
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

Ho! 
Went to descend to ammend for a friend of the channels that had broken down. 
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up - just to hear you sing it out. 
Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do belive what we rely on, 
When I lay it on, come get to play it on 
All my life to sacrifice 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
I got your hey oh... listen what I say oh 

The more I see, the less I know 
The more I like to let it go - hey oh, woah... 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow. 
Finally divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go 
Inbetween the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow 
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

I said hey hey yeah oh yeah, tell my love now. 
Hey hey yeah oh yeah, tell my love now. 

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow, 
Finaly divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go. 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow...
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

I said hey oh yeah oh yeah... tell my love now 
Hey yeah yeah... oh yeah.

Lyrics: 
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper and mama was a hippie
In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you pick the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world? What does your company take me for?

Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
Oh her merry way sayin' baby whatcha gonna
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal forty five
Just another way to survive

[Chorus:]
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

She's a lover baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen her coming when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

[Chorus]

Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say good bye to you
Too true to say say say...

Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota

Down in the badlands she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast...

Lyrics:
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, overload

Steak knife, card shark
Con job, boot cut
Skin that flick, she's such a little DJ
To get there quick by street but not the freeway
Turn that trick to make a little leeway
Beat that nic, but not the way that we play
Dogtown, blood bath
Rib cage, soft tail

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Black jack,dope dick
Pawn shop, quick pick
Kiss that dyke, I know you want to hold one
Not on strike but I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic, I know you never stole one
Girls that like a story, so I told one
Song bird, main line
Cash back, hard top

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it

Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I know you from before

Standing in line to see the show tonight

Lyrics: 
Oh, oh

What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me, say, ""Hell, yes""
Low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now
Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Oh, oh yeah
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

Lucky me swimming in my ability
Dancing down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
My mom, I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me
Ah, there's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is a never gonna wither
Come on, everybody, time to deliver

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you

Lyrics: 
Comin' on to the light of day, we got
Many moons that are deep at play so I
Keep an eye on the shadow smile to see what it has to say
You and I both know, everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?
Spinnin' knot that is on my heart is like a
Bit of light in a touch of dark, you got
Sneak attack from the zodiacbut I see your fire spark
Eat the breeze and go,blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah

You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design and
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Stumble down to the parking lot, you got
No time for the afterthought, they're like
Ice Cream for an Astronaut,well, that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and find the world at your command
Playin' the hand, yeah

You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Do you want this love of mine? Darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it all the time? But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?

Ah, pick you up like a paperback with the
Track record of a maniac so I
Move it in and we unpack, it's the same as yesterday
Any way we roll, everything must go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah

You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky and
Dark necessities are part of my design

Ah-ah-ah

Lyrics: 
As I was going over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said stand and deliver or the devil, he may take you
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she would love me, no never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Taking money with me but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels, yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah-ah, whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah

Now some men like the fishing and some men like the fowling
And some men like to hear, to hear cannon ball a roaring
Me? I like sleeping specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da, yeah, yeah

Lyrics: 
New blood joins this Earth and quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in this whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on
He's known, ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""

They dedicate their lives to running all of his
He tries to please them all this bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
That old man here is me, yeah

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown

Won't see what might have been

You labeled me, I'll label you
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""

Anticipation
In domination 
A sea of hearts beat as one, unified
Magnification
All generations
Approaching thunder awaiting the light

Full speed or nothing 
Full speed or nothing 

Lux Æterna 
Lux Æterna 

Exhilaration
Frenzied sensation 
Kindred alliance connected inside
Commiseration
Sonic salvation
Cast out the demons that strangle your life

Full speed or nothing
Full speed or nothing 

Lux Æterna 
Lux Æterna 

Lux Æterna

Emancipation 
Kill isolation
Never alone for the feelings alike 
Amplification 
Lightning the nation
Never alive more
Than right here tonight

Full speed or nothing
Full speed or nothing 

Lux Æterna 
Lux Æterna 

Light it

“‘Screaming Suicide’ addresses the taboo word of suicide. The intention is to communicate about the darkness we feel inside. It's ridiculous to think we should deny that we have these thoughts. At one point or another, I believe most people have thought about it. To face it is to speak the unspoken. If it's a human experience, we should be able to talk about it. You are not alone.”

LYRICS

Welcome to this life
Born into the fight
Here to claim your dream
Look you in the eye
Patch the broken sky
Craving dopamine
Then my voice appears
Teaching you of fears
Are you good enough?
You don’t recognize
Head is full of lies
You should just give up
 
Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well
 
Don’t ever speak my name
Remember you’re to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide
 
Curse another day
Spirit locked away
Punish and deprive
Hate to be awake
Living a mistake
More dead than alive
Then a voice appears
Whisper in your ears
“You are good enough”
Throwing down a rope
A lifeline of hope
Never give you up
 
Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well
 
Don’t ever speak my name
Remember you’re to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide

Terrified in sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you’re left behind

My lying voice inside
Keeps drinking cyanide
And no more can you run
Into the sun

Terrified, sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you’re left behind

And now you speak my name
You’ve given back the blame
Keep me deep inside
Don’t you keep me inside
Screaming suicide

Now that I’m exposed inside
Shined a light on cyanide
I’m no longer needed here
Now you've faced your biggest fear

Written by James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich & Robert Trujillo

ABOUT BTS 
BTS, an acronym of Bangtan Sonyeondan or “Beyond the Scene,” is a GRAMMY-nominated South Korean group that has been capturing the hearts of millions of fans globally since its debut in June 2013. The members of BTS are RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook. Gaining recognition for their authentic and self-produced music, top-notch performances, and the way they interact with their fans, BTS has established themselves as 21st century pop icons breaking countless world records. While imparting a positive influence through activities such as the LOVE MYSELF campaign and the UN ‘Speak Yourself’ speech, the band has mobilised millions of fans across the world (named ARMY), collected five No.1 Billboard Hot 100 singles in less than a year, performed multiple sold-out stadium shows across the world, and was named TIME’s Entertainer of the Year 2020. BTS has been nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for the 63rd GRAMMY Awards and recognised with numerous prestigious awards like the Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards and MTV Video Music Awards.

Like all songs from the album Discovery, the music video for ""Something About Us"" is a scene from the film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem, which features no dialogue, but rather songs from Discovery throughout the whole film.

↓ LYRICS ↓

It might not be the right time
I might not be the right one
But there's something about us I want to say
'Cause there's something between us anyway

I might not be the right one
It might not be the right time
But there's something about us I've got to do
Some kind of secret I will share with you

I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
I love you more than anyone in my life

↓ LYRICS ↓

In this dream, I'm dancing right beside you
And it looked like everyone was having fun
The kind of feeling I've waited so long

Don't stop, come a little closer
As we jam, the rhythm gets stronger
There's nothing wrong with just a little little fun
We were dancing all night long

The time is right to put my arms around you
You're feeling right, you wrap your arms around too
But suddenly I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it, this dream was all gone

Ooh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I wish this dream comes true

Ooh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
We'll make this dream come true

Why don't you play the game?
Why don't you play the game?

Lyrics:
It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me

Will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Lyrics:
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)

Lyrics:
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Lyrics:
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I'm about to break!

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

Lyrics:
I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you to just believe this is real

So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out

So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

No, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

Lyrics:
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside, too
And your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you, too
Right inside your skin

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

(The sun)It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin(I feel the light betray me)
(The sun)It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within(I feel the light betray me)
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within

Lyrics:
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming)Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling)Confusing what is real

Lyrics:
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

And you were there, at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

About the The Razor's Edge:
AC/DC cracked the seal on the '90s with one of the best riffs of their career. That would be ""Thunderstruck,"" the opening track on The Razors Edge. In addition to ""Thunderstruck,"" the band brought out ""Moneytalks,"" probably the closest they ever came to writing a pop song. Then there was ""Are You Ready"" - one of their fiercest calls to action. The gritty edge and booming chants on this album were a welcome reminder for a new generation that pure, unadulterated rock 'n' roll was alive and well.

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah

[Verse 1]
I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round
And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums
Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart

[Chorus]
You've been - thunderstruck

[Verse 2]
Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas
Yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah-yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

[Pre-Chorus]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind

[Chorus]
You've been - thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Oh, thunderstruck
Yeah

[Bridge 1]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yow

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said

[Bridge 2]
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine, so fine

[Chorus]
Thunderstruck, yeah-yeah-yeah
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Whoa, baby, baby (Thunderstruck)
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
You've been thunderstruck

About the album:
Years of musical knowledge and understanding had passed between Angus and Malcolm Young by the time High Voltage announced the arrival of a new Australian take on rock. With Bon Scott on board, this 1976 American release reduced rock 'n' roll down to rhythm, riffs, and raunch.

All you women who want a man of the street
Don't know which way you wanna turn
Just keep coming
And put your hand out to me
Cause I'm the one who's gonna make you burn
I'm gonna take you down
Down down down
So don't you fool around
I'm gonna pull it pull it
Pull the trigger
Shoot to thrill play to kill
Too many women too many pills, yeah
Shoot to thrill play to kill
I got my gun at the ready gonna fire at will

I wanna girl that's a heater (Hot)
Caliente, off the meter (Hot)
Yo quiero, mira, yo quiero

Toda la noche rompemo' (The night)
Al otro día volvemo' (Oh, yeah)

Baby, tonight's like fuego (The night)
We 'bout to spend the dinero (Oh, yeah)

We party to the extremo, extremo, extremo, extremo, extremo

Ritmo 

No son ni Reebok ni son Nike (No)
Sin estilista luzco fly (Yes)
La Rosalía me dice que luzco guay (La Rosalía)
No te lo niego porque yo sé lo que hay (Woo)
Lo que se ve, no se pregunta (Nah)
Soy próspero y tengo claro que e' mi culpa (Mi culpa, culpa)
Como Canelo en el ring nada me asusta
Vivo en mi base y la paz no me la tumban (Woo)
Hakuna Matata como Timón y Pumba
Voy pa' leyenda así que dale zumba
Los dejo ciego' con la vibra que me alumbra
Haters pa' la tumba, nosotros pa' la rumba (Ra)

This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm of the night

[Chorus: J Balvin, Corona, will.i.am]
Toda la noche rompemo' (The night)

Baby, tonight's like fuego (The night)
We 'bout to spend the dinero (Oh, yeah)
We party to the extremo, extremo, extremo, extremo, extremo 

Ritmo

The rhythm, the rebel
Styles upon styles upon styles, I got several
Born to be wild 'cause I live like a daredevil
Live it up, hit ‘em up, that’s the scenario 
2Pac, I get around like a merry go 
Rooftop, I am on top of the pedestal 
Flu shot, I am so sick I need medical 
Puta, I learned that shit down in Mexico (Hahaha!)
The rhythm, the rebel
New and improved I be on a new level (Oh, yeah)
That’s how we do it, we buildin’ like LEGOs (Oh, yeah)
Fuel on the fire, you dealin' with fuego
Can't stop, I am addicted I never quit
Won't stop, don't need to speak to no therapist
Don’t stop, keepin' it movin's the narrative
Nonstop, do it like Whoop! There it is 

This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm of the night

Toda la noche rompemo' (The night)
Al otro día volvemo' (Oh, yeah)
Tú sabes como lo hacemo', baby
(This is the rhythm of the night)
Baby, tonight's like fuego (The night)
We 'bout to spend the dinero (Oh, yeah)

Written & Composed by Michael Jackson

Co-Produced by Michael Jackson for MJJ Productions, Inc.
From the album Thriller, released November 30, 1982
Released as a single January 2, 1983

THE SHORT FILM
Director: Steve Barron
Primary Production Location: Los Angeles, California

Michael Jackson's short film for ""Billie Jean"" was the first of three short films produced for recordings from Thriller, which continues its reign as the biggest selling album of all time with worldwide sales in excess of 105 million as of June 1, 2016 and in December, 2015 became the first ever album to be awarded triple diamond status by the RIAA for US sales alone. The """"Billie Jean"""" single reached No. 1 in 10 countries in the spring of 1983, including seven consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 - becoming the second-highest selling single in America that same year.

""Billie Jean"" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on April 4, 1983, and Platinum on February 4, 1989. The song won two Grammy Awards for Best R&B Song and Best R&B Performance - Male, as well as an American Music Award for Favorite Single - Pop/Rock and was also named the Single of the Year on The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics' poll in 1983.

The short film featured a paparazzo attempting to photograph Jackson as he danced through an urban landscape. A specially created set featured steps and sidewalk tiles that lit up underneath Michael's feet. It is here that fans first saw some of Michael's best-known dance moves, such as spinning and landing on his toes. Many of Michael's steps and mannerisms in the video would become forever associated with The King of Pop.

When the chorus hit.he sprung into this dance that was unlike anything I'd ever seen, director Steve Barron recounted of Jackson's choreography in the video. ""It was just extraordinary, instinctive. He pulled it all together and turned it into what we saw.The camera literally steamed up, the eyepiece steamed up, because of my heat from what I was seeing."" Barron also recalled the crew breaking into spontaneous applause after Michael finished dancing.

The ""Billie Jean"" short film made history as the first video by a black artist to be played in heavy rotation on MTV, then in its second year. In 1992, the short film was inducted into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame. MTV ranked ""Billie Jean"" as the 35th greatest music video of all time in 1999, one of three entries of Jackson's on the chart alongside ""Thriller"" and ""Beat It.""

THE SHORT FILM
Director: Bruce Gowers
Primary Production Location: Los Angeles, California

Although all of Michael Jackson's music videos are referred to as short films, the short films for Off the Wall, Michael's first solo album for Epic Records, are more classic ""music videos,"" as they are performance clips rather than scripted stories.  Michael's short film for ""Rock With You"" was the second of the three short films produced for recordings from that album. The single reached No. 1 in the United States in 1980, topping Billboard's Hot 100 and Hot R&B Singles charts and reaching No. 4 on Billboard's Year-End Hot 100 chart that same year.

""Rock With You"" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on February 14, 1980, and Platinum of February 14, 1989. The song was ranked No. 82 on Rolling Stone and MTV's list of the 100 Greatest Pop Songs in 2000. In his 1988 memoir Moonwalk, Michael called ""Rock With You,"" written by Rod Temperton, ""the sort of thing I was aiming for"" in creating an album to his vision.

The short film featured Michael performing the song on a plain stage in a sequined jumpsuit and matching boots, a set of shimmering lasers illuminating his outfit from behind. Director Bruce Gowers praised Michael as ""an absolute professional"" in an interview with Rolling Stone. In 2014, the magazine would rank ""Rock With You"" No. 6 on a list of Michael Jackson's 20 Greatest Videos.

THE SHORT FILM
Director: Nick Saxon

Although all of Michael Jackson's music videos are referred to as short films, the short films for Off the Wall, Michael's first solo album for Epic Records, are more classic ""music videos,"" as they are performance clips rather than scripted stories.  Michael's short film for ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" was the first of the three short films produced for recordings from that album. The single reached No. 1 in eight countries in 1979, topping Billboard's Hot 100, Hot Soul Singles and Hot Disco Singles charts as well as the Cash Box Top 100.

""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on November 29, 1979, and Platinum on February 14, 1989. The song won Michael his first solo Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 1980, as well as his first American Music Award for Favorite Single (Soul/R&B). ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" was ranked No. 9 on the 100 Best Songs of the '70s by NME and No. 16 on VH1's list of 100 Greatest Dance Songs.

""That song means a lot to me because it was the first song I wrote as a whole,"" Michael wrote in his 1988 memoir Moonwalk. ""'Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough' was my first big chance, and it went straight to Number One. It was the song that won me my first Grammy. Quincy had the confidence in me to encourage me to go into the studio by myself, which I appreciated.""

The short film featured Michael in performance against a dazzling background of geometric shapes and patterns. Wearing a tuxedo similar to his outfit on the Off the Wall album cover, Jackson sings and dances to the song, at one point even dancing with two other clones of himself, achieved through the magic of special effects.

Lyrics:

Right from the start
You were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch youfixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts

Lyrics:

Right, right, turn off the lights
We're gonna lose our minds tonight
What's the deal, yo?
I love when it's all too much
5 a.m. turn the radio up
Where's the rock 'n roll?

Party crasher, panty snatcher
Call me up if you're a gangsta
Don't be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won'tyou come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass!""",True,True,502735560.0,dance-rock

Lyrics:

Ever wonder about what he's doing?
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think that it's better to never ask why

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, and try, and try
Gotta get up and try, and try, and try

Lyrics:

I guess I just lost my husband,
I don't know where he went,
So I'm gonna drink my money,
I'm not gonna pay his rent (nope),
I got a brand new attitude and
I'm gonna wear it tonight,
I wanna get in trouble,
I wanna start a fight,

Na na na na na na na I wanna start a fight,
Na na na na na na na I wanna start a fight.

So, so what
I'm still a rock star,
I got my rock moves,
And I don't need you,
And guess what,
I'm having more fun,
And now that we're done,
I'm gonna show you tonight,
I'm alright,
I'm just fine,
And you're a tool,
So, so what,

And I don't want you tonight""",True,True,471672024.0,Not Found

“Cover Me In Sunshine”
 
I’ve been dreaming 
friendly faces
I’ve got so much time to kill
 
just imagine 
people laughing
I know some day we will
 
and even if it’s far away
get me through another day
 
cover me in sunshine
shower me with good times
tell me that the world’s been spinning since the beginning 
and everything’ll be alright
cover me in sunshine
 
from a distance 
all these mountains
are just some tiny hills
 
wildflowers 
they keep living 
while they’re just standing still 
 
I’ve been missing yesterday 
but what if theres a better place
 
cover me in sunshine
shower me with good times
tell me that the world’s been spinning since the beginning 
and everything’ll be alright
cover me in sunshine
shower me with good times
tell me that the world’s been spinning since the beginning 
and everything’ll be alright
cover me in sunshine
 
La la la 
 
cover me in sunshine
shower me with good times
tell me that the world’s been spinning since the beginning 
and everything’ll be alright
cover me in sunshine

Lyrics:

You took my hand
You showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh huh
That's right
I took your words
And I believed
In everything
You said to me
Yeah huh
That's right

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
Cause they're all wrong
I know better
Cause you said forever
And ever
Who knew""",True,True,219363750.0,pop rock

Nate Dogg [OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO],Mydełko,1931315.0,18992.0,291.0,"‘Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you
And gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face, and collapse
Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not hip hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal cop killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not, you're gonna fear it
Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa shizzel, my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
[x2]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around
Like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney; Nate, hit me
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
[x2]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an emcee's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts
I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack, like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps, who want some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
[x2]
Until the roof (until the roof)
The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
Until my legs (until my legs)
Give out from (underneath me)
I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me",False,False,1548871694.0,hip hop music

Chorus:
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you

It’s me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

About Ed Sheeran: 
Ed Sheeran may be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: an internationally acclaimed, multi-award winning singer/songwriter who seems to acknowledge no boundaries between styles or eras with elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock woven throughout his music. 

His incredible catalogue includes the studio albums ‘+’ (plus), ‘x’ (multiply) and ‘÷’ (divide) which spawned hit singles such as ‘The A team’ , ’Lego House’, ‘Sing', ‘Thinking Out Loud’, ‘Photograph’, ‘Shape Of You’, ‘Castle on The Hill’ and ‘Perfect’. 
 
In 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’.

Lyrics: 

2X
No fue culpa tuya 
ni tampoco mía 
fue culpa de la monotonía 
nunca dije nada pero me dolía 
yo sabía que esto pasaría 

Tu en lo tuyo y haciendo lo mismo 
siempre buscando protagonismo 
te olvidaste de lo que un dia fuimos
y lo peor es que 

No fue culpa tuya 
ni tampoco mía 
fue culpa de la monotonía 
nunca dije nada pero me dolía 
yo sabía que esto pasaría 

De repente no eras el mismo
me dejaste por tu narcisismo 
te olvidaste de lo que un día fuimos 

Tu distante con tu actitud 
y eso me llenaba de inquietud 
tú no daba ni la mitad 
pero sí sé que di más que tú 
estaba corriendo por alguien       
que por mí ni estaba caminando 

Este amor no muerto pero esta delirando
ya de lo que había ya no hay na
te lo digo con sinceridad 
tu estas frío como en Navidad 
es mejor que esto se acabe ya 
no me repita la movie otra vez que esa ya la vi 

Bebe yo te quiero pero es que yo me quiero más a mí 
es un adios necesario 
lo que un día fue increíble se volvió rutinario
no me saben a nada tus labios 
ahora es todo lo contrario 
y lo peor es que

No fue culpa tuya 
ni tampoco mía 
fue culpa de la monotonía 
nunca dije nada pero me dolía 
yo sabía que esto pasaría 

Tu en lo tuyo y haciendo lo mismo 
siempre buscando protagonismo
te olvidaste de lo que un día fuimos (ambos)
eh eh eh (ambos)

Lyrics:
Por completarte me rompí en pedazos
Me lo advirtieron, pero no hice caso
Me di cuenta que lo tuyo es falso
Fue la gota que rebalsó el vaso

[Pre-Coro: Shakira]
No me digas que lo sientes
Eso parece sincero, pero te conozco bien y sé que mientes

[Coro: Shakira]
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa

Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas

[Verso 1: Shakira]
Esa filosofía barata no la compro
Lo siento, en esa moto ya no me monto
La gente de dos caras no la soporto
Yo que ponía las manos al fuego por ti
Y me tratas como una más de tus antojos
Tu herida no me abrió la piel, pero sí los ojos

Los tengo rojos de tanto llorar por ti

[Pre-Coro: Shakira]
Y ahora resulta que lo sientes
Suena sincero, pero te conozco bien y sé que mientes

[Coro: Rauw Alejandro & Shakira]
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa

Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas (Ey, dice, Ra-Rauw)

[Verso 2: Rauw Alejandro]
Hablándote claro, no te necesito (Yeah)
Perdiste a alguien auténtico (Ah)
Algo me decía por qué no fluiamo' (¡Wuh!)
Te va a picar cuando recuerde’ cómo nos comíamo' (¡Yah!)
Como ante' (Ey)
Tú de espalda apoyándote del volante (Ey)
Quemando el tranquilizante
No te bloqueé de las rede' pa' que vea' la otra en la Mercede' (¡Yah!)

[Puente: Shakira]
No me cuente’ más historia’, no quiero saber
Cómo es que he sido tan ciega y no he podido ver
Te deberían dar un Oscar, lo has hecho tan bien

[Coro: Shakira & Rauw Alejandro]
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas

You're on the front line
Everyone's watching
You know it's serious
We're getting closer
This isn't over

The pressure's on
You feel it
But you got it all
Believe it

When you fall get up, oh oh
If you fall get up, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
'Cause this is Africa

Tsamina mina, eh eh
Waka waka, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa""

Ya vas a ver como van sanando
Poco a poco tus heridas
Ya vas a ver como va
La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra del mar

hasta en tu propio país

Tu aún dices ¿Que decis?

Si es cuestion de confesar
No se preparar cafe
Y no entiendo de futbol
Creo que alguna vez fui infiel
Juego mal hasta el parques
Y jamas uso reloj
Y para ser mas franca nadie
Piensa en ti como lo hago yo
Aunque te de lo mismo
Si es cuestion de confesar
Nunca duermo antes de diez
Ni me baño los domingos
La verdad es que tambien
Lloro una vez al mes
Sobre todo cuando hay frio
Conmigo nada es facil
Ya debes saber
Me conoces bien
Y sin ti todo es tan aburrido
El cielo esta cansado ya de ver
La lluvia caer
Y cada dia que pasa es uno mas
Parecido a ayer
No encuentro forma alguna de
Olvidarte porque
Seguir amandote es inevitable
Siempre supe que es mejor
Cuando hayque hablar de dos
Empezar por uno mismo""

Lyrics:
2,3,5!
 
Maybe If I had something to say
Butterfly effect from the last three days now
Maybe if I had something to save
I used to have a soul until I threw it away
There’s shadows on the wall, wish I would’ve ran
Gotta get away I hope you understand
I try to hide my face like a wanted man 
Maybe I’ll be gone before you count to 10
 
I made up my mind this evening
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
Drink while my conscious eats me 
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
This time is the last this time is the last
 
Maybe if we went another way
I wouldn’t be regretting the decisions that I made
I don’t want to spend another day
Looking for somebody that I know I can’t replace
My tears fall you don’t miss me
Put me out my misery
Think my heart is history 
I think I’m broke and nothing can fix me
 
I made up my mind this evening
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
Drink while my conscious eats me 
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
This time is the last this time is the last
 
Yeah
We were built to fall apart
But I can’t feel you now
And it’s too late now there’s no point screaming
Dug your grave so fuck your feelings
No one’s here so now you’re on your own
 
I made up my mind this evening
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
Drink while my conscious eats me 
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
This time is the last this time is the last
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
This time is the last this time is the last

LYRICS

Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home, someone take me
Look, I didn't power through the struggle
Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions
All these miles, feets, inches
They can't add up to the distance
That I have been through, just to get to
A place where even if there's no closure, I'm still safe
I still ache from trying to keep pace
Somebody give me a sign, I'm starting to lose faith
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair?
I'm trying to find
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home(It's been a long time coming)
Someone take me
Hooooome, ho-o-o-o-me
Hooome, hooome
Someone take me
Hooooome, ho-o-o-o-me
Hoooome, hooome
Look, I been through so much pain
And it's hard to maintain, any smile on my face
'Cause there's madness on my brain
So I gotta make it back, but my home ain't on the map
Gotta follow what I'm feeling to discover where it's at
I need the (memory)
In case this fate is forever
Just to be sure these last days are better
And if I have any (enemies)
To give me the strength to look the
Devil in the face and make it home safe
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair?
I'm trying to find
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
Someone take me
Hoooome, ho-o-o-o-me
Take me home
Hoooome, hooome (take me home)
Someone take me
Hoooome, ho-o-o-o-me (someone, someone)
Nothing here feels like home(Hoooome, hooome)
(Take me home)
Someone take me
Hoooome, ho-o-o-o-me (someone, someone)
Nothing here feels like home(Hoooome, hooome)
(Take me home)
Someone take me

Lyrics:
Screaming when we fuck
Screaming when we fight yeah
Even when I’m drunk
You’re my only type yeah
 
Please don’t break my heart
I know that you might yeah
Tell me tell me now,
are you bout that life? yeah
 
Bonnie & Clyde 
ready to die 
Two
Gravesites 
later tonight 
you
Told me to stop waiting
I can feel your back breaking
Face down 
lay pipe
Water works 
swim your pool
Backstroke we both naked 
I can see that ass shaking
Damn yeah 
 
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
  
I love chaos I love toxic
I love wreckage I love falling
Pics you’re taking pics you’re cropping
It’s hard lately I’m exhausted
You hate my guts then you love me
You make me feel so disgusting
Can’t stop a runner from running
So go, go, go
You’re my only drug
You’re my only vice yeah
Fighting then we fuck
You’re my only type yeah
Mixing bad decisions up with one night stands and Hennessey
All I’ve got’s this broken heart but you can have the rest of me
 
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
 
When you come back I’ll be waiting
There’s something you’re not saying
When you come back I’ll be waiting
There’s something you’re not saying
When you come back I’ll be waiting
There’s something you’re not saying
When you come back I’ll be waiting
There’s something you’re not saying

• Lyrics: The Kid LAROI - F*CK YOU, GOODBYE

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
It's the last time I let you hurt me
Fuck you, goodbye, I did not deserve it
None of this bullshit was ever really worth it
You blame me like I know I ain't perfect
I tried with you, and I lied for you
Many times, put my life on the line for you
I really wanted to get it right with you
I always saw the better side of you
And now it's fuck you for life
I'm doin' better, you right
I was wrong 'bout you, I guess I finally realized
You brought the dark to my light
I'm with a new one tonight
But there is one last thing I want to tell you tonight

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Wait, that was a lie
Because I cannot erase you like eternal sunshine in a spotless mind
Red in the eyes, lately I've been on a cocaine diet
I've been tryin' to feed my high
Your things are still in the box that you left in the bedroom
You'll leave, and I'm here
With no heart, guess I'll be dead soon
Ghost in a shell, stone like a cemetery
Scars don't heal, I got these in February
Broke your spell, love is only temporary
Highway to hell, I'm hangin' out the roof, yellin'

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI, Machine Gun Kelly & both]
Fuck you, goodbye (Yeah)
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time

Lyrics:
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
I wrote a letter to myself
in the form of a song I can play when the sun shines
I know better than to trust
anything that I say to myself when I’m this high
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
I just did an interview with my eyes closed
I just sparked a blunt it looked like pyro
Only comments I see are the bad ones
Only playlists I like are the sad ones
 
I let the medicine in
I know it don’t help in the end
But I got depression again
I had a meeting at 7
I skipped it and slept in and woke up at 7pm
 
I cut my hair
off like I’m Britney
sparkle dust
like a pixie
Wipe my nose
like it’s itchy
I’m tatted up,
I don’t give a fuck
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
(LIL WAYNE v.)
 
When I’m this high
When I’m this high
I just looked in the mirror who is this guy
It’s a full moon
Where the good shrooms
I’m too fucking high
Sound like a good school
Higher than Jehovah
High where the heaven’s at
You know Ima get pulled over
Ima need a chauffer
Lean in my soda
So Ima need a shoulder
Why y’all got your noses up
I smell like guns and roses
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)

Letra de EQUIS ""X"" 

Aquel día te vi y tu energia sentí
Desde eso no te quiero lejos de mi
Sé que no sabes de mi y no te puedo mentir
Lo que dicen en la calle sobre mi

Y no te voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya
No te lo voy a negar (no te lo puedo negar)
Estamos claros y ya (estamos claros, estamos claros)

Solo deja que yo te agarre baby
Besos en el cuello pa' calmar la sed
Mi mano en tus caderas pa' empezar como es
No le vamo' a bajar mas nunca mamá

Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Baila
Placata Placata 
Como ella lo mueve
Sin parar, sin parar

Mis ganas de comerte
Ahora son mas fuertes
Quiero tenerte

Y no te voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya
No te lo voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya

Lo que he visto de ti mami no me es normal
Pero no te preocupes que soy anormal
Sé que tus amigas no les debo gustar

Pero ve y cuentale parte por parte
Como tenemos sex y te quito el estres
Dale otra vez

Y no te voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya
No te lo voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya

Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba- Baila
Placata Placata 
Como ella lo mueve
Sin parar, sin parar

Mis ganas de comerte
Ahora son mas fuertes
Quiero tenerte

Y no te voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya
No te lo voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya

The Avengers.

(Intro)
Lenny: Desde que estábamos en la high escribías mi nombre en tu cuaderno. 
Yo pienso en ti cuando estoy high.
Y ahora picheas pa’ comernos (vamos a vernos). 

Sech: Dame un ratito y más na’ (más na’). 
Después si quieres no te escribo más na’ (más na’).
Parezco Google buscándote.
Quiero hacer una serie que se llame “toda la noche dándote”. 
Baby

Dalex: Dime si andas con ese bobo o andas sola. 
Yo en el Mercedes y él te tiene en el Corolla.
Si un día de estos baby él a ti te descuida yo voy a hacerte mía. 

(Coro)
Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías. 

Nicky Jam: Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías. 

Sech: Te digo cuándo, hora y dónde pasa. 
Que le pague a la gente de Waze.
Pa’ que borren el location de mi casa.
Vendo noviecito cuernudo a la brasa. 
Y si mi plan fracasa mañana vuelve y pasa. 
Acuérdate cuando lo hicimos. 
En el carro, en la cocina, esta serie no termina.
Baby te tenía siempre encima. 
Piensa en un número, ya te lo imaginas.

Nicky Jam: Me dice que me vaya. 
Me pide que me quede.
Tú siempre estás jugando. 
Contigo no se puede.
Hasta que te me trepas encima, yeah. 
Te pongo disciplina, yeah.
Nunca la dejo caer. 
Siempre me pide otra vez. 
Otra vez la tengo llamándome. 
No se olvida de cómo la traté. 
Que los planes todos se los cambié. 
Y su novio ahora se volvió su ex. 

Lenny: Hey, mañana avísame si acaso te demoras.
Pa' enseñarte cómo una pussy se devora.
Una nueve-seis al revés, tú sabes como es.
En menos de una hora.

Shorty
Yo sé tus problemas con los jumper 
No te cabe el bumper. 
Yo entro en ese party.
Di que vas con tus amigas sola. 
Que en mi cama hay un party. 

Justin: ¡Ay Justin Quiles mami!
Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cuando te lo hacía. 
Cómo te venías. 

Sech: Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías.

Justin: ¿Qué fue te dio alzheimer?
Se te olvidó todas las veces que te comía en el driveway.
De desayuno, de cena.
Te batía la maizena.
Y ahora le dices que no estuve en la escena.
Para.
Deja de estar metiendo fecas.
Si te lo hice hasta dentro de la discoteca.
Por facetime te ponía a hacer caras.
Y tú te tocabas.

Feid: Dime cuándo nos tomamos el Old Fashion. 
Ponme un caption. 
Y al novio tuyo le ponemos los cachos. 
Yo quiero repetir la dosis.
Tú que no y yo que sí. 
Otro en el jacuzzi. 
Suave. 
Que tu gato ya no puede vernos pa’ comernos.
Siempre tenemos que escondernos.
Qué chimba, como en el colegio. 
Mami si te llamo es pa’ poder hacerlo.

Dalex: Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías. 

Nicky Jam: Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías. 

Rafa Pabón: Rafa Pabón
Vamos a repetirlo, tres, seis.
No hay que decirlo. 
Dime si quieres sentirlo.
Es que no es lo mismo oírlo que vivirlo.
Si lo subes mami tienes que disminuirlo.
Encima, trépate, como en el colegio.
Acuérdate. 
Quería pichar y del parque se la saqué.
Todos sus trucos ya los anoté. 
Y a su gato se la quité.

Dalex: En la cama se guayó.
Tus poses favoritas el que las sabe soy yo.
Fui un sniper, en tu cuerpo el que nunca falló.
No tiene que aceptarlo pero sé que fui yo, fui yo.

Sech: Baby

Dalex: Dime si andas con ese bobo o andas sola. 
Yo en el Mercedes y él te tiene en el Corolla.
Si un día de estos baby él a ti te descuida yo voy a hacerte mía. 

Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías. 

Nicky Jam: Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías.

Lyrics:
Si te preguntan qué pasó entrenos
Que eso se quede entre nosotros dos
No des la versión tuya
Porque eso no me ayuda

Si ni tan malo fui (eh)
Pa’ que hables mal de mi (eh)
Si no es bueno, no digas nada
Y si te cuesta quedarte callada

Ta’ bien diles que no fui el mejor
Pero no me hagas ver como un perdedor
Diles que conmigo conociste el amor
Que no eran frías mis noches en Nueva York

También diles que te hice llorar (oh, oh)
Pero que fue de felicidad (oh, oh)
Mejor pensarlo dos veces antes de hablar
No vaya a ser que tú me vayas a extrañar

Ahora me tienes como el malo del cuento a mi
Después que mi corazón completo te lo di
No te pido que regreses
Pero cuando lo beses
No puedas dejar de pensar en mi

Sé que me escucho egoísta
Pero siento que lo mío me lo quitan
De protagonista te quedó el papel
Jugando un juego donde solamente gana el, pero

Diles también que yo soy el único
Que a ti te eriza la piel
Y te pudo complacer
Cuando ‘toy borracho pienso
En todo lo intense
Que tú y yo
Tuvimos en aquel viejo hotel

Just let me know, nena
Si nada te llena
Muero, vuelvo y nazco y gano de cualquier manera
Just let me know nena
Cuando tú quieras
Te hago el amor como si nada pasó
Roooyce
Ta’ bien diles que no fui el mejor
Pero no me hagas ver como un perdedor
Diles que conmigo conociste el amor
Que no eran frías mis noches en Nueva York

También diles que te hice llorar (oh, oh)
Pero que fue de felicidad (oh, oh)
Mejor pensarlo dos veces antes de hablar
No vaya a ser que tú me vayas a extrañar

Y si te
Preguntan en tu casa
Usa más la cabeza
Luego yo con qué cara voy a beber con tu pai cerveza
Tu mai que tanto me ama
No vaya a ser que me odie
Si se entera lo que hice
Puede que no me perdone

Está cabrón lo sé
Lo nuestro lo maté
Pero fueron más cosas buenas que contigo pasé
Ayer entré a ver tus fotos
Y encontré una de nosotros
Quizás tú quieres volver
A la verdad que ‘toy loco

Ta’ bien diles que no fui el mejor
Pero no me hagas ver como un perdedor
Diles que conmigo conociste el amor
Que no eran frías mis noches en Nueva York

También diles que te hice llorar (oh, oh)
Pero que fue de felicidad (oh, oh)
Mejor pensarlo dos veces antes de hablar
No vaya a ser que tú me vayas a extrañar

Letra:

Sé
Que hay en tus ojos con solo mirar,
Que estás cansado de andar y de andar
Y caminar
Girando siempre en un lugar

Sé
Que las ventanas se pueden abrir,
Cambiar el aire depende de ti…
Te ayudará, Vale la pena una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda,
Quitarnos los miedo, dejarlos afuera…
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Vale más el presente que el futuro,
Dale suave que aquí no hay apuro
Ya salimos adelante, ya no le des mente
Y abrazo pa´ toda mi gente.

É melhor perder-se que nunca embarcar
Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
E assim será
E a vida muda, mudará.

Sé
Que en lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza algún día se irá y así será
La vida cambia y cambiará

Sentirás que el alma vuela
Por cantar una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, echarlos pa fuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro
con el corazón

Out now: http://thebeatles.lnk.to/AbbeyRoad2019
For more information visit http://abbeyroad.thebeatles.com
 
Abbey Road presented with new mixes in stereo, 5.1 surround, and Dolby Atmos; expanded with previously unreleased session recordings and demos.
 
Super deluxe 4 disc set, 3 LP deluxe vinyl, 2 CD deluxe, limited edition picture disc, CD, LP, digital and streaming. Available everywhere September 27, 2019.
 
On August 8, 1969, the world’s most famous band stepped out from London’s EMI Recording Studios to stride, single-file, across the black and white stripes of Abbey Road’s nearby zebra crossing. With photographer Iain Macmillan balanced on a stepladder and one policeman stopping the street’s light traffic, The Beatles crossed back and forth three times, led by John Lennon, followed by Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison. Just six photos were taken, with the fifth selected as the cover shot for The Beatles’ penultimate studio album, Abbey Road, named after the tree-lined street in which the studios are located.
 
Released September 26, 1969, Abbey Road was not The Beatles’ final album, as Let It Be followed in 1970, but it was the last one John, Paul, George, and Ringo recorded together as a band. The Beatles celebrated Abbey Road’s anniversary with a suite of beautifully presented packages released worldwide on September 27, 2019 by Apple Corps Ltd./Capitol/UMe. Now available, the album’s 17 tracks are newly mixed by producer Giles Martin and mix engineer Sam Okell in stereo, high res stereo, 5.1 surround, and Dolby Atmos, accompanied by 23 session recordings and demos, most of which are previously unreleased.

One day when the light is glowin'
I’ll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment
Whoa-oh, I just wanna feel this moment
Whoa-oh, I just wanna feel this moment

Put your flags up in the sky (put 'em in the sky, jogue lá no alto)
And then wave 'em side to side (side to side, lado a lado)
Show the world where you're from (show 'em where you're from, we are one, baby)
Show the world we are one (one, love, life)
Ole ole ole ola
Ole ole ole ola
Ole ole ole ola
Ole ole ole ola

Letra/Lyrics:
Chorus

Girls in the club know the deal when we come around (Daddy Yankee!)
They show us love cuz they know how we put it down (Mr Worldwide!)

Tamo’ en alta nunca le vamo’ a bajar (Play-N-Skillz!)
Ten cuidao’ con el fuego, te va a quemar (Let’s ride)
 
We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

Pit verse

That money, that money, that money we get it
And if it’s bout billions you know that we with it
And if it’s that fire, you know that we get it
Yankee, Pit, we don’t rap it we live it
Siempre somos los dueños del juego
Billones, billones, empezamos de zero
Esto no para, esto sigue, sigue
Dale Yankee dile, dile…

DY verse
(Fuego!)
Dinero Dinero ese ha sido el enfoque
Querido en el mundo y amado en los bloques
Yo creo en la higiene los chavos pal’ pote
Lavando el dinero me hice un bichote
Puré pa’ la calle lo que tiro es puro
Toa’ la familia ya estamos seguros
Los tiempos duros no duran para siempre
Los que duran para siempre son los duros.

Chorus

Girls in the club know the deal when we come around
They show us love cuz they know how we put it down

Tamo’ en alta nunca le vamo’ a bajar
Ten cuidao’ con el fuego, te va a quemar
 
We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

Girls in the club know the deal when we come around
They show us love cuz they know how we put it down

Tamo’ en alta nunca le vamo’ a bajar
Ten cuidao’ con el fuego, te va a quemar
 (Fuego!)

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
