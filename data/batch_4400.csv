Lyrics:

Jhanjhariya Uski Chanak Gayi
Chunnari Bhi Sar Se Sarak Gayi
Meri Nazar Usse Mili Toh
Uski Nazar Sharma Ke Jhuk Gayi
Jhanjhariya Uski Chanak Gayi
Chunnari Bhi Sar Se Sarak Gayi
Meri Nazar Usse Mili Toh
Uski Nazar Sharma Ke Jhuk Gayi
Jhanjhariya
 Usse Nazar Mili Beech Bazar Mein
Ha Usse Nazar Mili Beech Bazar Mein
Dil Gaya Lut Nazaron Ki Takarar Mein
Mud Mud Ke Woh Dekhe Mujhe
Jaise Ki Woh Khud Bhi Machal Gayi
Jhanjhariya Uski Chhanak Gayi
Chunnari Bhi Sar Se Sarak Gayi
Meri Nazar Usse Mili Toh
Uski Nazar Sharma Ke Jhuk Gayi
Jhanjhariya
 
Kissa Ajeeb Tha Pahali Mulaqaat Ka
Kissa Ajeeb Tha Pahali Mulaqaat Ka
Aalam Gazab Huwa Mere Dil Ke Hal Ka
Ik Pal Mujhe Aisa Laga
Jaise Meri Dhadkan Ruk Gayi
Jhanjhariya Usaki Chanak Gayi
Chunnari Bhi Sar Se Sarak Gayi
Meri Nazar Usse Mili Toh
Uski Nazar Sharma Ke Jhuk Gayi
Jhanjhariyaa Uski Chanak Gayi
Chunnari Bhi Sar Se Sarak Gayi
Meri Nazar Usse Mili Toh
Uski Nazar Sharma Ke Jhuk Gayi
Jhanjhariya

Song Lyrics:
Main Agar Saamne Aa Bhi Jaaya Karoon
Laazmi Hai Ki Tum Mujhse Parda Karo
Apni Shaadi Ke Din Ab Nahin Door Hai
Main Bhi Tadpa Karoon Tum Bhi Tadpa Karon
Bada Mushkil Hai Yeh Mera Dil Hai

Tum Hi Kaho Kaise Mein Chup Rahoon
Tum Agar Samne Aa Bhi Jaaya Karon
Laazmi Hai Ki Main Tumse Parda Karo
Apni Shaadi Ke Din Ab Nahin Door Hai

Bada Mushkil Hai Yeh Mera Dil Hai
Tum Hi Kaho Kaise Mein Chup Rahoon
Tum Agar Samne Aa Bhi Jaaya Karon
Laazmi Hai Ki Main Tumse Parda Karo

Satane Ke Manane Ke Yeh Din Hai Aazmaane Ke
Zara Samjha Karo Dilbar Tumhe Meri Kasam
Yehi Meri Hai Majboori Sahi Jaaye Na Ab Doori
Mera Kya Haal Hai Kaise Bataaon Sanam
Zameen Hogi Gagan Hoga Tera Mera Milan Hoga
Main Agar Tum Se Nazren Milaaya Karon 
Laazmi Hai Ki Tum Mujhse Parda Karo

Main Duniya Sa Chala Jaaon Kabhi Na Laut Ke Aaon
Karogi Kya Akele Tum Bataao Dilruba
Main Rab Se Cheen Laaongi Tujhe Apna Banaungi
Chale Gi Saas Jab Tak Yeh Na Hoge Hum Juda
Na Apni Yeh Kasam Tote Jo Rab Roothe To Rab Roothe

Main Agar Saamne Aa Bhi Jaaya Karoon
Laazmi Hai Ki Tum Mujhse Parda Karo
Apni Shaadi Ke Din Ab Nahin Door Hai

Dan

Dan, bila esok, datang kembali
Seperti sedia kala dimana kau bisa bercanda
Dan, perlahan kaupun lupakan aku
Mimpi burukmu, dimana t'lah ku tancapkan duri tajam
Kaupun menangis, menangis sedih
Maafkan aku

Dan, bukan maksudku, bukan inginku
Melukaimu sadarkan kau di sini kupun terluka
Melupakanmu, menepikanmu
Maafkan aku.

Lupakan saja diriku
Bila itu bisa membuatmu
Kembali bersinar dan berpijar
Seperti dulu kala

Caci maki saja diriku
Bila itu bisa membuatmu
Kembali bersinar dan berpijar
Seperti dulu kala

Dan, bukan maksudku, bukan inginku
Melukaimu sadarkan kau di sini kupun terluka
Melupakanmu menepikanmu
Maafkan aku

""Sephia""

Hey, Sephia
Malam ini ku takkan datang
Mencoba tuk berpaling sayang dari cintamu
Hey, Sephia
Malam ini ku takkan pulang
Tak usah kau mencari aku, demi cintamu

Hadapilah ini
Kisah kita takkan abadi


Reff
Slamat tidur kekasih gelapku oh Sephia…
Smoga cepat kau lupakan aku
Kekasih sejatimu takkan pernah sanggup
untuk melupakanmu
Slamat tinggal kasih tak terungkap oh Sephia…
Smoga kau lupakan aku cepat
Kekasih sejatimu takkan pernah sanggup
untuk meninggalkanmu

Hey, Sephia
Jangan pernah panggil namaku
Bila kita bertemu lagi di lain hari

Hadapilah ini
Kisah kita takkan abadi

Synopsis:
Choices... to choose between right or wrong is simple, but what defines one's life is the decision between the greater of two goods or the lesser of two evils. This is the advice that Zooni Ali Beg (Kajol) receives from her father just as she is about to venture out into the world of her own for the very first time. Little does she know that these very words will shape her life.

Zooni, a blind Kashmiri girl, meets Rehan Qadri (Aamir Khan), a local Delhi tour guide and an incorrigible flirt. Her friends warn her against this good-for-nothing roadside Romeo, but she chooses to ignore them. It is now her time to discover life and love. Is this really the right choice?

Rehan is fascinated by Zooni and wants her to see life as it should be seen, in its many colours. He promises her that the time spent with him will be the most precious in all her life. Zooni sees Delhi, life and love like she never has before, because of Rehan.

What Zooni doesn't know is that Rehan has another side of his life that he has kept from her - something that can not only change her life, but can also destroy it.

Synopsis:
Life is not always like the movies. Love isnt always at first sight. Very often, a relationship develops slowly and it takes many years between boy meets girl and boy gets girl.

Hum Tum is a refreshing look at the eternal battle of the sexes as it follows the lives of Karan (Saif Ali Khan) and Rhea (Rani Mukerji). Karan is a cartoonist and his character Hum and Tum reflect his perspective on the strange love-hate relationship between men and women. Rhea is sensitive, well bred and self confident. She can give as good as she gets and is not afraid of standing up to men.

Initially, the two have very little in common. But, as life would have it, their paths keep crossing and, over the course of a decade, their relationship evolves, from hate to mutual respect, friendship and finally...

In a cinematic universe that offers simplistic scenarios to the complex relationship between men and women. Hum Tum is a novel look at the trials and tribulations of every man and every woman and their attempts to understand one another.

Lyrics:

What we're living in?
Lemme tell ya
Yeah, it's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see, I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothing's gonna change the way we live
'Cause we can always take, but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse, see
Whoa, it's a crazy world we're living in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these
Futures made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have
For these useless, twisting, of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground
And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother can choose the color
Of her child, that's not nature's way
Well, that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do, but pray
I think it's time to find a new religion
Whoa, it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these futures
That we have to be told
Futures made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have
For these useless, twisting, of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground, wow
Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothing so bad
As a man-made man
Oh, yeah, I know, yeah (take it to the dance floor)
I know I can't go on
Of this virtual insanity we're living in
Has got to change, yeah
Things will never be the same
And I can't go on
Where we're living in
Oh, oh, virtual insanity
Oh, this world
He's got to change
'Cause I just
I just can't keep going on in this virtual, virtual insanity
That we're living in, that we're living in
And that virtual insanity is what is, yeah
Futures made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have
For these useless, twisting, of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground, oh
Futures made of, now, virtual insanity
Now we all, we seem to be governed by a love
For these useless, twisting, of our new technology
And now there is no sound, for we all live underground
Yes, we do, oh
now this life that we live in
(Virtual insanity) it's all going wrong
Out of the window (living in)
Do you know there is nothing worse than (virtual insanity)
a man-made man
(Virtual insanity) there's nothing worse than
(Living in) a foolish man

Lyrics:


I must've died and gone to heaven
Cos it was a quarter past eleven
On a Saturday in 1999
Right across from where I'm standing
On the dance floor she was landing
It was clear that she was from another time
Like some baby Barbarella
With the stars as her umbrella
She asked me if I'd like to magnetise
Do I have to go star-trekking
Cos it's you I should be checking
So she lazer beamed me with her cosmic eyes

She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
My heart's at zero gravity
She's from a cosmic world
Putting me in ecstasy
Transmitting on my frequency
She's cosmic",True,True,97289224.0,acid jazz

Lyrics

There you were freaking out
Trying to get your head around
The fact that me and you and love is dead
See how I'm tripping out
'Cause you can't decide
What you really want from me

Why does it have to be like this
I can never tell
'Cause you make me love you, love you baby
With a little L

There you were shouting out
Cranking up your altercations
Getting upset in your desperation
Screaming and hollering
How could this love become so paper thin

You're playing so hard to get
You're making me sweat just to hold your attention
I can't give you nothing more
If you ain't giving nothing to me
Don't you know that

You make me love you, love you baby
With a little L
Why does it have to be like this
I can never tell

Seems like you're steppin' on the pieces
Of my broken shell
'Cause you make me love you, love you
With a little L, you know
That's the way you make me love you, yeah

Why does it have to be like this
I can never tell
You make me love you, love you baby
With a little L

Why does it have to be like this 
(You make me love you, you make me love you)

I can never tell
(You make me love you, with a little l, that's what you do)
You make me love you, love you baby 
(You make me)
With a little L

Why does it have to be like this

I can never tell 
(That's what you do)
You make me love you, love you baby
(You make me love you, with a little l)

Lyrics:
You know this boogie is for real.

I used to buy my faith in worship,
But then my chance to Heaven slipped.
I used to worry about the future
But then I throw my caution to the wind.
I had no reason to be care free
No no no, until I took a trip to the other side of town
Yeah yeah yeah, you know I heard that boogie rhythm
Hey- I had no choice but to get down down down down.

Dance, nothing left for me to do but dance,
Off these bad times I'm going through just dance
Got canned heat in my heals tonight baby",True,True,82609296.0,trip hop

Lyrics

When I met you
You were so unique
You had a little thing I'd love to keep
Every movement
Carried much mystique
I knew right then I'd carry on
To you I knew my heart belongs

You know, you
You give me something
Something that nobody else can give
And my heart
Started thumping
You know now, you're the one I truly know I dig

Like the sunbeams from
A perfect summer day
Heaven only seems a step away
When I'm with you
I just celebrate
I'm hoping my message gets through
That there's never been someone like you

I had nobody
But on you I lean
'Cause you got these little things that I
I know I've never seen

You know now, you
You give me something
Something that nobody else has got
And this love
That I've been wanting
Oh baby, it's turning out to be too fast to stop

You know now, ooh
You give me something
Something that nobody else can give
See my heart
Has started thumping
You know babe
You're the one I truly know I dig

Ooh, will you give me something?
Ooh, will you give me something?
Ooh, will you give me something?
Ooh, will you give me something?

Ooh, will you give me something?
Ooh, will you give me something?
Ooh, will you give me something?
Ooh, will you give me something?

Lyrics:


The pebbles you've arranged
In the sand, they're strange
They speak to me like constellations
As we lie here
There's a magic I can hold
Your smile of honey gold
And that you never seem to be in short supply of

[Chorus:]
Oooh, so baby let's get it on
Drinking wine and killing time
Sitting in the summer sun
You know I've wanted you so long
Why do you have to
Drop that bomb on me?

Lazy days, crazy dolls
You said we've been friends too long
Seven days in sunny June
Were long enough to bloom
The flowers on the summer dress you wore in spring
The way we laughed as one
And then you dropped the bomb
That I've known you too long
For us to have a thing

Lyrics

Baby baby, I feel these sweet sensations, yeah
Honey honey, looks like a superstar, yeah yeah
She got a promise of lovestruck fascination, ooh
What am I to do
How am I to know
Who you are

When this love, fool-osophy is killing
Previous illusions that (I'm a love fool)
I had in my mind about you (I'm a love fool)

Seems so true, all the lies you're telling
Tragically compelling and (I'm a love fool)
My love it means nothing to you
So maybe I'm still a love fool

She shimmers like a California sunset
Lady, lady glitters, but there's no gold
She carries sweetly infectious magic formulas
I'm so delirious, is she that serious
Or is she bringing me on
I've been waiting so long

And this love, fool-osophy is killing
Previous illusions that (I'm a love fool)
I had in my mind about you (I'm a love fool)

Seems so true, all the lies you're telling
Tragically compelling and (I'm a love fool)
My love it means nothing to you
So maybe I'm still a love fool

I don't want the world, I want you, yeah
I don't want the world, I want you, you-ooh
I don't want the world, I want you

I want ya
I want ya
I want ya
I want ya

Love fool-osophy is killing
Previous illusions that
I had in my mind about you (I'm a love fool)
Seems so true, all the lies you're telling
Tragically compelling and (I'm a love fool)
My love it means nothing to you
So maybe I'm still a love fool (I'm a love fool)
My love it means nothing to you
So maybe I'm still a love fool (I'm a love fool)

You're my love foolosophy (I'm a love fool)
Don't you see it's killing me? Ooh?
You're my love foolosophy, yeah (I'm a love fool)

Lyrics:



Everything is good
And brown
Oh I'm here again
With a sunshine smile upon my face
My friends
Are close at hand
And all my inhibitions
Have disappeared without a trace
I'm glad
I found
Somebody who I can rely on.

This is the return
Of the space cowboy
Inter-planetary
Good vibe zone
At the speed of Cheeba
We'll go deeper
Maybe I'll have to get high
Just to get by.

Everything is good
And green
Oh, I'm red again
And I don't suppose I'm coming down
I can see clearly now,
High in the sky
A man with psychedelic picture frames
Of happiness to shade
His eyes
He's glad
That the found
Somebody who
He can rely on.",True,True,25416034.0,acid jazz

Lyrics:

What we're living in?
Lemme tell ya
Yeah, it's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see, I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothing's gonna change the way we live
'Cause we can always take, but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse, see
Whoa, it's a crazy world we're living in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these
Futures made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have
For these useless, twisting, of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground
And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother can choose the color
Of her child, that's not nature's way
Well, that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do, but pray
I think it's time to find a new religion
Whoa, it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these futures
That we have to be told
Futures made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have
For these useless, twisting, of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground, wow
Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothing so bad
As a man-made man
Oh, yeah, I know, yeah (take it to the dance floor)
I know I can't go on
Of this virtual insanity we're living in
Has got to change, yeah
Things will never be the same
And I can't go on
Where we're living in
Oh, oh, virtual insanity
Oh, this world
He's got to change
'Cause I just
I just can't keep going on in this virtual, virtual insanity
That we're living in, that we're living in
And that virtual insanity is what is, yeah
Futures made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have
For these useless, twisting, of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground, oh
Futures made of, now, virtual insanity
Now we all, we seem to be governed by a love
For these useless, twisting, of our new technology
And now there is no sound, for we all live underground
Yes, we do, oh
now this life that we live in
(Virtual insanity) it's all going wrong
Out of the window (living in)
Do you know there is nothing worse than (virtual insanity)
a man-made man
(Virtual insanity) there's nothing worse than
(Living in) a foolish man

Lyrics:
Un invierno en que dolía el frío 
Mi cuerpo ya no era el mío 
Iba en el ómnibus resfriado 
Mirando por el vidrio empañado 
Era linda aunque con mal aliento 
Pero le cedí la mitad de mi asiento 
Lo lamento me dijo con acento 
Al lado de un degenerado no me siento 
Ah rubia te hizo mal la lluvia! 
O tenes la mente turbia 
Soñas que te sigue un papparazi 
Con lentes negros de noche pareces un nazi 
No te acompaño en sentimiento 
Vas a morir de un ataque de pensamiento 
Y le grite en la cara congelada 
Otra rubia tarada!! 

Uh oh oh oh oh 
Alguien que de calor 
Uh oh oh oh oh 
Le pido por favor 
Uh oh oh oh oh 
Maldito invierno del 92 

Me note un ganglio inflamado 
Y un auto no freno porque estaba mojado 
Atropello a un niño sin piedad 
Lo que mata es la humedad 
Como hermano menor había heredado 
Solo este buzo agujereado 
Y sabia que al tipo de al lado 
Le sobraba un acolchado 
Cuando lo vi caminando 
Por la acera de enfrente lo fui llamando 
Primero hizo como Pilar Miro 
Después como Robinson Crusoe 
Pero me dijo el señorito 
Que en el acolchado dormía su conejito 
Que sabrás lo que es un gheto 
Otro ecologista cheto 

Uh oh oh oh oh 
Alguien que de calor 
Uh oh oh oh oh 
Le pido por favor 
Uh oh oh oh oh 
Maldito invierno del 92 

Iba en la niebla con mi dilema 
En el pulmón me salió un edema 
Y con mi aspecto de calavera 
Fui a que me viera una enfermera 
Parecía que yo deliraba 
Decía que era porque de fiebre volaba 
Volar! Dije mirando un termo 
El sueño de los hombres y los pájaros enfermos 
Esa curandera rea 
Que en una asamblea de la OEA 
El hígado me dejo como pate 
Porque me contagio con hepatitis B 
Le descubrí a esa rastrera 
Un muñeco vudú mío en la heladera 
Le eché una flema en la caldera 
Otra perra traicionera! 

Uh oh oh oh oh 
Alguien que de calor 
Uh oh oh oh oh 
Le pido por favor 
Uh oh oh oh oh 
Maldito invierno del 92 

Va a ser una larga espera 
Hasta que llegue la primavera 
Y aunque de frío voy tiritando 
Yo me sigo calentando 

Uh oh oh oh oh 
Alguien que de calor 
Uh oh oh oh oh 
Le pido por favor 
Uh oh oh oh oh 
Maldito invierno del 92 



-----
El Cuarteto de Nos comienza en el año 1984, aunque Tavella y los hermanos Musso ya tocaban juntos desde 1980, año en que dieron su primer recital totalmente instrumental en el Teatro ""El Tinglado"".

A su vez componían, y mientras buscaban su propio estilo musical, tocaban en el Teatro ""La Máscara"", en ""El Circular"", en el ""Teatro de la Alianza Francesa"", etc. A raíz de estas presentaciones el sello Ayuí les propone grabar su primer (medio) disco, que seria compartido con Alberto Wolf. La propuesta es aceptada y en el año 1984 sale a la luz.

También en 1984 se suma el cuarto integrante Álvaro Pintos como baterista fijo, ya que hasta el momento Leonardo Baroncini era quien los acompañaba como invitado.

En 1985 suben al escenario ubicado en la feria de Villa Biarritz con papel de aluminio en las piernas y globos sujetos a la cabeza, generando interés en el público.

Desde esa época la originalidad de sus múltiples shows ha dado frutos y tienen una amplia lista de seguidores de todas las edades.

Soy una Arveja, su primer LP, sale en 1986 y se presenta en 1987 en el teatro El Galpón, donde hacen oficiales los disfraces de viejas (referidos al tema undécimo del mismo disco). Estos disfraces fueron usados en innumerables presentaciones.

En 1989 recorren el país con sus presentaciones y en diciembre de 1991 se presentan por 1º vez en Argentina en la Segunda Bienal del Arte Joven

La grabación de su siguiente disco Canciones del corazón comienza en 1990, al tiempo que se presentaban un ciclo en ""La Tramoya"" y otro en el teatro del Notariado

El disco ""Canciones del Corazón"" (Orfeo), fue presentado en Teatro El Tinglado.

En 1994 se edita ""Otra navidad en las trincheras"", que es inmediatamente aceptado por público y prensa. El CD, obtiene por sus ventas los galardones de cuádruple disco de platino en Uruguay y es hasta la fecha el disco de rock más vendido en la historia del país. :)",False,False,18754267.0,Not Found

 ----LETRA COMPLETA ACÁ EN LA DESCRIPCIÓN----
Dicen que el tiempo y el olvido son hermanos gemelos 
Que el tiempo es oro y yo no pienso derrochar dinero 
Por eso antes de dormirme hoy quiero afirmar: 
¨Que este fue un dia mas y no un dia menos¨ 

El tiempo solo sana lo que ya no importa 
Parece como un dios que los pecados no perdona 
No lo puedo hacer obedecer , apurar ni detener 
Solo quiero poder aprovecharme de el 

Y usarlo como el siempre me uso 
Sin lamentarme que se me escurrio 
Por que el manana de ayer es hoy 

Voy contemplando como pasa el tiempo 
al mismo tiempo rapido y lento 
Mezcla de dualidad y cinisimo, 
miro el reloj y me dice ahora mismo 
Se que ni un segundo va devolverme, 
por eso es que hoy no quiero perder tiempo a perderme 
y si me distraigo no lo agorro 
volo volo volo volo 

El se encarga de arruinarlo y destruirlo todo 
Nos recuerda no quien fuimos sino quien somos 
Y cuando llega el turno de enfrentar , no se puede convatir 
eso lo aprendi de saturno y de crono 

Vale mas que un deja huella y no quien mas dura 
y algo que perdura puede ser abrumador 
El que se atrevio a decir que el timpo todo lo cura 
seguro que no usaba o no tenia reloj 

Soy otro anonimo en su eternidad 
por eso mi sinonimo de ¨luego¨ es ¨ya¨ 
si algo me desespera es esperar 

Voy contemplando como pasa el tiempo 
al mismo tiempo rapido y lento 
Mezcla de dualidad y cinisimo, 
miro el reloj y me dice ahora mismo 
Se que ni un segundo va devolverme, 
por eso es que hoy no quiero perder tiempo a perderme 
y si me distraigo no lo agorro 
volo volo volo volo 

Culpamos al tiempo de todos los males 
Debatiendo en una interminable tertulia 
Decimos que queremos ser inmortales 
y no sabemos que hacer en un dia de lluvia 

No lo quiero como excusa poner, 
cuando algo no logre conseguir 
No fui yo el que quise el tiempo perder, 
fue el tiempo, el que me perdio a mi 

No lo puedo desperdiciar, 
ni pensar en esconderme de el 
Aunque quieras al gallo matar 
no dejara de amanecer 

Voy contemplando como pasa el tiempo 
al mismo tiempo rapido y lento 
Mezcla de dualidad y cinisimo, 
miro el reloj y me dice ahora mismo 
Se que ni un segundo va devolverme, 
por eso es que hoy no quiero perder tiempo a perderme 
y si me distraigo no lo agorro 
volo volo volo volo.

Every You Every Me lyrics:

Sucker love is heaven sent
You pucker up, our passion's spent
My heart's a tart, your body's rent
My body's broken, yours is bent

Carve your name into my arm
Instead of stressed, I lie here charmed
Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you

Sucker love, a box I choose
No other box I choose to use
Another love I would abuse
No circumstances could excuse

In the shape of things to come
Too much poison come undone
Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Every me and every you
Every me...

Sucker love is known to swing
Prone to cling and waste these things
Pucker up for heavens sake
There's never been so much at stake

I serve my head up on a plate
It's only comfort, calling late
Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...

Like the naked leads the blind
I know I'm selfish, I'm unkind
Sucker love I always find
Someone to bruise and leave behind

All alone in space and time
There's nothing here but what here's mine
Something borrowed, something blue
Every me and every you
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...",True,True,,alternative rock

Running Up That Hill lyrics:

[Verse 1]
It doesn't hurt me (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you want to feel how it feels? (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me? (Ye-yeah,
yeah, yo)
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making? (Ye-yeah,
yeah, yo)

[Pre-Chorus]
You
It's you and me

[Chorus]
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, oh
Description
Public Facing

[Verse 2]
You don't wanna hurt me (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
But see how deep the bullet lies (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Unaware, I'm tearing you asunder (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Is there so much hate for the ones we love? (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Oh, tell me, we both matter, don't we? (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)

[Pre-Chorus]
You
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy

[Chorus]
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building (Ye-yo)
Say, if I only could, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)

[Bridge]
Oh, come on, baby (Ye-yeah)
Oh, come on, darling (Ye-yo)
Let me steal this moment from you now
Oh, come on, angel (Yeah)
Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience (Ye-oh, ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems
Say, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road

The Bitter End lyrics: 

[Verse 1]
Since we're feeling so anaesthetised
In our comfort zone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home

We're running out of alibis
On the second of May
Reminds me of the summertime
On this winter's day

[Chorus]
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end

[Verse 2]
Every step we take that's synchronised
Every broken bone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home

You shower me with lullabies
As you're walking away
Reminds me that it's killing time
On this fateful day


[Chorus]
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end

[Outro]
From the time we intercepted
Feels a lot like suicide
Slow and sad, grown inside us
Arouse and see you're mine
(See you at the bitter end)

Love has seen your run-around
Who wanna seek you now?
I want a peace
I'd whine out
(See you at the bitter end)

Love's reached his side
Grab this gentleness inside
Heard a cry
Six feet down
(See you at the bitter end)
In six weeks' time
The mess you left
Will end",True,True,82773574.0,alternative rock

Special Needs lyrics: 

[Verse 1]
Remember me when you're the one who's silver screened
Remember me when you're the one you always dreamed
Remember me whenever noses start to bleed
Remember me, special needs

[Chorus]
Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavour
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behaviour

[Verse 2]
Remember me when you clinch your movie deal
And think of me stuck in my chair that has four wheels
Remember me through flash photography and screams
Remember me, special dreams

[Chorus]
Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavour
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behaviour
Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavour
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behaviour

[Bridge]
Remember me
Remember me

[Chorus]
Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavour
Just 19, a dream obscene

Song To Say Goodbye lyrics: 

[Verse 1]
You are one of God's mistakes
You crying, tragic waste of skin
I'm well aware of how it aches
And you still won't let me in

Now, I'm breaking down your door
To try and save your swollen face
Though I don't like you anymore
You lying, trying waste of space

[Chorus]
Before our innocence was lost
You were always one of those
Blessed with lucky sevens
And a voice that made me cry
My, oh, my

[Verse 2]
You were mother nature's son
Someone to whom I could relate
Your needle and your damage done
Remains a sordid twist of fate

Now, I'm tryin' to wake you up
To pull you from the liquid sky
'Cause if I don't, we'll both end up
With just your song to say goodbye
My, oh, my

A song to say goodbye
A song to say goodbye
A song to say

[Chorus]
Before our innocence was lost
You were always one of those
Blessed with lucky sevens
And a voice that made me cry

[Outro]
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye",True,True,34965612.0,alternative rock

This Picture lyrics: 

[Intro]
I hold an image of the ashtray girl
Of cigarette burns on my chest
I wrote a poem that described her world
And put our friendship to the test
And late at night
Whilst on all fours
She used to watch me kiss the floor
What's wrong with this picture?
What's wrong with this picture?

[Verse 1]
Farewell the ashtray girl
Forbidden snowflake
Beware this troubled world
Watch out for earthquakes
Goodbye to open sores
To broken semaphore
You know we miss her
We miss her picture

[Chorus]
Sometimes it's fated
Disintegrated
For fear of growing old
Sometimes it's fated
Assassinated
For fear of growing old

[Verse 2]
Farewell the ashtray girl
Angelic fruitcake
Beware this troubled world
Control your intake
Goodbye to open sores
Goodbye and furthermore
You know we miss her
We miss her picture

[Chorus]
Sometimes it's fated
Disintegrated
For fear of growing old
Sometimes it's fated
Assassinated
For fear of growing old

[Bridge]
Hang on
Though we try
It's gone
Hang on
Though we try
It's gone

[Chorus]
Sometimes it's fated
Disintegrated
For fear of growing old
Sometimes it's fated
Assassinated
For fear of growing old

[Outro]

Pure Morning lyrics:

[Verse 1]
A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend with weed is better
A friend with breasts and all the rest
A friend who's dressed in leather
A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who'll tease is better
Our thoughts compressed, which makes us blessed
And makes for stormy weather

[Verse 2]
A friend in need's a friend indeed
My Japanese is better
And when she's pressed, she will undress
And then she's boxing clever
A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who bleeds is better
My friend confessed she passed the test
And we will never sever

[Chorus]
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning

[Verse 3]
A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who'll tease is better
Our thoughts compressed, which makes us blessed
And makes for stormy weather
A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who bleeds is better
My friend confessed she passed the test
And we will never sever,

[Chorus]
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning

[Verse 4]
A friend in need's a friend indeed
My Japanese is better
And when she's pressed, she will undress
And then she's boxing clever

Special K lyrics: 

Coming up beyond belief
On this coronary thief
More than just the leitmotif
More chaotic, no relief

I'll describe the way I feel
Weeping wounds that never heal
Can the saviour be for real
Or are you just my seventh seal?

No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like Special K
Just like I swallowed half my stash
And never ever wanna crash
No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like Special K
Now you're back with dope demand
I'm on sinking sand

Gravity, no escaping
Gravity
Gravity, no escaping
Not for free
I fall down, hit the ground
Make a heavy sound
Every time you seem to come around

I'll describe the way I feel
You're my new Achilles' heel
Can the saviour be for real
Or are you just my seventh seal?

No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like Special K
Just like I swallowed half my stash
And never ever wanna crash
No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like Special K
Now you're back with dope demand
I'm on sinking sand

Gravity, no escaping
Gravity
Gravity, no escaping
Not for free
I fall down, hit the ground
Make a heavy sound
Every time you seem to come around

You try this trick and spin, yeah

Where is my mind? Where is my mind?
Where is my mind? Where is my mind?
Way out, in the water see her swimmin'

I was swimmin' in the Caribbean
Animals were hiding behind the rocks, yeah
Except the little fish but he told me east is west
They tryin' to crack

Bring me back to life
Never let me go 
Your troubles and your strife
I saw them 
Take me by the hand 
As we cross through battlefields
Nobody understands
‘Cause there's nobody at the wheel 
 
Beautiful James 
I don’t want to wake you 
Beautiful James 
I don’t want to wake you 
 
Everybody lies 
One hundred times a day 
The silence in your eyes 
Is far too rare to give away 
And it's exactly why I stay

If I’ve heard it once I’ve heard it a thousand fucking times 
The voices in my head keep telling me I’m doing fine 
I say it with a straight face that it's just another line 
But it's more than that
‘Cos there's no way back

Here I go I’m trippin’ where have I been 
I got a feelin’ like i'm slippin’, I’m on my knees 
Just wanna run, will I ever, ever be free
It’s now or never
It’s time to sink or swim 
 
‘Cos I’m going off the deep end 
Yeah I'm drowning inside 
And it doesn't feel important if I’m dead or alive 
Feeling fifty shades of fucked up 
Going out of my mind 
I don't wanna face my demons 
So let's get the party started 
 
God damn this’ll make me sick
Fuck my life ‘cos I’m done with it 
Can't fix me ‘cos you don’t know shit 
Better be scarred than to not have lived

I'm so happy I could die right now, yeah 
I'm so happy I could die right now

LYRICS:

Nobody said it would be easy 
Nobody said that it would all be fine 
But to get where we're going 
Brother you’ve gotta hold the line 
It ain’t a matter of if,
Nah, it's just a matter of time 
But to get where we're going 
Sister gotta hold the line 
 
You gotta stay steadfast
Tread lightly
‘Cause they’re looking for a reason to knock you down 
But you can't ask too politely
In the trenches you gotta get loud 
 
Hold the line 
Hold the line 
Don't pay ‘em no mind
Oh, hold the line
Hold the line 
 
Nobody said it happens overnight 
but if you're looking for a sign
Remember everybody that stood up before you 
Oh they hold the line
They wanna tell you you're already free 
Put these chains on and rob you blind 
When they co-op the movement 
Don't trip just hold the line
Hold the line, 
Hold the line 
 
Hold the line 
Hold the line 
Don't pay ‘em no mind
Oh, hold the line

You gotta stay steadfast
Tread lightly
‘Cause they’re looking for a reason to knock you down 
But you can't ask too politely
In the trenches you gotta get loud 
 
You gotta stay steadfast
Tread lightly
‘Cause they’re looking for a reason to knock you down

LYRICS

Yeah I'm pleasure and I'm worth the pain
Just like thunder always follows rain
Peel you out in fire, smoke and wheels
I'll be your hero from the movie reels
With my style that's instant classic
That looks fast and magic
Well you wanna a chase and that’s alright
I'm coming fully loaded and you're in my sights tonight

I'm a wild child
Born on a blood red moon
Baby don’t you cry it's fine if I die too soon
Not afraid to admit
I'd only be scared if I never lived
I'm your wild child
Born on a blood red moon

Scratch your number right onto my chest
Hit me up and you can call for sex
Keep in mind I like to be impressed
I'll only have you in your Sunday best
It's been a while since we've been flirting
But one thing’s for certain
you should take your time to think me through
Cause every rumour that you've heard is true c'mon

I'm a wild child
Born on a blood red moon
Baby don’t you cry it's fine if I die too soon
Not afraid to admit
I'd only be scared if I never lived
I'm your wild child
Born on a blood red moon (moon)

I'm your wild child
Born on a blood red moon
Baby don’t you cry it's fine if I die too soon
Not afraid to admit
I'd only be scared if I never lived
I'm your wild child

LYRICS:
Oh my god, I’m an animal
Oh my god, I’m ‘a have it all
I’m losing, I’m losing my way back to human

Hands up chief
Get the bit in your teeth
Or they never will remember your name

We fight fire with fire
Would you call me a liar
If I told you that I wasn’t afraid

Sweet as sweat
Are you feeling it yet
Yeah, long may your family reign

Better shake those hips
If there’s death on your lips
Or you never will be dancing again

Cannibalism
The modern religion
We’re riding a ticket to nowhere
And carry the vision
I do what I do to survive

Oh my God
I’m an animal
Oh my God
I’m ‘a have it all

I’m losing
I’m losing
My way back
To human

Oh my God
I’m an animal
Swear to God
It’s my curtain call

I’m losing
I’m losing
My way back
To human

Blood for blood
If you’re ready or not
Get your finger on the murder machine

And if faith is blind
In your enemy’s eyes
Then boy you better make ‘em believe

And cannibalism
The modern religion
We’re riding a ticket to nowhere
And carry the vision
I do what I do to survive

Oh my God
I’m an Animal
Oh my God
I’m ‘a have it all

I’m losing
I’m losing
My way back
To human

Oh my God
I’m an animal
Swear to God
It’s my curtain call

I’m losing
I’m losing
My way back
To human

Oh my God
I’m an Animal
Oh my God
I’m ‘a have it all

I’m losing
I’m losing
My way back
To human

Oh my God
I’m an animal
Swear to God
It’s my curtain call

I’m losing
I’m losing
My way back
To human",True,True,4327317.0,alternative metal

LYRICS:
Livin’ easy
Livin’ free 
Season ticket on a one way ride
Askin’ nothin’
Leave me be 
Takin’ everythin’ in my stride 
Don't need reason
Don't need rhyme
Ain't nothin’ that I'd rather do 
Goin’ down
Party time
My friends are gonna be there too

I'm on a highway to hell
I'm on a highway to hell
I'm on a highway to hell
I'm on a highway to hell

No stop signs
No speed limit
Nobody’s gonna slow me down
Like a wheel
Gonna spin it
Nobody’s gonna mess me around
Hey Satan
Payin’ my dues
Playin’ in a rockin’ band
Hey Momma
Look at me
I’m on the way to the promised land

I'm on a highway to hell
I'm on a highway to hell
I'm on a highway to hell
I'm on a highway to hell

Don't stop me 

I'm on a highway to hell

“Head Like A Hole” Lyrics
God money I'll do anything for you.
God money just tell me what you want me to
God money nail me up against the wall. 
God money don't want everything he wants it all. 
No you can't take it 
No you can't take it 
No you can't take that away from me 
No you can't take it 
No you can't take it 
No you can't take that away from me 
Head like a hole. 
Black as your soul. 
I'd rather die than give you control. 
Head like a hole. 
Black as your soul. 
I'd rather die than give you control. 
Bow down before the one you serve. 
You're going to get what you deserve. 
Bow down before the one you serve. 
You're going to get what you deserve.
God money's not looking for the cure. 
God money's not concerned with the sick among the pure. 
God money let's go dancing on the backs of the bruised. 
God money's not one to choose 
No you can't take it 
No you can't take it 
No you can't take that away from me 
No you can't take it 
No you can't take it 
No you can't take that away from me 
Head like a hole. 
Black as your soul. 
I'd rather die than give you control. 
Head like a hole. 
Black as your soul. 
I'd rather die than give you control. 
Bow down before the one you serve. 
You're going to get what you deserve. 
Bow down before the one you serve. 
You're going to get what you deserve. 
Bow down before the one you serve 
You're going to get what you deserve. 
Bow down before the one you serve. 
You're going to get what you deserve. 
Head like a hole. 
Black as your soul. 
I'd rather die than give you control. 
Head like a hole. 
Black as your soul. 
I'd rather die than give you control. 
Head like a hole. 
Black as your soul. 
I'd rather die than give you control. 
Head like a hole. 
Black as your soul. 
I'd rather die than give you control.
Bow down before the one you serve. 
You're going to get what you deserve. 
Bow down before the one you serve. 
You're going to get what you deserve. 
Bow down before the one you serve. 
You're going to get what you deserve. 
Bow down before the one you serve. 
You're going to get what you deserve.

Letra:
No se entiende el menú 
pero la salsa abunda. 
Soy un gourmet que huele eternamente mal. 
Viejas compotas que no dan respiro 
al caníbal que hay en mí 
(que no es bien recibido en un banquete así). 

Se amasan las fortunas, se cargan los bolsillos 
de presa seca, de oro falso de vermouth. 
Me acaban el cerebro a mordiscos, 
bebiendo el jugo de mi corazón 
y me cuentan cuentos al ir a dormir. 

A un cordero de mi estilo 
a un caníbal de mi estilo. 

Voy al Coliseo a prenderme fuego 
(mi racha de novato nunca cambiará). 
¡Por favor! que el adiós no se alargue 
me cansé de tanto esperar... 
cuando el fuego crezca quiero estar allí. 

Un cordero de mi estilo 
a un caníbal de mi estilo.


Ficha técnica:
Durante los meses de Marzo a Julio, en las míticas instalaciones de ""Del Cielito Records"", se sucedieron infinidad de lances sónicos que fueron culminando con variada suerte...
Una vez más, hipotecando sus almas, un destacado grupo de catchers vistió los tradicionales coloresde Lupus y del Rulo.
Las respectivas divisas fueron defendidas, alternadamente, por los siguientes accidentes biológicos:

En puros pases de trinchera:
El trompita Bucciarelli
Walter ""Arcano"" Sidotti
Herodes Dawi
Herr Professor Beilinson
Lo Indio Moulinex

Banderillas:
Sergio Poli= violín - bluezcarda en ""Espejismo"" y ""Un ángel para tu soledad"".
Guillermo ""dedo brujo"" Piccolini= teclados en ""Caña seca y un membrillo"" y ""Sorpresa de Shangai"".
Los lances originales son otro producto descarnado del Indio ""Moulinex y Herr Professor"".
Surfing channel a cargo del grumete midi Hernán Aramberri.
El control etéreo fue ejercido por el mariscal Breuer y su ""stuntmaster"" personal Barry Brodsky susurró en ""Lavi - Rap"".

En el picadero: Las gemelas Poly & Heidi soldaron corazones con sus caricias y el maestro Rocambole y Semiya consiguieron con sus visiones que los paquetes quedaran muy lindos, aunque laserizados por Meroyuela.

Desde el burladero (aquel inolviable aporte): Vlad Gauvry - Adrián Rivarola - Guido ""oruga manisera"" Nisenson - Diana Maravilla - Murray Broadway - Marta - Claudio Kleiman - Negro Vargas - Piojo Ávalos - Cacho Soldado y El Niño Herrera.

Axioma principal de esta porfía: ""Cuando el carro anda, los melones se acomodan"".

Letra:
Fue unos meses a Caseros y su ""strato"" roja 
se hizo el torbellino que hoy suena en la radio. 
La ceniza no caía desde su cigarro 
y estaba en sus ojos desarmándote. 

Alquiló una rana rubia, tibia y haragana; 
se moría de ganas de matarla. 
Una linda damita de Concordia, 
el más bello fuselaje que jamás lustró. 

Le hizo un par de promesas imprudentes 
y así fue que de ella se aburrió. 
Las minitas aman los payasos 
y la pasta de campeón. 

El pibe de los astilleros nunca se rendía, 
tuvo un palacete por un par de días. 
Rapiñaba montado a los containers 
el maldito amor que tanto miedo da. 

Fue por una lluvia que realmente moje 
(que pusiera fin a su aventura). 
Un final feliz para pimpollos 
allí estaba, ¡al fin!, acechándolo. 

Ciertos reyes no viajan en camello; 
ellos andan el tranco del amor. 
Ésos tipos soplan con el viento 
al rebaño y su temor.

Lyrics:

Here I am in the place where I come let go
Miami the base and the sunset glow
Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, lay to rest the spill
Me an Charlie at the bar runnin up a high bill
Nothin less than ill, when we dress to kill
Everytime the ladies pass, they be like (Hi Will)
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But everytime I come I always wind up stayin
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Buenvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami

Directed by Guy Ritchie (“Sherlock Holmes,” “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.”), who brings his singular flair for fast-paced, visceral action to the fictitious port city of Agrabah, “Aladdin” is written by John August (“Dark Shadows,” “Big Fish”) and Ritchie based on Disney’s “Aladdin.” The film stars Will Smith (“Ali,” “Men in Black”) as the larger-than-life Genie; Mena Massoud (“Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan”) as the charming scoundrel Aladdin; Naomi Scott (“Power Rangers”) as Jasmine, the beautiful, self-determined princess; Marwan Kenzari (“Murder on the Orient Express”) as Jafar, the powerful sorcerer; Navid Negahban (“Legion”) as the Sultan concerned with his daughter’s future; Nasim Pedrad (“Saturday Night Live”) as Dalia, Princess Jasmine’s free-spirited best friend and confidante; Billy Magnussen (“Into the Woods”) as the handsome and arrogant suitor Prince Anders; and Numan Acar (“The Great Wall”) as Hakim, Jafar’s right-hand man and captain of the palace guards.

“Aladdin” is produced by Dan Lin, p.g.a., (“Sherlock Holmes”) and Jonathan Eirich, p.g.a., (“Death Note“) with Oscar® nominee and Golden Globe® winner Marc Platt (“La La Land”) and Kevin De La Noy (“The Dark Knight Rises”) serving as executive producers.

Lyrics

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit lonely
And you're never coming round

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit nervous
That the best of all the years have gone by

(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
And then I see the look in your eyes

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then
I fall apart

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit restless
And I dream of something wild

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit helpless
And I'm lying like a child in your arms

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit angry
And I know I've got to get out and cry

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit terrified
But then I see the look in your eyes

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then
I fall apart
Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then
I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong

Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)

I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks

I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
(Forever's gonna start tonight)

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

(Turn around, bright eyes)
(Turn around, bright eyes)

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know you'll never be the boy
You always wanted to be

(Turn around)
But every now and then
I know you'll always be the only boy
Who wanted me the way that I am

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know there's no one in the universe
As magical and wondrous as you

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know there's nothing any better
There's nothing that I just wouldn't do

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong

Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)

I don't know what to do
I'm always in the dark
Living in a powder keg and giving off sparks

I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
(Forever's gonna start tonight)

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart

Lyrics;

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down
It's a fool's game
Nothing but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown
It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Love him 'til your arms break
Then he let's you down
It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you
Oh, it's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down
It's a fool's game
Nothing but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown
It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you
Oh, it's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
You love him 'til your arms break
Then he let's you down
It's a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feelin' like a clown
It's a heartache
Love him 'til your arms break
Then he let's you down
It's a fool's game

Lyrics

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit lonely
And you're never coming round

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit nervous
That the best of all the years have gone by

(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
And then I see the look in your eyes

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then
I fall apart

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit restless
And I dream of something wild

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit helpless
And I'm lying like a child in your arms

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit angry
And I know I've got to get out and cry

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit terrified
But then I see the look in your eyes

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then
I fall apart
Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then
I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong

Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)

I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks

I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
(Forever's gonna start tonight)

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

(Turn around, bright eyes)
(Turn around, bright eyes)

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know you'll never be the boy
You always wanted to be

(Turn around)
But every now and then
I know you'll always be the only boy
Who wanted me the way that I am

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know there's no one in the universe
As magical and wondrous as you

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know there's nothing any better
There's nothing that I just wouldn't do

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong

Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)

Lyrics:

How's it feel to be a woman
How's it feel to be a man
Are we really that different
Tell me where you stand
I look at you, you look away
Why do you say we're night and day
I'd like to try another way
Oh baby for just one day

Would it be so hard to understand

Lyrics:

Je tourne en rond
Tu sais que quelques fois je me sens seule et perdue
Est-ce que tu me reviendras?
Je tourne en rond
Tu sais que quelquefois je me sens loin de toi
Dis, est-ce que tu te souviendras de moi?
Je tourne en rond
Sur la terre entière je me sens abandonnée
Dis, est-ce que tout ça va changer?
Je tourne en rond
Pour habiter ma solitude de mon mieux
Moi qui ne sais qu'être deux
Je tourne en rond sans toi
Tu sais que quelquefois j'ai peur de toi
Je tourne en rond sans toi
Tu sais que quelquefois j'ai peur de moi
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit restless
When I dream of something wild
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit helpless
And I'm like a child in your arms
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit angry
And I know I've got to get out and cry
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
When I see the look in your eyes
Je tourne en rond sans toi
Tu sais que quelquefois j'ai peur de toi
Je tourne en rond sans toi
Tu sais que quelquefois j'ai peur de moi
Et j'ai tant besoin de toi
Et j'ai tant besoin de ta voix
Je veux tomber dans tes bras
Je voudrais marcher dans tes pas
On invente les règles du jeu
Quand on est tous les deux
Ensemble nous irons jusqu'au bout du chemin
Je tiendrai dans ton ombre
Si tu me prends la main (all of the time)
Retiens-moi si je sombre, je suis ta prisonnière
Si loin de notre monde j'ai la tête à l'envers
J'ai vraiment besoin de toi
Si demain commençait ce soir
Si demain commençait ce soir
Il était une fois une femme amoureuse
Peut-être un p'tit peu trop rêveuse
Tant pis si j'en pleure
Tu as tous les droits sur mon cœur
A total eclipse of the heart
Et j'ai tant besoin de toi
Et j'ai tant besoin de ta voix
Et je veux tomber dans tes bras
Je voudrais marcher dans tes pas

Lyrics

I'll take the train to nowhere
This love is a sacrifice
My heart ain't big enough babe
For your paradise...
Oh darling I'm crazy - after all these years

Don't throw away my love babe
I'm not a lonely child
Tomorrow's such a long time
My dreams are running wild...
Oh Darling I'm crazy - after all these years

I gave you all my love for free
My tears are full of memories
Give me love, give me all
Baby, catch me when I'll fall tonight

Bitterblue, Bitterblue
Breaking up is hard to do
Bitterblue you know that I'm too
Proud to cry
Bitterblue, Bitterblue
I can't take my eyes off you
That's no way to say goodbye

I'll be sailing on a rainbow
If you will change your mind
Don't throw away this love babe
Love is hard to find...
Oh darling I'm crazy - after all these years

Come save a little room babe
In your heart for me
We can make it better
Love is a mystery...
Oh darling I'm crazy - after all these years

Oh I sold my heart to you
I gave you love and heaven, too
Give me love, give me all
Baby catch me when I'll fall tonight

Bitterblue, Bitterblue
Breaking up is hard to do
Bitterblue you know that I'm too
Proud to cry
Bitterblue, Bitterblue
I can't take my eyes off you
And that's no way to say goodbye

Bitterblue, Bitterblue
Breaking up is hard to do
Bitterblue you know that I'm too
Proud to cry
Bitterblue, Bitterblue
I can't take my eyes off you
And that's no way to say goodbye

The children bound in bright steps to the march of the music and perform a dance around the Christmas tree.

The Nutcracker by Sir Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic (Berliner Philharmoniker) remains one of the most iconic recordings of Tchaikovsky’s beloved ""fairy ballet"". Long after its premiere on December 18, 1892, the Romantic-Era masterpiece has become a staple of the Christmas season in both its original ballet and orchestral forms. Listen to the full album here: https://wce.lnk.to/ntc

Many of its numbers have become world-famous themes, especially prominent in classical music performances and pop culture around the holidays: from the extraordinary opening Miniature Overture to the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, Waltz of the Flowers, Dance of the Reed Flutes, March from Act I, and Trepak (Russian Dance). Conductor Sir Simon Rattle calls The Nutcracker “one of the great miracles in music.”

Their spellbinding performances harvested a bumper crop of critical superlatives. Here was “history in the making”, wrote The Times in its five-star review, while Bachtrack noted, “Purity and clarity are hallmarks of Zimerman’s playing and there was an almost aristocratic composure to his phrasing and a velvet touch … Everything was meticulous, not … a quaver out of place.”

Tracing a path from Classicism to Romanticism, the five works are masterpieces of a genre revolutionised by Beethoven. It was as a virtuoso pianist that he first made his name and he premiered all but the Fifth Concerto himself – his deafness was so serious by then that he no longer felt confident about performing in public.
