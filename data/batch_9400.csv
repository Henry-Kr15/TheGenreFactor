Lyrics:

People get ready
There's a train a-coming
You don't need no baggage
You just get on board
All you need is faith
To hear the diesels humming
Don't need no ticket
You just thank the Lord

People get ready
For the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers
From coast to coast
Faith is the key
Open the doors and board them
There's room for all 
Among the loved the most

There ain't no room
For the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just
To save his own
Have pity on those 
Whose chances are thinner
Cause there's no hiding place
From the Kingdom's Throne",True,True,14131429.0,rock music

Chorus:
We can’t both become the same pawn that's made to fall
Oil that tastes like
Blood stole the summer scent
From me to you, you're stabbing me through you
You're stabbing you through him
And betting most of this world
We’ll add enough of the world

Jamaican superstar Vybz Kartel is up next on the Mixpak roster, delivering the Dre Skull produced ‘Yuh Love,’ a poppy dancehall anthem just in time for the end of summer. Kartel gives us his deejay ternt singjay and ‘Yuh Love’ — in which he offers a promise of undying love — acts as the ying to his recent smash hit “Romping Shop’s” yang. Dre Skull keeps the production understated, but infectious. Play this in the car, play this in the club…your endless summer starts now!

Directed by Terminal 4 Media in Jamaica.

Tuff London are fast becoming the most exciting new house duo in the Country. Their debut release ‘Sending Love’ was a huge success that saw a top 20 position on Beatport, inclusion on the recent Space album on Carl Cox’s disc and countless Radio One plays from Danny Howard.
Welcome to the follow up. ‘Front Line’ is a peak-time house record with a chunky, rolling groove that sits alongside some old school hoover stabs and insanely catchy and quirky vocals courtesy of Steve Edwards that add that daytime accessibility and instant hook. This is another string to Tuff London’s bow ahead of a single release on Danny Howards’ Nothing Else Matters label in October. These guys are destined for big things!

Ahead of the celebratory retrospective album 'Twenty' in July 2016 comes the single, 'Carry Me Home', featuring the vocals of Mr Steve Edwards. Although the album highlights Chicane from the beginning in 1996, the re-working of the Gloworm single from the 90's, proves Chicane still has an ear to inject his own inimitable slant on a song, one that is fresh and currant, as would be expected of someone who has sold over 5 million records, and written and performed some of the seminal classics of the dance genre over course of his career; working with artists like Steve and artists as diverse as, Bryan Adams, Duane Harden, Lisa Gerrard, Sir Tom Jones, Natasha Beddingfield. The album Twenty also has some remixes of the classic tracks by some of the currant stars of the dance world.

Letra/Lyrics:

Theres nothing more that I want
than to touch you
To seek truth
in your eyes

The only thing that I want
is to be with you,
And t
Watch the su(uuu)nri(iii)se

Everytime I see the sunset in your eyes
Words can not express the feeling deep inside
Your fire gives me sweet inspiration
And when the morning comes
You bring like, like a sunrise, su(uuu)nri(iii)se

Theres nothing more that I want
Than to touch you, feel you
To seek truth,
In your eyes

The only thing that I want
Is to be with you
And to
Watch the su(uuu)nri(iii)se

Theres nothing more that I want
Than to touch you
To seek truth
in your eyes

The only thing that I want
Is to be with you, feel you
And to
Watch the su(uuu)nri(iii)se

Every-time i feel the pressure start to rise
Heaven only knows the way you satisfy
You fire gives me sweet consolation
And when the morning comes
You bring like, like a sunrise, su(uuu)nri(iii)se


Watch the su(uuu)nri(iii)se

Theres nothing more that I want,
Than to touch you,
To seek truth,
In your eyes

The only thing that I want,
Is to be with you, 
And to watch the su(uuu)nri(iii)se

Theres nothing more that I want,
Than to touch you,
To seek truth,

Subscribe to the Armada Music YouTube channel: http://bit.ly/SubscribeArmada

Ahead of the celebratory retrospective album 'Twenty' in July 2016 comes the single, 'Carry Me Home', featuring the vocals of Mr Steve Edwards. Although the album highlights Chicane from the beginning in 1996, the re-working of the Gloworm single from the 90's, proves Chicane still has an ear to inject his own inimitable slant on a song, one that is fresh and currant, as would be expected of someone who has sold over 5 million records, and written and performed some of the seminal classics of the dance genre over course of his career; working with artists like Steve and artists as diverse as, Bryan Adams, Duane Harden, Lisa Gerrard, Sir Tom Jones, Natasha Beddingfield. The album Twenty also has some remixes of the classic tracks by some of the currant stars of the dance world.

Lyrics: 
Rolling down a backwoods Tennessee byway
One arm on the wheel
Holding my lover with the other
A sweet soft southern thrill
Worked hard all week
Got a little jingle
On a Tennessee Saturday night
Couldn't feel better
I'm together with my dixieland delight
Spend my dollar
Parked in a holler 'neath the mountain moonlight
Holdin' her up tight
Make a little lovin'
A little turtle dovin' on a Mason Dixon night
It's my life
Oh so right
My dixieland delight
Whitetail buck deer munchin' on clover
Red-tailed hawk sitting on a limb
Chubby ol' groundhog
Croakin' bullfrog
Free as a feeling in the wind
Home grown country girl
Gonna give me a whirl
On a Tennessee Saturday night
Lucky as a seven
Livin' in Heaven
With my dixieland delight
Spend my dollar
Parked in a holler 'neath the mountain moonlight
Holdin' her up tight
Make a little lovin'
A little turtle dovin' on a Mason Dixon night
It's my life
Oh, so right
My dixieland delight
Spend my dollar
Parked in a holler 'neath the mountain moonlight
Holdin' her up tight

Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walking in high cotton

Lyrics: 
Family ties run deep in this land
And I'm never very far from what I am

I was born country, and that's what I'll always be
Like the rivers and the woodlands, wild and free
I got a hundred years of down home runnin' through my blood
I was born country, and this country's what I love

Lyrics

WAKE UP GO TO SLEEP REPEAT INFINITE

HOPES BY THE PLENTY I DONT GET EM NO DIFFERENCE

IVE BEEN TRYING MY HARDEST I NEVER REALLY BEEN TO GOOD AT CHANGING

About Bad Boy Entertainment:

In 1993, Sean “Puff Daddy” Combs, also known as Diddy, launched Bad Boy Records. Nobody could have
imagined the impact the label would have on pop culture. As a subsidiary of the larger Bad Boy
Entertainment, the label became best known for its signature sound of streetwise hip-hop soul and the
ghetto fabulousness that radiated like precious jewels from its very name. Bad Boy was designed for
those who aspired higher, but also wanted to party until the break of dawn. Puffy had seen life from
both sides of the class divide and, with his groove-heavy music, worked hard to merge the two. There is
no better visual embodiment of this merger than the groundbreaking videos that were in heavy rotation
on BET and MTV and now on YouTube.

The Bad Boy Entertainment channel is the official YouTube home of iconic music videos from Puff
Daddy, Craig Mack, Faith Evans, 112, Total, Mase, Yung Joc, Cassie, Danity Kane, and the rest of the Bad
Boy Family, and your destination for some of the biggest 90s and 00s hip-hop hits of all time like Craig
Mack’s “Flava In Your Ear (Remix)”, the Notorious B.I.G. tribute “I’ll Be Missing You” by Puff Daddy feat.
Faith Evans and 112, and Cassie – “Me & U”.

About Bad Boy Entertainment:

In 1993, Sean “Puff Daddy” Combs, also known as Diddy, launched Bad Boy Records. Nobody could have
imagined the impact the label would have on pop culture. As a subsidiary of the larger Bad Boy
Entertainment, the label became best known for its signature sound of streetwise hip-hop soul and the
ghetto fabulousness that radiated like precious jewels from its very name. Bad Boy was designed for
those who aspired higher, but also wanted to party until the break of dawn. Puffy had seen life from
both sides of the class divide and, with his groove-heavy music, worked hard to merge the two. There is
no better visual embodiment of this merger than the groundbreaking videos that were in heavy rotation
on BET and MTV and now on YouTube.

The Bad Boy Entertainment channel is the official YouTube home of iconic music videos from Puff
Daddy, Craig Mack, Faith Evans, 112, Total, Mase, Yung Joc, Cassie, Danity Kane, and the rest of the Bad
Boy Family, and your destination for some of the biggest 90s and 00s hip-hop hits of all time like Craig
Mack’s “Flava In Your Ear (Remix)”, the Notorious B.I.G. tribute “I’ll Be Missing You” by Puff Daddy feat.
Faith Evans and 112, and Cassie – “Me & U”.

LYRICS
 
It’s beautiful it’s bittersweet
You’re like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories and black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you’ll come back to me

Now I’m not holding on
Not holding on
Not holding on
I’m just depressed that you’re gone
Not holding on 
Not holding on

Beautiful mistakes 
I make inside my head
She’s naked in my bed
And now we lie awake 
Making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn’t take em back
I’m in love with the past
And now we lie awake 
Making beautiful mistakes

Nah nah nah
In my head
Nah nah nah 
In my bed
Nah nah nah
Making beautiful mistakes 

It’s pitiful
I can’t believe how everyday gets worse for me 
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from looking soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they’re my reality 

Now I’m not holding on
Not holding on
Not holding on
I’m just depressed that you’re gone
Not holding on 
Not holding on

Beautiful mistakes 
I make inside my head
She’s naked in my bed
And now we lie awake 
Making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn’t take em back
I’m in love with the past
And now we lie awake 
Making beautiful mistakes

Nah nah nah
In my head
Nah nah nah 
In my bed
Nah nah nah
Making beautiful mistakes

You did me wrong cause I let you
Usually I like my situations beneficial
Doing something different
Got me looking stupid
The only way I’m coming back to you, is if you dream it
Lucid, Prove it
If you made a promise, then keep it
Why you wanna lie and then get mad, I don’t believe it
But really I was just doing fine without ya 
Looking fine, sippin’ wine, dancing on club couches  
Baby why you wanna lose me like you don’t need me
Like I don’t block you and you still try to reach me
How you figure out how to call from me from the TV
You runnin’ out of chances and this time I mean it (yeah)

Bet you miss my love, all in your bed
Now ya stressin’ out, pulling your hair
Smelling your pillows and wishin I was there 
Sliding down to shower wall looking sad
I know its hard to let go, I’m the best
Best you ever had and best you gonna get
If we break up I don’t wanna be friends, you’re toxic

Beautiful mistakes 
I make inside my head
She’s naked in my bed
And now we lie awake 
Making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn’t take em back
I’m in love with the past
And now we lie awake 
Making beautiful mistakes

Nah nah nah
In my head
Nah nah nah 
In my bed
Nah nah nah
Making beautiful mistakes 

Nah nah nah
In my head
Nah nah nah 
In my bed
Nah nah nah
Making beautiful mistakes 

Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah

Lyrics:
Just shoot for the stars if it feels right
And aim for my heart if you feel like it
Take me away and make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control so we waited
I put on a show now we're naked
You say I'm a kid my ego is big
I don't give a shit and it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
Baby it's hard when you feel like
You're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right, but when you're with me
I make you believe that I've got the key
Oh, so get in the car we can ride it
Wherever you want get inside it
And you want to steer, but I'm shifting gear
I'll take it from here oh yeah yeah and it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
You want to know how to make me smile
Take control, own me just for the night
But if I share my secret you're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
So watch and learn I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right
But if I share my secret you're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger

Lyrics:
Tengo el cuaderno repleto de cartas pa’ ti
De cosas que en aquel tiempo no supe decir
Tengo tu foto en la puerta pa’ verte al salir
Ya no hay espacio en el cel pa’ volverte a escribir

Siri, llámala y dile que, que vuelva
Sin ella la casa se ha vuelto una selva
Siri, llama y pregúntale ¿Dónde está?
Que recupere la virginidad haciendo el amor con la soledad

Estas cuatro paredes se ríen en mi cara,
la cama la tengo de adorno, no puedo dormir

Si la vida te pasa factura ¿dónde es que se paga?

Yo no sé que te hice porque te fuiste en silencio
¿Qué alarma tengo que poner pa’ despertar contigo?
Suplicando por las redes, soy el más viral

Nuestro apartamento tiene una apesta a agonía

¿De qué vale un techo si ya no es un hogar ?

Y llevo la computadora googleando sobre ti
Ahora vuelvo a pedir

Siri, llámala y dile que, que vuelva
Sin ella la casa se ha vuelto una selva
Siri, llama y pregúntale ¿Dónde está?
Que recupere la virginidad haciendo el amor con la soledad

Antes de quedar bloqueado, permíteme un beso, un último adiós
Pero si te molesta mi voz, tengo una mensajera

Siri, llámala y dile que, que vuelva
Sin ella la casa se ha vuelto una selva
Siri, llama y pregúntale ¿Dónde está?
Que recupere la virginidad haciendo el amor con la soledad

Letras:

Delirante, obsesionado 
Con cerebro imaginario
Y dosis de locura
Veo cosas absurdas
Guárdame el secreto
En mi hombro hay un diablito que me agobia
Me impulsó a mandarte flores
Que te llame por las noches
Y que viole las reglas
Aunque seas ajena
Que no se me ocurra aceptarte ni un segundo
Como amiga
Necio porque tienes dueño
Y yo soy un loco 
Hablando con reflejos que no estan
Necio porque no eres mía
Mi fruta prohibida
Me despierta el deseo de probar
Sencillamente usted amada mía
Me pone necio
Es irracional este sentimiento
Que no detengo
Me va consumiendo
Sencillamente usted amada mía
Me vuelve necio
Mi amor alucinante se lanzó
Al océano por terco 
Y me estoy hundiendo
Oye que feeling, mami
Un amor sin disciplina
Calibrado e impaciente
Y vaga por tus calles
Como un imprudente
Viendo cada paso que tú des
Sin un motivo
Amada mía
Necio porque tienes dueño
Y yo soy un loco 
Hablando con reflejos que no estan
Necio porque no eres mía
Mi fruta prohibida
Me despierta el deseo de probar
Sencillamente usted amada mía
Me pone necio
Es irracional este sentimiento
Que no detengo
Me va consumiendo
Sencillamente usted amada mía
Me vuelve necio
Mi amor alucinante se lanzó
Al océano por terco 
Y me estoy hundiendo
Let's go
They wanna' know me
Santana
So nasty
Okay
Sencillamente usted amada mía
Me pone necio
Es irracional este sentimiento
Que no detengo
Me va consumiendo
Sencillamente usted amada mía
Me vuelve necio
Mi amor alucinante se lanzó
Al océano por terco 
Y me estoy hundiendo

Lyrics: 

MI CANTAR
MI CANTO ES UN LAMENTO
AY PORQUE ESTOY ENAMORA Y NO SOY CORRESPONDIDA
DESTROZA ESTOY POR DENTRO

Un cigarrillo me acompaña al abismo
Igual que tú, no tengo suerte en el amor
Amar a ciegas te quita poder
Pone en riesgo al corazón, dañando sentimientos
 
UN LUNES SE MARCHÓ
A LAS 6:24, YO DORMIDA
DE MI NO SE DESPIDIÓ
Y HOY DERRAMO CADA LÁGRIMA EN TU PECHO
NO ERES ÉL, PERO QUIERO UN BESO
 
Te incito
Aliviarnos las penas y curarnos en la cama
 
TE ADMITO
BABY SI HACES QUE LO OLVIDE
PUEDA QUE VUELVA MAÑANA
 
Te aseguro mami, seré el pañuelo
Mata la angustia aquí en mi cuerpo
 
PAPI DAME UN CONSUELO
SI ERES LA CURA QUIERO TU CUERPO
 
NO HUBO UN MENSAJE NI HUBO UNA NOTA EN LA MESA
ESE CABRÓN SOLO DEJÓ SU POLOCHE
AMAR A CIEGAS TE QUITA PODER
PERO ESTA NOCHE NOS ELEVAMOS PA EL CIELO
 
Te incito
Aliviarnos las penas y curarnos en la cama
 
TE ADMITO, BABY
SI HACES QUE LO OLVIDE
PUEDA QUE VUELVA MAÑANA
 
Te aseguro, mami seré el pañuelo
Mata la angustia aquí en mi cuerpo
 
PAPI, DAME UN CONSUELO
SI ERES LA CURA QUIERO TU CUERPO
 
ES EVIDENTE QUE PASAMOS POR LO MISMO
PERO NADIE HA MORIO POR AMOR
 
Esta noche
Ven, refúgiate en mis brazos
Desquítate con rabia pasional,
 
NO ES CASUAL QUE NOS HAYAMOS ENCONTRAO
 
Te incito
Aliviarnos las penas y curarnos en la cama
 
TE ADMITO BABY
SI HACES QUE LO OLVIDE
PUEDA QUE VUELVA MAÑANA
 
Te aseguro mami
Seré el pañuelo
Mata la angustia aquí en mi cuerpo
 
PAPI, DAME UN CONSUELO
SI ERES LA CURA QUIERO TU CUERPO

Lyrics:
 
Usted la hace feliz hasta cuando esta durmiendo
Conmigo su sonrisa salía de vacaciones
No sienta que lo envidio
Tiene un gran admirador
Le estoy hablando la verdad
A ella fue que le mentí cuando le susurraba que siempre sería mía
Y está de la chingada equivocarse por completo
Le quitaba el vestido 60 veces al mes
Yo era igualito a usted cuando la conquisté
Que hasta yo mismo me extraño
 
Hoy te agradezco por cambiar esa ternura que te funcionó al comienzo
Qué buena movida
Porque todos tus defectos hacen que luzca perfecto
Hoy te agradezco
Yo me convertí en su cielo al escaparse de tu infierno
Parece mentira que descongelé sus labios de lo frío que eran tus besos
Reconozco el daño
Antes yo era como tú
Y por eso es que me extraño
 
Ni mi arrogancia ni el ego me impiden entender que en mis manos la flor más hermosa fácilmente se echa a perder
 
Tus errores no fueron en vano
Brindemos, yo Invito a los tragos
Salud por lo que has descuidado
Por ti es que la tengo a mi lado
 
Me toca aplaudir que sea tuya aunque cueste creerlo
Hoy te agradezco
Por cambiar esa ternura que te funcionó al comienzo
Qué buena movida por que todos tus defectos hacen que luzca perfecto
 
Hoy te agradezco
Yo me convertí en su cielo al escaparse de tu infierno
Parece mentira que descongelé sus labios de lo frío que eran tus besos
Reconozco el daño
Antes yo era como tú
Por eso es que me extraño

Lyrics:
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

Sure it's Christmas once more...",True,True,804313933.0,jazz

Have a holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year
Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year

""Feeling Good"" Lyrics:
Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
River running free
You know how I feel
Blossom on a tree
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good

Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies all havin' fun you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done
That's what I mean
And this old world is a new world
And a bold world
For me

For me

Stars when you shine
You know how I feel
Scent of the pine
You know how I feel
Oh freedom is mine
And I know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
It's a new life
For me

And I'm feeling good

I'm feeling good
I feel so good
I feel so good

Official Lyrics:
When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance, you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway, I go weak
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway, I go weak
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me
When marimbas start to play
Hold me close, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

LYRICS:
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
He's checking it twice;
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Cause Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
And he knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming
I mean a big fat man with a long white beard
He's coming to town

""Home"" Lyrics:
Another summer day
Has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome
But I wanna go home, mmm

May be surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel all alone
I just wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

And I've been keeping all the letters
That I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
I'm fine baby, how are you?

Well I would send them but I know
That it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that

Another aeroplane
Another sunny place
I'm lucky I know
But I wanna go home
Mmm, I got to go home
 
Let me go home
I'm just too far
From where you are
I wanna come home

And I feel just like
I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right

And I know just why you could not
Come along with me
That this was not your dream
But you always believed in me

Another winter day
Has come and gone away
In even Paris and Rome
And I wanna go home
Let me go home

And I'm surrounded by
A million people I
I still feel alone
Oh, let me go home
Oh, I miss you, you know
 
Let me go home
I've had my run
Baby, I'm done
I gotta go home

Let me go home
It'll all be all right
I'll be home tonight
I'm coming back home

""Everything"" Lyrics:
You're a falling star, you're the get away car.
You're the line in the sand when I go too far.
You're the swimming pool, on an August day.
And you're the perfect thing to say.

And you play it coy but it's kinda cute.
Ah, when you smile at me you know exactly what you do.
Baby don't pretend that you don't know it's true.
'cause you can see it when I look at you.

[Chorus:]
And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times
It's you, it's you, you make me sing.
You're every line, you're every word, you're everything.

You're a carousel, you're a wishing well,
And you light me up, when you ring my bell.
You're a mystery, you're from outer space,
You're every minute of my everyday.

And I can't believe, uh that I'm your man,
And I get to kiss you baby just because I can.
Whatever comes our way, ah we'll see it through,
And you know that's what our love can do.

[Chorus]

So, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
So, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Chorus:]
And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times
It's you, it's you, you make me sing.
You're every line, you're every word, you're everything.
You're every song, and I sing along.
'Cause you're my everything.
Yeah, yeah

So, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
So, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

""Haven't Met You Yet"" Lyrics:

I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up then I let myself down

I tried so very hard not to loose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought, I thought of every possibility

And I know some day that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid that I give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timin and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come outta nowhere and into my life

And I know that we can be so amazin
And baby your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility

Somehow I know that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you kid I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

They say all's fair in love and war
But I won't need to fight it
We'll get it right and we'll be united

And I know that we can be so amazin
And bein in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility

And someday I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work to work it out
Promise you kid I'll give more than I get

Oh you know it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you kid to give so much more than I get yeah
I just haven't met you yet

I just haven't met you yet
Oh promise you kid to give so much more than I get
I said love love love love love love love
I just haven't met you yet

Lyrics:
I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents by the tree
Christmas eve will find you
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have some snow and mistletoe
And presents by the tree
Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Letra:
[Intro: Yandel]
(Eh-eh)
Ella es la que me encanta
Ella es la que me levanta cuando estoy jodío' (Eh)
Nunca se va del lado mío (Mío; eh-eh)

[Coro: Yandel]
Pero ella me cela por to' (Oh), me jode por to' (Oh)
Pelea por to', por to'
A vece' ni la soporto, pero en el cuarto
Nos damo' con to' y arreglamo' to'
Pero ella me cela por to' (Por to'), me jode por to' (Por to')
Pelea por to', por to'
A vece' ni la soporto, pero en el cuarto
Nos damo' con to' y arreglamo' to', oh

[Verso 1: Yandel]
Y aunque a vece' mal me porto
Ella me espera en la casa en vestidito corto
Trépate en mi cama pronto
Y quítate to' que quiero recorrer tu cuerpo
Por ti soy loco, se ve en mis ojos cuando te toco
Tú dime, ma'
Esto yo no lo hago con ninguna má', ah-ah
Yo te conocí perreando, recuérdate
Cuando los do' éramo' chamaco' de 16
Sonando Yandel
Tú bailándome, yo besándote
Más nunca te solté

[Coro: Yandel & Bad Bunny]
Pero ella me cela por to' (To'), me jode por to' (To')
Pelea por to', por to'
A veces ni la soporto, pero en el cuarto
Nos damos con to' y arreglamo' to', oh (Ey, ey)

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny]
Yo la conocí bailando, perreando Rakatá, eh-eh
Bien suelta, desacatá'
Me miró y le dije: ""Échate pa' acá""
Me dijo: ""Papi, vente tú"", y me fui por detrá', tra
Ya son años, no son mese' (Eh)
Ya hemo' chingao' más de mil vece'
Y todavía hace que se me erice la piel (Eh)
Le gusta que le hable con las mano' como Eliel (Huh)
Yo quisiera que to'a las luna' fueran de miel (Eh)
Pero hoy me estás peleando desde ayer
Yo me porto bien, yo soy tu perro fiel, ey, ey
Ella es la que está conmigo a pesar de mis desbalance' psicológico'
La que está conmigo sin importar lo económico
La que se ríe de mis chiste' aunque no sea cómico
La única que saca mi lado romántico
Con ella me caso aunque no sea por lo católico
Si lo nuestro va má' allá de un acto simbólico
Tú ere' una estrella, mami y yo soy tu fanático
Ese booty en cuatro y to'a las poses se ve exótico, ey

[Puente: Bad Bunny]
Y yo lo quiero encima de mí
No me pelee', mami, no sea' así
Tú sabe' que soy tuyo, que yo cambié por ti
Pero tú me cela' por to, me jode' por to'
Pelea' por to', por to'
A vece' ni te soporto
Pero en el cuarto nos hacemo' de to', oh

[Coro: Yandel]
Es que ella me cela por to' (Eh), me jode por to' (Oh)
Pelea por to', por to'
A vece' ni la soporto, pero en el cuarto
Nos damo' con to' y arreglamo' to'
Pero ella me cela por to' (Por to'), me jode por to' (Por to')
Pelea por to', por to'
A vece' ni la soporto, pero en el cuarto
Nos damo' con to' y arreglamo' to', oh (Uh-uh-uh)

Lyrics:

Ya yo ni se pa’ que te llamo mi amor
Si tu no sientes lo mismo que yo
Te dejaste ganar por tu orgullo
Otra se va a  comer lo que era tuyo
Ayer te vieron en la discoteca
Seguías con mi pulsera en tu muñeca
Esa sonrisa en tu foto de feca

Solo te pones pa mi
cuando te da la bellaquera
Un dia dices te extraño y al otro no texteas
No te pongas asi
Que ese flow no te queda
Bebe si yo a ti te quiero y tu haces conmigo lo que quieras

Esto esta carbón tu pichaera me afecta
Me tiene escuchando canciones de la secta
Extraño ese cuerpito y la ?  en tus tetas
Mas HP que yo tu no respetas

Te gusta mi piquete te gusta que se callen
Ya tu sabes lo que hago mas extremo en detalle
Chingaba rico
Yo nunca te fallé
Pero te fuiste como James del valle

Es que lo hacíamos demasiao’
De ese toto me quede enviciao’
Ahora miro los videos y las fotos e nosotros y termino encabronao’
Por que
Porque  lo hacíamos demasiao’
Ese toto me dejó enviciao’
Ahora miro los videos y las fotos e nosotros y eso me pone down

Solo te pones pa mi
cuando te da la bellaquera
Un día dices te extraño y al otro no texteas
No te pongas asi
Que ese flow no te queda
Bebe si yo a ti te quiero y tu haces conmigo lo que quieras
Tu haces conmigo lo que te dé la gana
Siempre peleas cuando me llamas
Sabes como manipularme no voy a dejarme
cuando me llama voy a llegarle oaaa
Me espera sin ropa
Tu eres droga no se quitarme ni manejarme
Y aunque hagas daño tengo que curarme oaa
Aunque me encantaría verte otra vez
Para volver a comernos igual que ayer
Solo te dejo saber
Que ya yo me canse de estar llamándote
Eo Eo  


Solo te pones pa mi
cuando te da la bellaquera
Un día dices te extraño y al otro no texteas
No te pongas asi
Que ese flow no te queda
Bebe si yo a ti te quiero y tu haces conmigo lo que quieras (X2)
