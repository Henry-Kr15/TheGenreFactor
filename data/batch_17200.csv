Lyrics:
If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heart beat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer
You're taken over the beat of my body, you just don't let up, don't let up
You're taken over the beat of my body but you lift me up, lift me up
If you take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer

LYRICS
I been up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
All night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
Sometimes I tend to lose myself when I'm out here on my own
I never seem to get it right, but I guess that's how it goes
Ever since you came around, can't nobody hold me down
You showed me how to find myself when I needed it the most
I been up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
All night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
Wide awake, that's okay, as long as I'm with you
I'll be up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
I'm never gonna find my way
If I don't learn to let go
The past is the past, today is today
And there's things I can't control
The circles underneath my eyes
Tell the truth that I've been trying to hide
I've been waiting for you way too long
Won't you come and take me home
Oh I, I'm praying this ain't all a dream
Can you, you, wake me up before you leave
I been up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
All night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
Wide awake, that's okay, as long as I'm with you
I'll be up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
Whoa, as long as I'm with you
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming

►Official “I Like You (A Happier Song) (with Doja Cat)” Lyrics:

Oh girl I like you,
I do
I wanna be your friend go shoppin' in the Benz
I like you
I do
I’ll hit you when I land, can you fit me in your plans
I like you
I do
We went to bed in France, then we woke up in Japan
I like you
I do, I do
 
Oh girl I know you only like it fancy
So I pull up in that Maybach Candy
Yea your boyfriend’ll never understand me
Cuz I’m bout to pull his girl like a hammy, hammy
 
Lets take a lil’ dip lil’ lady
Hit PCH 180
Yeah I’ve been thinkin’ lately
That I need someone to save me
 
Now that I'm famous I've got hoes all around me, but
I need a good girl, I need someone to ground me, so
Please be true don't fuck around on me
I need someone to share this heart with me
Fill you up then run it back again
 
Oh girl I like you,
I do
I wanna be your friend go shoppin' in the Benz
I like you
I do
I’ll hit you when I land, can you fit me in your plans
I like you
I do
We went to bed in France, then we woke up in Japan
I like you
I do, I do
 
Let me know when you free 
Cuz I been tryna hit it all week babe
Why you acting all sweet
I know that you want lil ol me
I get a little OD
But ain't shit new to a freak
Let me drop bands put a jewel in ya teeth
He love the way I drip turn the pool to a beach And i coulda copped a Birkin but I cop Celine
Why we got the same taste for the finer things
Brand new n***a with the same old team
Now he got me on a leash cuz he said no strings
You know I'm cool with that
Stole the pussy you ain't get sued for that
Wonder what a n***a might do for that
I could be your Chaka where Rufus at
80 in the Benz when the roof go back
They don't want to see us get too attached
I just gotta feeling that we might be friends for a long long time
You don’t mind and you know I like you for that  
 
Oh girl I like you,
I do
I wanna be your friend go shoppin' in the Benz
I like you
I do
I’ll hit you when I land, can you fit me in your plans
I like you
I do
We went to bed in France, then we woke up in Japan
I like you
I do, I do
 
I just want you, I just want you
Your heart’s so big but that ass is huge
Just want you, oh baby do
You like me too, ooh, ooh
 
Girl I like you,
I do
I wanna be your friend go shoppin' in the Benz
I like you
I do, I do

🎤 Lyrics: Doja Cat - Wine Pon You  ft. Konshen

[Doja Cat:]
I ain't got my eye on you
Ain't been hypnotized by you, yeah
Ain't in here tryna find my dude
I take it you just like the way I wine pon you

How I wine pon you
The way I wine pon you
How I wine pon you
The way I wine pon you, yeah
Take it you just like the way I wine pon you
Take it you just like the way I wine pon you, yeah

[TROY NōKA:]
You can catch her in the Vogue or Hustler magazine
Young red bitch, pussy wet, five screens
You can catch her in the Vogue or Hustler magazine
Young red bitch, pussy wet, five screens

[Doja Cat:]
Yeah, yeah
Pop that like Ginkgo biloba
That booty don't need no more soda
Too hot, now this boy don't need no more doja
Leg on the seat, that's a photo
See that you focused
If there's no room, boy, we squeeze in the corner
Way that he talking, you think that he know her
Hold up
See baby, this for the night, I won't see you tomorrow
Yeah, but when I dance here, boy you better man up
Be like a museum, got you looking, boy you can't touch
Yeah, I got him speaking, got him geeking, tie them hands up
Tappin to the beat, you wanna freak her 'cause she random
Know you got your girl here, looking for your ass, run
Faking that you loyal, boy, you playing with her passion
Even when the beat slow, I shake a lil' faster
Twerking on the speaker, know you need her in your fan club

How I wine pon you
The way I wine pon you
How I wine pon you
The way I wine pon you, yeah
Take it you just like the way I wine pon you
Take it you just like the way I wine pon you, yeah

[TROY NōKA:]
You can catch her in the Vogue or Hustler magazine
Young red bitch, pussy wet, five screens
You can catch her in the Vogue or Hustler magazine
Young red bitch, pussy wet, five screens

[Konshens:]
Aha, oh yeah
Baby girl, badman a wuk you, we no nerdy
Make underwear fly like birdie
When me call, you cum early
Make you wanna get down and dirty
When you whine up your body so slow
Punch line, solo
It's your show, be the star and done
When you back it pon me, me nah back down

[Doja Cat:]
How I wine pon you
The way I wine pon you
How I wine pon you
The way I wine pon you, yeah
Take it you just like the way I wine pon you
Take it you just like the way I wine pon you, yeah

Spend time roaming ‘Planet Her’ and you’ll know that Doja Cat’s artistic vision never sleeps. The singer’s desire to develop rich musical and visual environments for her fans is job one, and this new album, her third after ‘Amala’ and ‘Hot Pink,’ is her most fully-realized statement yet. Doja has told interviewers that she wanted to take chances, try new approaches, and create “otherworldly” sounds. Job done. The same goes for these new Official Live Performances. After meeting with the singer and her creative team, our production crew got to work in a canyon outside of LA. There, assuring that “otherworldly” request was appropriately fleshed out, we built a 48’ stage in the center of a rocky crag. Doja, banking on a combo of skills, artistry, and perseverance, did the rest. “Ain’t Shit” finds her chastising those who don’t live up to her standards, indictments leveled with some dreamy grooves behind them. Watch her prowl the stage. She’s as comfy in a Cali desert as she was in that giant saucer of milk she glided through in our “Streets” LIFT performance last year. Emotional candor and artistic command is everywhere in “Ain’t Shit.” Stay close to the Vevo social accounts. There’s more on the way.

[Chorus]
Yeah, it do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster

[Verse 1]
Money so old, dollars spoiled (Spoiled)
Yeah, my lil' bitch so spoiled (Spoiled)
Yeah, I rub her down in oil
Yeah, I got money, now you know it, yeah
Diamonds on my teeth
Yeah, your shit look like foil
Yeah, Chris Brown said these hoes ain't loyal, yeah
None of these hoes got no morals, yeah
All my niggas G-ed up
Yeah, my glasses be Dita
Never thought it would be days I could kick my feet up (Huh)
Never thought that she would need me that much if I leave her

[Chorus]
It do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster

[Verse 2]
All of this was faction
No time for actin', all this money lastin'
Like, go out to eat, get that blackened salmon
When I'm wit' my girl, we Pharrell and Vashtie
Wait, huh? That mean we are not lastin'
In that pussy, you know I like it rough, then I'm just blastin'
Yeah, tell that lil' bitch that I'm really from Mars
Uh, yeah, bitch, do not start
Yeah, pull up, my car automatic
Yeah, uh, done with the start, yeah

[Chorus]
It do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster

[VERSE I: Anthony Mars]
yo light that cigarette 
i'm tripping
ash it on my bitches
taking my dose
i never skip it
still in my hood up pistol gripping
still got 100 blunts
got that bape up in my cup
stay with a bitch in the cut who stay with my dick in her guts
wetto the king of the GREY
self park i don't fuck with valet
sheesh
private jet fuck a delay
went to paris and back in a day
okay
no i'm never okay
bitch stop asking
came up and supported my family
just for that they should give me a grammy
running and ducking the slammer
thinking bot cocking the hammer
the lights the glitter the glamour
none of this shit even matters
none of this shit made me happy
wound up in rehab instead of a casket
locking me up and they had the rooms padded
made a straight jacket my fashion



[VERSE II: Norman Atomic]
ruby that motherfucker
grim reaping
i'm undercover
soul seeking
i found another bitch who's thinking that i'm her lover
no
reason i keep on shrugging
blunt is cashed let's keep 'em coming
only weed keeps me from bugging and from seeking out more destruction
i'm a pro at self doubt but i doubt i'll ever know 
that these bitches want me to fly 'em out all because i upped the glow
all these fuckbois wanna be me but they keep it on the low
and talk shit about me and my cousin while we're thumbing through our dough
all this fame is such a curse sometimes i wish i was a ghost
watch me raise the fucking dead next time i'm on stage at a show



[OUTRO: Anthony Mars & Norman Atomic]
haunted, haunted
i can't escape my mind
it's like i'm doing time all the time
exhausted, lost it
just one little line
have this talk with god all the time",True,True,47876216.0,hip hop culture

[Verse I: Scrim]
I put hemis in my auto to speed up to my bardo
Da Vinci code my blood line

Ima grey stepper
Off the 8th letter
check my cardiac
More turnt than the Maury show when he say you are not the dad
G
Grey the gang stain a lame with the A
R
Relapsed off them bars before I nod I pop that
E
Enigma my stigmata baby momma hollering
Y
Young Christ baby I was sent here just to die

[Verse II: Germ]
praise the grey
G-R-E-Y
seize the day
no pain today
rollin’ dem blunts it’s a rollover crash
can’t see a thing
shit ain’t the same
Where the fire?
i could of caught a body
slimy highly likely crash the Masi
Oxys in my Yerba Mate diet
slidin’ flexin’ hopin’ they don’t find me
put up bitch better shut up
raptor truck pulled hopped out with the cutter
barber with me he ain’t on the clock
fades all day ima clean up the block
stickin’ and movin’ I do that a lot
rocks in my clock could’ve bought me a yacht
neck look like the ocean
I need a lifeguard on god

[Verse III: Ruby]
stand my fucking ground
lil shawty tryna fuck me up
spinnin round and round
my head feel like tires on a bus
no fuck boys allowed
grey 59 is an exclusive club
it looks like i drowned
all these diamonds got quality cut
ruby such a mystery
dodging all these inquiries
blame my dope addiction all on made up abstract injuries

Lyrics:
Somebody hand me a cigarette
I know I ain't had one in over a week
Somebody pour me a double shot
Been getting better by the day but tonight I drink 
You say I gotta get over you
And get sober too
I got a lot of habits I gotta kick 
But weigh out all your options
And take your pick

I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone 
I can give you up right now
Never want you back long as I’m half stoned
If you want me to quit you
Want me to get you out of my heart and baby off my mind
I hate to tell ya girl 
But I’m only quitting one thing at a time
Aw yeah I hate to tell you
Aw yeah I hate to tell you

I know I got me some problems
About a thousand memories I gotta forget
But if I'm gonna solve ‘em
Baby I’ll take all the help I can get 
If you ain’t gonna kiss me
Then I'll take some whiskey
Some grizzly
Nicotine amphetamines too 
You want me to stop some of that 
Or you want me to stop loving you 
Hey whatchu want me to do

I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone 
I can give you up right now
Never want you back long as I’m half stoned
If you want me to quit you
Want me to get you out of my heart and baby off my mind
I hate to tell ya girl 
But I’m only quitting one thing at a time
Aw yeah I hate to tell you
Aw yeah I hate to tell you

I ain't no superman
I’m just the way I am
If I’m gonna move on 
Then I need me something in my hand 
Ain't nothing wrong with that
If you ain’t coming back 

I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone 
I can give you up right now
Never want you back long as I’m half stoned
If you want me to quit you
Want me to get you out of my heart and baby off my mind

Lyrics: 
They beat us every damn year
It’s been a minute since we pulled out a win
I loaded the truck down with beer
Drove down to watch ‘em do it again
And they did so we went to the bar right after
Met a girl with a houndstooth print of her chapter
On her shirt and it turned into talking all night
She came back with me cross the Vol state line
 
Guess the jokes on Alabama ‘cause they lost big this time
I got the number one pick blonde hair red lips
Brought her over to the other side
A little deep south Delta Gamma
Done found a Smoky mountain man
She was raised roll tide till the day she died
But ever since that night she’s been a Tennessee fan
 
She likes riding on them winding roads
The smell of sweet pine in the air
I took her about as high as you could go, ha
You can still see Tuscaloosa from there
And all the girls back home say how could you love him
All them boys probably hate me for taking her from ‘em
Lord knows her mom and daddy’s jaw would drop
If they heard her singing every word of Rocky Top

Guess the jokes on Alabama ‘cause they lost big this time
I got the number one pick blonde hair red lips
Brought her over to the other side
A little deep south Delta Gamma
Done found a Smoky mountain man
She was raised roll tide till the day she died
But ever since that night she’s been a Tennessee fan
 
Oh
Yeah it’s alright let’s just call it even 
‘Cause she’s all mine
And she ain’t ever leaving
And she’s damn fine in orange every weekend
From now on
Yeah she found home
 
Looks like the jokes on Alabama ‘cause they lost big this time
I got the number one pick blonde hair red lips
Brought her over to the other side
A little deep south Delta Gamma
Done found a Smoky mountain man
She was raised roll tide till the day she died
But ever since that night she’s been a Tennessee fan
Oh she’s been a Tennessee fan",False,True,21084143.0,country music

- Qvliy

Lil Peep is someone who left this world way too soon. I enjoy the emo vibe he gave to rap and the unique kind of person he was. I made this video because it was what first got me listening to him. An official music video was never released for this song but I hope you guys enjoy my take on how I visualized this song. 



- Late into the night on November 15, 2017, Lil Peep passed away due to a suspected overdose of Xanax that had been laced with the dangerous drug fentanyl. He was 21.

Big Shoutout to Wiggy as most of the clips are from him: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfVC...

[Verse 1: rainy bear]
I can see it in your eyes, that you wanna get out
I can see it in your eyes, that you need it right now
That you need it right now
That you wanna get out
That you need it right now
That you wanna get out

[Chorus: rainy bear & Lil Peep]
Yeah, I just wanna hear the sound
Drive our Camaros out of town
Baby, we could leave right now, woah
Yeah, I just wanna feel alive
Baby, take your time
Smokin' on this loud, woah

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Girl, you know you make my cold heart warm with a touch
One kiss, then we fuckin', I just can't get enough
Put it on me, that's the best part, baby, the trust
Trust me, I got nothin' for you other than love
I remember eatin' pussy on the back of the bus
I remember gettin' nookie 'til the Sun came up
All the places that you took me, no one came with us
Same hoes overlook me, now they on my nuts",False,True,126878654.0,hard rock

[Verse 1: Lil Tracy]
In high school, I was a loner
I was a reject, I was a poser
Multiple personalities, I'm bipolar
I swear, I mean well, I'm still goin' to hell
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die, bury me with all my ice on
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die, bury me with all my ice on
[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
When I die, bury me with all my ice on
When I die, bury me without the lights on
Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white
When I die, bury me with all my ice on
When I die, bury me without the lights on
Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white

[Verse 3: Lil Tracy]
Clothes off, baby, I got good white
Tell me a secret and I'll tell one of mines
I just wanna talk, I don't wanna fight
Ask me if I'm alright, do you want me to lie?

LIZA’S NOTES:

Gus wrote this song in early 2015.  He and a friend shot some footage at our home in Long Beach, NY—where a couple of his other videos were shot. Gus liked shooting in the basement, and in the garage. He liked playing with atmosphere.  In this one, he was playing with light and shadow.  He was also very proud of his new glasses.  He needed prescription glasses, and this was the only pair he ever had with a prescription in them.

Lyrics:
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la, yeah

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la la la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't you let me fall

Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you
All along I've been coming for you
And I hope it meant something to you
Call my name, I'll be coming for you
Coming for you, coming for you, coming for you

For you (ooh, she loves it when I come)
For you

Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you

Lyrics:
You never know how good you have it 
Ohh, ohhh
Until you’re staring at a picture of the only girl that matters
Huhhh uh 
I know what we’re supposed to do 
It’s hard for me to let go of you
so I’m just trying to hold on
 
Hold on, I don’t wanna know what it’s like when you’re gone
I don’t wanna move on
I don’t wanna know what it’s like when you’re gone for good
You’re slipping through my fingertips
A little bit by a little bit
I didn’t know that loving you was the happiest I’ve ever been 
So I’m just trying to hold on
 
I need to learn how to cope without you
I’m trying to pretend myself but I don't really know how to 
Yeah ohh I know what we’re supposed to do
Ohh but I hate the thought of losing you
So I’m just trying to hold on 
 
Hold on, I don’t wanna know what it’s like when you’re gone 
I don’t wanna move on
I don’t wanna know what it’s like when you’re gone for good
You’re slipping through my fingertips
A little bit by a little bit
I didn’t know that loving you was the happiest I’ve ever been 
So I’m just trying to hold on 
 
Starting to feel like you don’t need me 
Wanna believe it’s all for the better
It’s getting real
I’m missing you deeply 
So I’m just trying to hold on 
Starting to feel like you don’t need me 
Wanna believe it’s all for the better
It’s getting real
I’m missing you deeply
So I’m just trying to hold on 
 
Hold on, I don’t wanna know what it’s like when you’re gone 
I don’t wanna move on
I don’t wanna know what it’s like when you’re gone for good
You’re slipping through my fingertips
A little bit by a little bit
I didn’t know that loving you was the happiest I’ve ever been 
So I’m just trying to hold on 
I’m just trying to move on

Chorus:
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

Chorus: 
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain’t seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

Lyrics:
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

🎤 Lyrics: Luke Combs - Better Together

[Verse 1]
A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut corn fields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this old guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pouring your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

[Verse 2]
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this old guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pouring your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

[Bridge]
Sometimes we're oil and water, but I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest, your first and my last name

[Chorus]
Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this old guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pouring your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
And me, as long as you're right here

Lyrics:
I’m one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

Lyrics / Letra

Una noche que no puedo olvidar 
Y aunque tenga que escaparse 
Y al trabajo tarde llegar 
Y pichar todos los textos 
Y el celu apagar 

Y yo la conozco le gustan los carros las motos 
La mota mezcla con lo otro 
Y a veces le gustan los totos

No la mire que ella está en la de ella 
Pídele otra botella que 
Eso es lo que quiere ella 
Eso es lo que quiere ella
No la mire que ella está en la de ella 
Pídele otra botella que 
Eso es lo que quiere ella 
Eso es lo que quiere ella

Si la ves no le digas na 
No, que ella no vino a portarse bien 
Trajo a su amiga y va a besársela 
Después del party va pal after 
Sentimiento en el freezer 
No es regular esa bebesita es disel 
Me agarra este tubo como una stripper 
Y yo le abro ese garaje como si tuviera un beeper 
Y que fue que va a hacer 
Que paso dime a ver 
Pongo la cara en esas tetas y parece que tienes tres 
Cuerpecito se ve que tomas te 
De medallo yo le dije vea pues 
Tu cuerpo a mi me provoca 
Quiero que te quites la ropa 
Quiero comerte completota
Las nagas las tienes grandota
Tu cuerpo a mi me provoca 
Quiero que te quites la ropa
A la competencia la tiene rota 

No la mire que ella está en la de ella 
Pídele otra botella que 
Eso es lo que quiere ella 
Eso es lo que quiere ella
No la mire que ella está en la de ella 
Pídele otra botella que 
Eso es lo que quiere ella 
Eso es lo que quiere ella

Dicen que alcohol no arregla na tu toma 
El agua tampoco arregla na 
Ella es lo que quiere es jangueo 
Hasta que nos boten los feos 
Y hace tiempo 
Yo te tengo Boom boom en la mira blam blam 
Tu me dices para donde es que van y yo le llego 
Dime cual es el plan que no estamos para pasarla mal 
Dale no seas tímida rompe 
Con eso que tu invertiste tu mataste a la compe 
De money tag asi que dejen el fronte 
Está en la de ella así que soportenla

Yo te tengo boom boom en la mira blam blam
Tu me dices pa donde es que van y yo le llego 
Dime cual es el plan que no estamos pa pasarla mal

El abdomen lo tiene duro 
Blindaje se hizo el cora lleno de cicatrices 
Scarface yo me la llevo para lo oscuro 
Prendemos bareto del tamaño de un puro 
Su ex se quedo atrás como Napster 
Explota chavos en los puteros flow gangster 
Estilo caro el cuello forrao en diamantes
No sube un story si farrea con cantantes 
Ey rompe la calle y ve salir el sol 
El culo grande para mi que juega volleyball 
Es una pitcher janguea con las tornasol 
Si le metes presión ella le mete terror 

No la mire que ella está en la de ella 
Pídele otra botella que 
Eso es lo que quiere ella 
Eso es lo que quiere ella
No la mire que ella está en la de ella 
Pídele otra botella que 
Eso es lo que quiere ella 
Eso es lo que quiere ella

(Letra/Lyrics):
[Intro: Bad Bunny]
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-eh, ey, ey
Disfruto el poder verte aunque no sea conmigo (Oh-oh-oh), no, ey
Tengo que conformarme con ser solo tu amigo
Siempre pensando en tu nombre, vivo distraído
Por fin me enamoré y resulta que e' prohibido
Má' alante vive gente, pero no me he movido
Sigo estanca'o, siempre soñando contigo
El DM explota'o, pero las dejo еn leído
Mis letra' siemprе tienen tu nombre y apellido
Viviendo con mil pregunta', el lápi' sin punta
De todo lo que escribo, ma', tú tiene' la culpa
Llevo un año pagando la misma multa
Tú ere' ese mal que no sé por qué me gusta
El no poder olvidarte me frustra
Te lo juro que me frustra

[Coro: Sech & Mora]
Pero si me llamas le llego volando
En la Mercedes voy capsuleando
Y cuando no está', te sigo imaginando
Y sin ropa en mi cama, mi nombre gritando
Y si me llama' le llego volando
En la Mercede' voy capsuleando
Y cuando no está', te sigo imaginando
Sin ropa en mi cama, mi nombre gritando, oh

[Verso 1: Sech]
Voy volando aunque sufra de vértigo (Ey)
Y si me caigo no tengo un plan médico, oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Con tus senote' yo me siento en México (Ey)
Contigo el doctor me medicó, así que vente
Olvida el pasado, que el futuro lo tiene' de frente
No solo Bad tiene un ""X 100PRE""
Pero yo le llego, solo dime (Pero dime)
Que no me vaya
Cuéntame si tiro la toalla
O si la tiramos en la playa
Baby, voy volando por si la señal me falla (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Coro: Mora]
Y si me llama' le llego volando
En la Mercede' voy capsuleando
Y cuando no está', te sigo imaginando
Sin ropa en mi cama, mi nombre gritando, oh

[Verso 2: Mora]
Y si me llama' yo le caigo en el AMG
Baby, pa' terminar lo que a mitad dejé
En la cama hicimo' una serie, pero no PG
Y aunque me alejé
Sigo viendo tu cara cuando a otra se lo pongo
Si todavía tengo tu wallpaper de fondo
Ando sin salvavida' nadando en lo hondo
Yo siento tus latido' aunque me quede sordo

[Puente: Mora & Bad Bunny]
Y dime tú cómo e' que se sana este dolor
Si ya lavé las sábana', pero siguen con tu olor
Y yo solo pido sentir de nuevo tu calor
Ya probé una' cuanta', pero extraño tu sabor (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, ey)

[Verso 3: Bad Bunny]
Si tú me llama', yo le llego má' rápido que Emergencia'
Pa' ti no hay competencia
Cuando tú llega' se siente la diferencia
¿Será una maldición o coincidencia?
Con ese culote y esa carita
Tú ere' la mami favorita
Si estuviésemo' en kínder te enviaba cartita'
Llevo to' el día en la playa pa' ver si se me quita
La' estrella' te ven y piden un deseo
Baby, tú tiene' algo que yo solo veo
Ya no quiero más premio', no quiero más trofeo'
Yo lo único que pido e' mañana verte de nuevo, ey
Aunque sea con él
El cielo en el infierno, nadie va a entender
Huyendo 'e lo que siento, me cansé de correr
En mis ojo' se nota, no lo puedo esconder

[Coro: Bad Bunny]
Que si tú me llama' le llego volando
A la hora que tú diga', no importa dónde y cuándo
Y cuando no está' te sigo imaginando
Tu alma con la mía, las do' junta' vibrando, ey

Letra:

Tu quieres conmigo
Pero tu corazón tiene dueño
Eso ya no sirve llévalo a una casa de empeño
Y si no sabes olvidar, tranquila yo te enseño
Trato de no pensarte pero me sale hasta en los sueños

Yo te sigo la maquina, se que piensas en el pero ese cabrón
No merece tus lagrimas 
Solo déjate ver yo hago lo demás

Baby pasa la pagina
Ya tu no eres de el periódico de ayer
Dile que tiene a alguien mas
Que te lo hace mejor
Y no pelea por na

Baby yo estoy pa ti, pero dime tu
Si quieres que esto avance cámbiame la luz
La puerta del ataúd déjasela abierta
Que esa relación ya esta muerta

Dice que te quiere y mira su actitud
Baby tu rezando entre la multitud
Tu no eres común tu eres otra vuelta
Pura cosa rica mami estas compuesta

La noche se presta
No quiero indirecta
Yo quería amarrarte pero tu andas suelta
Y antes que te vayas mami pon la web cam
Quítate la ropa pa verte completa

Tu eres loca ma, pero yo soy igual
Ese cabrón te resta pero yo te voy a sumar
Porque tu eres cara como un Audemar
Con el fondo azul igualita al mar

Yo te sigo la maquina, se que piensas en el pero ese cabrón
No merece tus lagrimas 
Solo déjate ver yo hago lo demás

Baby pasa la pagina
Ya tu no eres de el periódico de ayer
Dile que tiene a alguien mas
Que te lo hace mejor
Y no pelea por na

Bebe tranquila no llores por el
Yo puedo ser tu paño
Pasamos de ser extraños
A tirar tres polvos en el mismo baño

Y sabes que si te toco se te forma un charco
Te compro el mundo entero yo vacío el banco
Te saco la G-wagon asientos en blanco
Quizá somos diferentes yo me adapto
Baby
No te des, mala vida de esa depresión yo soy la única salida
Cuando te lo pongo tu te sientes viva
Blockea ese cabrón pa que ni te escriba

Lyrics: 

Puedes decir que estás bien 
Que desde que yo no estoy 
Te la pasas más cabrón 
Dices que es mejor que yo 

Pero, ¿quién te preguntó?
¿Quién te preguntó?

No sé para quién ni para qué estás fingiendo 
Yo no estoy pendiente de lo que estás haciendo 
Eres solamente una memoria 
Ni siquiera miro tus historias 

Si fueras feliz como tú dices ma’
No estuviera presumiendo na’
A mí no me engañas 

Sé que te la pasas con él
De hotel en hotel 
Yo bajé un millón de estrellas 
Él te compró con cinco de ellas 
Ayer en su Panamera yo te vi 
Y tengo que admitir que te veías igual de bella 

Sé que te la pasas con él
De hotel en hotel 
Yo bajé un millón de estrellas 
Él te compró con cinco de ellas 
Ayer en su Panamera yo te vi 
Y tengo que admitir que te veías igual de bella 
Pero no feliz

Paso por aquí buscándote 
Pero noté si no para tomarme un té 
Y ya que sola te encontré no te pedí ni el flotador
Cuando en el alcohol yo estaba ahogándome 

El amor me tenía todo jodido 
Con toda la mierda que me he metido 
Fuiste como una casa alquilada 
Invertí en algo que nunca fue mío
Me convirtió en hielo todo tu frío
Me di junto a la piedra de ese río
Si con la caída uno aprende
Me caí y aunque quedé sin dientes sonrío
Estoy tan high, ya apaga el blunt
El waze abierto sin ubicación
Una hora con la misma cancion
Queriendo hacer el amor sin amor

Sé que te la pasas con él
De hotel en hotel 
Yo te bajé un millón de estrellas 
Él te compró con cinco de ellas 
Ayer en su Panamera yo te vi 
Y tengo que admitir que te veías igual de bella 

Sé que te la pasas con él
De hotel en hotel 
Yo te bajé un millón de estrellas 
Él te compró con cinco de ellas 
Ayer en su Panamera yo te vi 
Y tengo que admitir que te veías igual de bella 
Pero no feliz

LETRA

Bueno mi gente es todo por hoy,
Se acabò mi programación y las dejo aquí
Con DJ SECH

Nuevamente te habla tu DJ favorito, desde el bloke FM
Bienvenidos al Bloke

Álcenme la mano to’a esa baby
Que le pelean, si sube foto en panty 
Lo que está rico no se tapa
Pero si le das “like” a otra gata, ¿cómo e’?

Quiero ver perreando to’a esa’ baby
Que le pelean, si sube foto en panty
Tú también ‘ta rica y él te tapa
Pero si le das “like” a otra gata, ¿cómo e’?

Tú también ‘ta rica y eso yo lo veo
Hoy es noche de pistola y de malianteo
Con esa cinturita tú pareces un trofeo (ey)
Tú tienes un piquete pero feo
Oh, de romper la calle, se trata
Y quién carajo eres tú
Pa’ decirle qué hacer con su plata

Ella anda arrebatada, arrebatada
Anoche yo la vi, vi y ni le di, di
Bichote andan en el VIP-P
Todo estaban hablando de ti, ti (ti, ti)

Álcenme la mano to’a esa baby
Que le pelean, si sube foto en panty 
Lo que está rico no se tapa
Pero si le das “like” a otra gata, ¿cómo e’?

Quiero ver perreando to’a esa’ baby
Que le pelean, si sube foto en panty
Tú también ‘ta rica y el te tapa
Pero si le das “like” a otra gata, ¿cómo e’?

Arriba la mano como si este es un asalto
To’ el mundo perreando 
El volumen en alto
Tengo 7 en la espalda pero yo no soy Ronaldo
Yo vine sin hambre, pero a ti te harto
Le da “like” a la que está meno’ buena que tú
Pero subiste un foto, y él se mordió 
En un bikini bien rico, moviendo ese cu’ (Sech, tú eres un loco)

Flow dime
El bellaqueo sigue
Ayer chingué con una pero no me vine
Flow dime
El bellaqueo sigue
Aquí hay un bellaco, adivinen (presente)

Flow dime
El bellaqueo sigue
Bellaqueo, bellaqueo, bellaqueo sigue
Flow dime
El bellaqueo sigue
Aquí hay una bellaca, adivinen

Álcenme la mano to’a esa baby
Que le pelean, si sube foto en panty 
Lo que está rico no se tapa
Pero si le das “like” a otra gata, ¿cómo e’?

Quiero ver perreando to’a esa’ baby
Que le pelean, si sube foto en panty
Tú también ‘ta rica y él te tapa
Pero si le das “like” a otra gata, ¿cómo e’?

Álcenme la mano to’a la baby
Que no quieren que se acabe el party, 
Que se acabe el party (yeah)

Álcenme la mano to’a la baby
Que no quieren que se acabe el party, 
Que se acabe el party 
Ye, yo

Oye yo creo que voy a abrir una radio, un bar, una discoteca 
Mi amor, en verdad, yo vine aquí pa’ decirte que te sigas
Tomando tu fotos en panty, en bikini, en baby doll
En lo que a ti te guste, porque tu te ve’ tan hermosa, tan rica, y
Yo estoy soltero así que yo te doy bastante “like, like, like, like, like, like, like”
Me encantas

Ahora todo cambió, le toca a ella

Latino Gang

Ayer la vi perreando solita (Welcome to the Remix) 
Se ve má​s bonita
Ahora que no está con ese man
Que la felicidad como ropa se la quita

Que yo siempre estaba cuando tú no estabas 
Fue tanto dolor que ya no me mataba
Poco a poco ya no te necesitaba
Y yo sonreía mientras lo enrolaba

Y tú,
Diciendo que fue falta de actitud
Pero en esta relación hice más que tú, yeah
Y en un estado te mando a decir que ​(Da-ddy Yan-kee)

Ahora todo cambió, le toca a ella ​(Prrr) 
Mari y una botella​ (¿Qué, qué?) 
Gracias al maltrato se puso bella 
Ahora tú la quieres y no te quiere ella

Ahora todo cambió, le toca a ella 
Party y una botella
Gracias al maltrato se puso bella (​DDDY) 
Ahora tú la quieres y no te quiere ella

Ahora quiere que la graben ​(​ Prrr)
Vacilando y que se lo enseñen a él​ ​(Dile)
Ya no le gusta seguir patrones ella e’ la patrona 
Se te fue la princesita, búscate a Fiona

Por que
To’ lo fine’ de semana ‘ta de party en party 
Sigue matando las ganas con botella y mari 
Te dejaron un estado ahí, ahí, ahí
Dice “me sigue tirando y no caí, aí, aí”

Tú incumpliste el contrato, yo puse lo que faltaba
A ella le gusta el maltrato pero no el que tú le daba’ 
Le dicen la Apple, tiene su iPhone, su iPa’ perrear 
iPa’ beber, iPa’ fumar, iPa’ joder ​​(¿Qué?)

To’ lo fine’ de semana ‘ta de party en party
Sigue matando las ganas con botella y mari​ ​(Let’s go) 
Te dejaron un estado ahí, ahí, ahí
Dedicao’ pa’ ti decía así ​​(Welcome to the remix)

Tú te has creído que te iba a llorar ​(No)
Tú la llevas clara que te iba a esperar
Tú te pensaste que tú me tenías
Pero nunca me tuviste, soy La Rosalía ​(Mira)
Si llevo tantas cadenas no es pa’ que nadie me amarre ​(No) 
No dejo que nadie a mí el cora me desgarre
Tú estás jugando con una jugadora 
La que pisa fuerte, la matadora

Ahora todo cambió, le toca a ella 
Mari y una botella
Gracias al maltrato se puso bella 
Ahora tú la quieres y no te quiere ella

Y ahora todo cambió, le toca a ella ​(A ella) 
Mari y una botella
Gracias al maltrato se puso bella ​(Yeah) 
Ahora tú la quieres y no te quiere ella ​(No, no)

Todo empezó con el bloqueo de WhatsApp
Por más que tú la llames tampoco va a contestar 
Ahora ella anda solo de rumba y tú te derrumbas 
Lloras tú porque sus lágrimas no valoraste 
Hasta tu madre dice que no la cuidaste
Su corazón te odia por lo mal que la trataste
Y si te ve en la calle seguro te saca el de’o
La cogiste de pendeja, ahora tú eres su pendejo

Tú caiste muy bajo en la fiesta borracho
Te mereces en tu vida todos los cachos
Y ya sabemos que tú andas malherido ​(Lara mercy gang) 
En la vida to’ se paga porque fuiste un malparido

Ahora todo cambió, dió un giro 360
Se puso más rica y está puesta pa’ la vuelta
No quiere saber de ti, quemando pa’ la venta 
El Carajo brother, calma te paso la cuenta

Y ahora anda rulin rompiendo la calle
Se cansó y ya no quiere coro con nadie
Le cogió el gusto y ya no hay quien la pare
Y ahora está difícil de nuevo que la hale ​(Farru’)

Ahora ella quiere carretera
Y ahora más que ahora está soltera

Bebe y fuma la noche entera 
Y le da tremenda loquera 
Cuando coge la borrachera 
Le da con oir safaera
Y le entra la bellaquera
Pero no se la da a cualquiera ​(Priyayayaya) 
(Farru)

Ahora todo cambió, le toca a ella ​(Prrr) 
Mari y una botella​ (¿Qué, qué?) 
Gracias al maltrato se puso bella 
Ahora tú la quieres y no te quiere ella

Y ahora todo cambió, le toca a ella ​(¿Qué?) 
Hookah y una botella ​(DDDY)
Gracias al maltrato se puso bella
Ahora tú la quieres y no te quiere ella ​(Yeah)

Hola.

Quiero saber tu nombre y quizás, tal vez, algo podríamos tener.
No sé, si me pensaste como yo te pensé.
Fue que yo me acordé, que ayer, tú...

Dejaste en mi cama toda tu ropa interior.
Y hoy te estoy buscando pa’ pasarla cabrón. 
No sé lo que tiene, está dura la shorty, modela en su story. 

Ayer en la noche empezamos y la disco encendía y tu prendía. 
Anoche lo hicimos en el carro y hoy ni me conocía, qué rico lo hacías bebé.

Ayer en la noche empezamos y la disco prendía y tu encendía.
Anoche lo hicimos en el carro y hoy ni me conocía, qué rico lo hacías bebé

Nosotros haciéndolo atrás y los asientos pa’ lante, pegao al volante.
Besándome el cuello me dice que quiere que le ponga reggaeton de antes.
Triple X, yeah, cuando arriba la trepé.
Te tiene pensando cómo te azoté.
Tú me llamas.
Y le llego a tu casa Fedex.

Yo tengo una gata que me gusta es media masoquista y le gusta por detrás.
Conmigo siempre bebe, pero de vez en cuando a ella le gusta fumar.
Cuando le meto (duro) se me forma el capsulón hasta el techo.
Yo la quiero porque es un booty nuevo.
No necesito otra más, baby por eso (Zion, baby).

Ayer en la noche empezamos y la disco encendía y tu prendía.
Anoche lo hicimos en el carro y hoy ni me conocía, qué rico lo hacías bebé.

Ayer en la noche empezamos y la disco prendía y tu encendía.
Anoche lo hicimos en el carro y hoy ni me conocía, qué rico lo hacías bebé.

Eran las 12 y entre caricias y roces yo hice lo que quería solo para que tú goces. 
Soy tu esclavo, dime qué hago.
Pero por favor no digas que no me reconoces.
Porque fue mágico, comer tu cuerpo exótico.
Yo estaba enfermo, yo morí y tu fuistes mi antibiótico.
Te mordía los labios, tú decías dame.
Que te llevara al cielo y que el momento no acabe.

Shorty como te va, el perfume de tu cuerpo no se me va.
Los cristales empañados por la humedad.
Y los condones en la gaveta por si se da, si se da… da...
Tú eres adicta al perreo pero más al bellaqueo.
69 posiciones si nos vemos.
Tenemos un vicio que siempre los dos queremos.

Otra, otra noche, otra, llevo baretica pa’ prenderme. 
Otra, otra noche, otra, con ese culito me hooquie ya. 
Parce tiene que moverse, yo saque a pasear la chica en la Merce.
Bebé qué más pues, qué hay pa’ hacer esta tarde.
Pasé por el barrio antes de venir a verte.

Ayer en la noche empezamos y la disco encendía y tu prendía.
Anoche lo hicimos en el carro y hoy ni me conocía, qué rico lo hacías bebé.

Ayer en la noche empezamos y la disco encendía y tú ta’ prendía.
Ayer empezamos en el carro, hoy ni me conocías, qué rico lo hacías.

Ok, conocidos mundialmente como Los Vengadores.
The Avengers.

Y mientras tú estabas con él, baby, yo le daba a aquella
Vas a cien, ya mismo te estrellas
Y caminaste en el cuarto pero no dejaste huellas

Y (y), tengo un culo nuevo (culo nuevo)
En un Airbnb con ella me encuevo
Las babys se van en uber, yo nunca las llevo (nah)
A tí te compre de to’ así que na’ te debo
Tú tranquila, que ya yo te di
Me cogiste de pendejo pero yo también mentí
A to’ita tus amigas en bajita les metí
Si supieras to’ la mierda que ellas me hablaban de tí (yeah)

Mi cuerpo sigue en tu consciencia
Y cuando él te lo pone tú siente’ la diferencia
De modelos tengo una agencia
Si te duele, dale, arranca pa’ emergencia’

Tranquila, que esto se olvida
Pasa el tiempo y eso se olvida
Si ni siquiera dura la vida
Bendición, se me cuida

Decía que por mí se moría, ah

Otra mentira más

Yeah
Anoche soñé que me escribiste, eh
Cabrona, hasta el sueño me jodiste
Tu mai te dió a luz pero to’ lo oscureciste, eh
¿Dime por qué no te devolviste?

Le dije a Dios
“Librame del mal” y quedé soltero (soltero)
Si fueras la vida pues me muero, ey

LYRICS: 

one-two, one-two

I’m on
But you want me home
I’d get you what you want
But you want me alone (baby I’m active)
You held me up when I was down & out
But I don’t want you waiting round for me 
I don’t want you waiting too long 
I don’t want you waiting too long 

She hold me down like gravity 
we on front page of them blogs, 
would you be mad at me if the whole world knew the shit we was on? it would be tragedy 
My niggas be globe-trotting like travel teams 
you always In my travel dreams 
lace up two 3-stripes & I’m gone.
But you just want me home 
Shorty hit my jack like “what the fuck you doin?” bitch I’m all alone 
You gon’ press me now? 
Is you gon stress me out & cuss me out? 
I had my fair share of women, feelings don’t catch me now

I’m on (don’t act like I’m average)
But you want me home
I’d get you what you want (superstar status)
But you want me alone (baby I’m active)
You held me up when I was down & out
But I don’t want you waiting round for me 
I don’t want you waiting too long

It’s not that I’m over you (not over girl)
But I got things to do 
It’s too much to be your boyfriend (too much)
& you ain’t making this much easier 
If I only knew this 
When I used to be your best friend 
you see me blowing up 

I’m on (don’t act like I’m average)
But you want me home
I’d get you what you want (superstar status)
But you want me alone (baby I’m active)
You held me up when I was down & out
But I don’t want you waiting round for me 
I don’t want you waiting too long 

Yeah,
See I’m a star, look at me from afar 
Its hard to be down to earth, when you’re nesting on Mars 
You comet on how I move, too much space to assume but Ima tell you the truth, shit, 
now when I’m gone , and I rome round the globe, for three months that’s too long without something that’s sweet, so I phone little treats, that’s a snack, not a feast, they don’t mean much to me ‘cause I know 
that I have a bakery back at home 
Am I wrong for...(fuck, come on)

I’m on (don’t act like I’m average)
But you want me home
I’d get you what you want (superstar status)
But you want me alone (baby I’m active)
You held me up when I was down & out
But I don’t want you waiting round for me 
I don’t want you waiting too long 

I don’t want you waiting too long 
You held me up when I was down & out
But I don’t want you waiting round for me 
I don’t want you waiting too long

Drop the roof & let the smoke clear 
(Lemme hear that)
Drop the roof & let the smoke clear, 
I got diamonds doing toosie slides in both ears 
Dice rolling on the Las Vegas strip tonight 
Slip that on & we might miss the fight 

Fuck a knot I keep the guala in my shorty bag 
You Know she 1 of mine when she tattoo that ass 
I’m a loverboy, she love the toys. keep it coming, you a rider. 

This that “roll myself a jay & count my figures” shit 
This that “stepping out i feel like I’m that nigga” shit 
I dropped 30 on this room we ain’t gon’ sleep for shit 
If I catch you nodding off, then it’s gon’ be some shit 


But you can do what you wanna
Live how you wanna
Spend what you wanna 
Be who you wanna be 
A young stunna til I DIE (lord help me)


You can do what you wanna
Live how you wanna
Spend what you wanna 
Be who you wanna be 
A young stunna til I D.I.E 


Fuck it. I just run it up before I go, 
Would you tell the world my secrets if I let you close? 
M.I.A: Missing in action. 
‘Cause these days no “Kumbaya”
Niggas be blasting.
Living in the midst of this shit might drive you mad.
Feeling pretty mixed up, but this life shit ain’t all bad. 

Bloody, bloody murder. There ain’t no second chances. 
Shit crazy. As fuck. 


Just do what you wanna
Live how you wanna
Spend what you wanna 
Be who you wanna be 
A young stunna til I DIE 
You can do what you wanna 
Live how you wanna 
Spend what you wanna 
Be who you wanna be 
A young stunna til I DIE

Letra
Composição: Geizon Carlos Da Cruz Fernandes

Que o sol da manhã te dissolva
Seu vampiro de filmes pastelão
Mas quem vai nos julgar?!
Sou seu despenteado leão

Sei que cê me entende bem
Sempre foge quando namora
Se você não ama ninguém
Porque tá me escutando agora?

Sua linda tão louca, minha Monalisa tira a minha roupa
Me fascina nessa sina, me beija na boca
Minha mulher menina, me ensina ser vida louca,
Teu olho piscina, me afoga e faz boca a boca
Renova minha rima, vem de garfo que hoje é sopa
Menina...

Mas quem vai nos julgar?
Vilão particular

Se eu subo nesse palco aqui
Foi Deus que me criou assim

E os holofotes vem ao meu encontro, é que eu te amo e nem te conto
Não, não posso ser seu santo

Sou fato ou hipótese
Sou rei, cigano ou nômade
Desculpe esse meu jeito soberano
Mas hoje é por você que eu canto
É por você que eu canto

Sei que cê me quer também
Marília leoa gostosa, posso te ligar meu bem?
Que que cê tá fazendo agora?
Tão lindo, tão louco meu grande amigo, depois de você os outros são outros
Cê, tá fodido, vamos fazer amor cantar
O sertanejo antigo, me beija na boca amor
Pode ser até que você não me dê moral
Até me ver no espaço pela banca de jornal

Letra
Composição: César Lemos
Te Amo Demais

Eu sou assim
Nunca soube recitar poesias
Não sei palavras de amor
Não sou sedutor, não sei fingir, nem poderia

Eu não tenho ouro, nem prata
Mas o meu maior tesouro eu te dei
Só quero o seu amor e mais nada
Você precisa entender, é que eu não sei dizer

Só sei que eu te amo demais
Nas noites sozinho é o teu nome que eu chamo
Baby, eu te amo demais
Eu só sei dizer: Te amo, te amo

Palavras valem menos que um olhar
Meu coração é quem vai te explicar
Da cabeça aos pés, eu vou te beijar
Como um sábio na arte de amar

Não sei mentir para conquistar uma mulher
Daria tudo nesse mundo só pra ter você
O destino seja o que Deus quiser
Você precisa entender, é que eu não sei dizer

Só sei que eu te amo demais
Nas noites sozinho é o teu nome que eu chamo
Baby, eu te amo demais
Eu só sei dizer: Te amo, te amo

Só sei que eu te amo demais
Nas noites sozinho é o teu nome que eu chamo
Baby, eu te amo demais
Eu só sei dizer: Te amo, te amo

Te amo demais
Como eu te amo
(Baby, eu te amo) te amo demais
Eu só sei dizer: Te amo, te amo
Só sei que eu te amo demais (amo demais)

Mal Feito - LETRA
Compositor: Felipe Arná

Essa música eu fiz pra você
Nem perder seu tempo tentando me convencer
Peço paciência, escuta até o fim
Vai ficar claro pra você, como ficou claro pra mim

O seu beijo ficou ruim assim do nada
Frequentemente compara seu ex comigo
De repente pegou gosto por balada
Isso não faz sentido

Você começou a me tratar mal
E na hora de fazer amor
Sempre diz que não tá bem, não tá legal
Lembra quando eu perguntei se tinha outro alguém, você negou
Chegou na parte principal 

Você me traiu
Levou um tempo mas eu descobri 
Você não vale nada, tá claro pra mim
Seu plano era bom, era quase perfeito 
Pena que tudo que cê faz, cê faz mal feito
 
Me traiu
Levou um tempo mas eu descobri 
Você não vale nada, tá claro pra mim
Seu plano era bom, era quase perfeito 
Pena que tudo que cê faz, cê faz mal feito

Vai Lá Em Casa Hoje

Vou chamar ela Pra ver um filme lá em casa 
Mal sabe ela Que a minha Tv tá estragada 
Vou chamar ela Pra tomar um gin na taça 
Mas depois do que eu fizer com ela Ela vai pedir água 
Com uma carinha de apaixonada 
E As roupas pelo chão catando 
Pelo trato que eu vou dar nela 
Amanhã ela ligando falando 
Vai lá em casa hoje 
Bebe umas comigo 
Saudade de ontem 
De Você beijando 
Pra baixo Do meu umbigo 
Eu vou falar tô indo 
O que ela me pede sem roupa 
Eu faço rindo.

Compositores: Dê Angelo/ Júnior Gomes/ Thales Lessa/ Renno Poeta

Já que devolveu minhas roupas
Já que arquivou nossas fotos
Deve ter outra pessoa a posto

Tá aproveitando a vida
Os novos amigos 
Indo para lugares que não ia comigo
Tá se enganando e nem sabe disso

Beijar outras bocas depois que termina é fácil demais
Fazer sexo por fazer todo mundo faz
Mas esqueça-me se for capaz

Pode namorar e postar para tentar tirar a minha paz
Mudar telefone de cidade, vai
Mas esqueça-me se for capaz

Esquece aí, você não é o bichão?
Nunca esquecerão
Nunca?

Esqueça-me se for capaz…

Troca de Calçada - Letra
Compositores: Marília Mendonça / Juliano Tchula / Vitor Ferrari

Se alguém passar por ela fique em silêncio
Não aponte o dedo, não julgue tão cedo
Ela tem motivos pra estar desse jeito
Isso é preconceito

Viveu tanto desprezo
Que até Deus duvida e chora lá de cima
Era só uma menina
Que dedicou a vida a amores de quinta

É claro que ela já sonhou em se casar um dia
Não estava nos planos ser vergonha pra família
Cada um que passou levou um pouco da sua vida
E o resto que sobrou ela vende na esquina

Pra ter o corpo quente
Eu congelei meu coração
Pra esconder a tristeza
Maquiagem à prova d'água

Hoje você me vê assim e troca de calçada
Só que amar dói muito mais
Do que o nojo na sua cara

Pra ter o corpo quente
Eu congelei meu coração
Pra esconder a tristeza
Salto 15 e minissaia

Hoje você me vê assim e troca de calçada
Mas se soubesse um terço da história
Me abraçava e não me apedrejava

[ Letra ]
Compositores: Marília Mendonça/ Maraisa

Vem cá 
E se eu te disse que você tá perdendo o amor da sua vida
Você beberia mais uma?

Pra você é só mais um rolê, só mais uma ressaca
Pra ela outra mágoa, outro gatilho, outro trauma
Enquanto finaliza a saideira
Destrói os sonhos de uma vida inteira

Você curtindo o auge dos seus trinta e poucos anos
E ela te esperando acordada fazendo planos
Você não vai ganhar nada com isso
Não tem ninguém achando isso bonito

Cadê a sua responsabilidade? 
No seu lugar eu teria vergonha
Por mim, ela teria te deixado
Fazer o que se ela te ama
Então aproveita que ela nem sonha quem você é

É hora de parar com a presepada
Respeita a sua namorada
Agarra essa mulher e casa
Agarra ela e casa

Vive numa busca incessante 
Pra achar alguém interessante
Sem enxergar que ela é brilhante 
Que ela é rara 

É hora de parar com a presepada
Respeita a sua namorada
Agarra essa mulher e casa
Agarra ela e casa

Essa sua busca incessante 
Pra achar alguém interessante
Terminaria se enxergasse 
O que tem dentro de casa

Sabe aquela pessoa fantástica, diferente, especial, incomparável, acima da média?
Tá aí do seu lado

Letra:

Vou ser sincero com você
Acho que pra mim já deu
Faz um tempinho que não sou seu
Até a cama percebeu
Que esfriou demais
E seu toque não traz

Não adianta pôr graveto
Numa fogueira que não pega mais
Não pega mais, não pega mais

Você virou saudade aqui dentro de casa
Se eu te chamo pro colchão, você foge pra sala
E nem se importa mais saber o que eu sinto
Poucos metros quadrados, virou labirinto

Você virou saudade aqui dentro de casa
Se eu te chamo pro colchão, você foge pra sala
E nem se importa mais saber o que eu sinto
Poucos metros quadrados, virou labirinto

A gravação aconteceu no dia 07 de Outubro, na Praça da Estação em Belo Horizonte.

Sábado meia-noite,
Ainda não chegou notificação dele
Será que o álcool  ainda não fez efeito?
De passar pra cabeça o que tá no peito

Foi só eu falar 
Pra sentir meu celular vibrar
Áudio de 2 minutos pra lá
Zero paciência de escutar

Eu não sei o que lá te ama
Não sei o que lá saudade
Não sei o que lá vem me buscar aqui
Acelerei o áudio e foi só isso que eu entendi
Toda vez que ele bebe é assim
Toda vez que ele bebe é assim

Eu não sei o que lá te ama
Não sei o que lá saudade
Não sei o que lá vem me buscar aqui
Acelerei o áudio e foi só isso que eu entendi
Toda vez que ele bebe é assim
Eu digito que eu não vou mas já tô no caminho

Toda vez que ele bebe é assim
Eu não sei o que lá te ama
Não sei o que lá saudade
Não sei o que lá vem me buscar aqui

Telepatía
Quien lo diría
que se podría 
ser el amor por telepatía
La luna esta llena mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tu viera de frente la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día de noche y día

You know I’m just a flight a way
If you wanted you can take a private plane
Al kilómetros estamos conectando
y me prendes, aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
all these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estas pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estas maquinando

Quien lo diría
que se podría 
ser el amor por telepatía
La luna esta llena mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tu viera de frente te la volaría
De noche y de día
de noche y día

You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind
I can read your mind
What you want to do
It’s written all over your face times two
Cause I can read your mind
I can read your mind

I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you’re fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
On repeat

Quien lo diría
que se pudiera
ser el amor por telepatía
La luna esta llena mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tu viera de frente te la volaría
De noche y de día
de noche y día 

You know I got a lot to say
all these voice in the background of my brain

ENGLISH TRANSLATION:
Who would have known
that you can make love through telepathy
The moon is full my bed is empty
What I would do to you
if i had you in front of me i would blow your mind 
Night and day, night and day

You know I'm just a flight a way
If you wanted you can take a private plane
miles away we’re connecting and you turn me on without even touching me
You know I got a lot to say
all these voices in the background of my brain
And they tell me everything you're thinking
I imagine what you’ve already been plotting

Who would have known 
you could make love through telepathy
The moon is full my bed is empty
What I would do to you
if i had you in front of me i would blow your mind 
Night and day, night and day

You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind
I can read your mind
What you want to do?
It’s written all over your face times two
‘Cause I can read your mind
I can read your mind

I can hear your thoughts like a melody

Lyrics

[Intro: Bootsy Collins]
Ah
Whatever goes around
Eventually comes back to you
So you gotta be careful, baby
And look both ways
Before you cross my mind

[Verse 1: Kali Uchis & Bootsy Collins]
Did you ever wonder?
Yeah, do you ever wonder
What he might be going through on his own, and
The demons that he's facing alone
I hate that sometimes I can't go home
And it just the same on the phone, no
But everybody's gotta go on, don't they?
Yes, we do, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Kali Uchis & Bootsy Collins]
So if you need a hero (if you need a hero)
Just look in the mirror (just look in the mirror)
No one's gonna save you now
So you better save yourself
And everybody's hurting
Everybody's going through it
But you just can't give up now
'Cause you gotta save yourself
Yeah, gotta hang on, baby
[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
The sun'll come out
Nothing good ever comes easy
I know times are rough
But winners don't quit
So don't you give up
The sun'll come out
But we've been struggling endless days
Someday we'll find the love
'Cause after the storm's
When the flowers bloom

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Kali, what you mean?
I take it offensive
'Cause I'm the hottest flower boy
That popped up on the scene
Feeling better, better than ever
'Cause your umbrella, -brella (-brella, light)
Sun is beaming on me like headlights beaming on Bambi
Now let's pretend the street is the room
And you are a Camry
'Cause your drama candid
The Tito to my Randy
Now let's produce some thrillers
My chocolate wit' yo' vanilla, uh
[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
The sun'll come out
Nothing good ever comes easy
I know times are rough
But winners don't quit
So don't you give up
The sun'll come out
But we've been struggling endless days
Someday we'll find the love
'Cause after the storm...

[Bridge: Kali Uchis]
I know it's hard
But do you even really try?
Maybe you could understand
When all you had to do was ask
And just open your mind
When everything is passing by
And all you had to do was try
Yeah, all you had to was try

[Outro: Bootsy Collins & Kali Uchis]
Try, try, try, try, try
All you had to do was try
Try, try, try, try",True,True,321525259.0,contemporary R&B

[Intro: Amaarae] 
I feel like there’s nothing in my way 
All this money on me it feels amazing 
In the Range Rover I’m racing 
Me and your nigga still dating 
I don’t wanna talk I’m dancing dancing 

[Verse 1: Moliy]
I don't need no fake love

Moonwalk like Michael Jackson

[Verse 2: Kali Uchis] 
I really like your body I really like your body 
I don’t know why you hide it 
I wanna see it behind me 
U know u dont gotta lie to me 
Yo quiero sentirte’inside of me 
Todo el dia imaginándote 
Lo quiero pa mi to’ la noche
… & You know I don’t need no favors 
You know I don’t need no fake love 
I’m that bitch on & off of the cameras 
Type of bitch few people can handle
& I walk like I know my pussy dangerous 
talk like My words are made of angel dust 
When I whisper to u in a couple languages 

lo que quiero papi es besos en la espalda pues como cien billion de besos todo el día 
That’s the only thing k me da alegría 
..Sabes que yo Quiero hacerte cosas sucias 
Y quemarte con estas caricias 
tu lengua en todo mi cuerpo Cuando TERMINES 
te quedas por dentro

[Chorus: Moliy] 
Get the fuck outta my way
I'm gonna get paid yeah
I wanna get paid yeah
Just gimme my moolah-la-la
Get the fuck outta my way
I'm gonna get paid yeah
I'm gonna get paid yeah
Just gimme my moolah-la-la

[Verse 3: Amaarae] 
I really like to party 
I really like your body 
I really wanna get naughty 
I think you’re such a hottie 
Slow dancing in the party
Oya spray me the money 
Book a flight to Miami 
Baby take me out the country 
Why you wanna act like Leo
Like you don’t love me please 
Like you don’t spend money 
Like you don’t eat my pussy 
To the left to the right 
To the front with it 
Go yea yea yea
I know that’s right 
If the money’s going up 
Say yea yea yea

[LYRICS] 
Dollar bills x 6
She wants my hundred dollar bills
She don’t want love 
She wants my hundred dollar bills 
She don’t want love 
She wants my hundred
Oooooh
She wants my hundred
Oooooh

She’s a hurricane
Feel the earth shake 
If the devil was asleep she’d knock him wide awake
And if you were her you’ll never know I think you’d do it too
But if it takes one to know one you must not have a clue
So come on 
_____ don’t ever judge just wanna have a lil fun
Yea come on
No I won’t be here for long so ima say I’m on the run 
Go say what you want you’re just a stranger
Watching from the bridges cos you can’t take the danger 

She wants my hundred dollar bills
She don’t want love 
She wants my hundred dollar bills

""Swim"" Lyrics:

I bet you feel it now baby, especially since we've only known each other one day but,
I've gotta work shit out baby, I'm exorcising demons got em running round the block now,

Location drop now, 
Pedal to the floor like you running from the cops now,
Oh what a cop out,
You picked a dance with the devil and you lucked out,

The waters getting colder, let me in your ocean,
SWIM,
Out in California, I've been forward stroking,
SWIM,

So hard to ignore ya, especially when I'm smoking,
SWIM,
The world is on my shoulders, keep your body open,
swim,

Pop a couple pills in the daytime,
Heard you got a friend, what's her head like,
Probably should have fucked on the first night,
Now I gotta wait for the green light,

I don't wanna wait for no green light,
Narcolepsy got me feeling stage fright,
Luckily I float at insane heights,
Luckily, luckily, luckily, yah,

Location drop now, 
Pedal to the floor like you running from the cops now,
Oh what a cop out,
You picked a dance with the devil and you lucked out,

The waters getting colder, let me in your ocean,
SWIM,
Out in California, I've been forward stroking,
SWIM,

So hard to ignore ya, especially when I'm smoking,
SWIM,
The world is on my shoulders, keep your body open,
SWIM,

I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeh,

I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeh, 

Out in California, I've been forward stroking,
SWIM,
So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open,

SWIM,

Swim, push the water to the edge and watch it drip,
Check your footing don't get caught up in the rip no,
I know I said I'd call, I never did no,

Swim swim, I can take you even though I've never been,
The tide has currently been thrashing around me again and again now,
And I've been drowning for a minute your body keeps pulling me in, girl,


The waters getting colder, let me in your ocean,
SWIM,
Out in California, I've been forward stroking,
SWIM,

So hard to ignore ya, especially when I'm smoking,
SWIM,
The world is on my shoulders, keep your body open,
SWIM,

I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeh,

I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeh, 

Out in California, I've been forward stroking,
SWIM,
So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open,

""Consume"" Lyrics:

Alright alright, woah,
Why you pointing at me with that knife?
I've been cutting corners all my life girl,
But terror doesn't blossom overnight no,

She's running through the city in a rampage,
Pressing on her fingers til the bones break,
There's blood all in her nose from the propane,
Bet a needle to skin will make the pain fade,

Ah, ahh ahh,
This is what I do, ahh ahh,
Take another bite, ahh ahh,
Big enough to chew,

She said careful or you'll lose it,
But girl I'm only human,
And I know there's a blade where your heart is,
And you know how to use it,

And you can take my flesh if you want girl,
But baby don't abuse it,
These voices in my head screaming ""run now"",
I'm praying that they're human,

Rollin' rollin, rolling back your eyes to your mind like,
Oh, woah, the pressure in the gland's tight,
Yeah, woah, yeh it's either kill or be killed like,
Oh, woah, the blood is either poured or it's spilt like,

Ah, ahh ahh,
This is what I do, ahh ahh,
Take another bite, ahh ahh,
Big enough to chew,

She said careful or you'll lose it,
But girl I'm only human,
And I know there's a blade where your heart is,
And you know how to use it,

And you can take my flesh if you want girl,
But baby don't abuse it,
These voices in my head screaming ""run now"",
I'm praying that they're human,

Alright alright,
Love you but you cannot spend the night,
I've been alone almost all my life girl,
And shit like that don't change up overnight,

I let you sleep in my tee,
Tell me the things that you don't normally tweet,
Acid & LSD and smokin' blunts on the beach,
69 down 69 so we can both get a piece,
yeh

I've been cutting corners like my whole life,
Back stabbing bitches tryna kill me with the whole knife,
Day I die will be the only day a nigga ghostwrite,
When I go they'll treat me like a god if this shit goes right,

She said careful or you'll lose it,
But girl I'm only human,
And I know there's a blade where your heart is,
And you know how to use it,

And you can take my flesh if you want girl,
But baby don't abuse it, (calm down)
These voices in my head screaming ""run now"", (don't run)
I'm praying that they're human,

(Please understand that I'm trying my hardest,

My head's a mess but I'm trying regardless,

Anxiety is one hell of a problem,

She's latching onto me, I can't resolve it,

It's not right, it's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair, it's no fair, it no fair,

Oh no, don't run, don't run)",False,False,94434769.0,Not Found

Legends Never Die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends Never Die they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness 
Relentless you survive

They never lose hope when everything's cold and the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones they’ll run into smoke when the fire is fierce
'Oh pick yourself up, ‘cause

Legends Never Die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends Never Die they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness 
Legends Never Die

They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs, the scars collected all their lives

When everything’s lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream
'Oh pick yourself up, ‘cause

Legends Never Die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends Never Die they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness

LYRICS
Look out for yourself!

I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I’m searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world, that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you’re the greatest
But once you turn they hate us

Oh, the misery!
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy... y... y... y...
Look out for yourself!
My enemy... y... y... y...
Look out for yourself!
But I’m ready

Your words up on the wall, as you’re praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls, and the names that I’ve been called
I stack it in my mind, and I’m waiting for the time
When I show you what it’s like, to be words spit in a mic!
Tell you you’re the greatest
But once you turn they hate us

Oh, the misery!
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be 
My enemy... y... y... y...
Look out for yourself!
My enemy... y... y... y...
Look out for yourself!

Look, okay
I’m hoping that somebody pray for me
I’m praying that somebody hope for me
I’m staying where nobody ‘posed to be
P-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever just let me know
The road is long so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy’s on my trail, my energy unavailable
Imma tell ‘em hasta luego

They wanna plot on my trot to the top, 
I’ve been outta shape, thinkin’ out the box
I’m an astronaut, I blasted off the planet rock
To cause Catastrophe and it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shockin’ they wanted static with precision
I’m automatic quarterback, I ain’t talkin’ sacking
Pack it, pack it up, Iont panic, batter batter up
Who the baddest, it don’t matter, cause we at ya throat

Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
Oh, the misery!
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be 
My enemy

They say pray it away, I swear, I’ll never be a Saint, no way
My enemy
They say pray it away, I swear, I’ll never be a Saint

Look out for yourself!

Welcome to the wild, no heroes and villains
Welcome to the war we've only begun, so
Pick up your weapon and face it
There's blood on the crown go and take it
You get one shot to make it out alive, so
Higher and higher you chase it
It’s deep in your bones, go and take it
This is your moment, now is your time, so

Prove yourself and 
RISE, RISE
Make 'em remember you
RISE
Push through hell and 
RISE, RISE
They will remember you
RISE

Welcome to the climb up, reach for the summit
Visions pray that one false step lead the end, so
Higher and higher you chase it
It's deep in your blood, go and take it
This is your moment, take to the skies, go

Prove yourself and 
RISE, RISE
Make 'em remember you
RISE
Push through hell and 
RISE, RISE
They will remember you
RISE

So get along, so get along, go
Get along 'long get a move on up
So get along, so get along, go
Get along 'long get a move on up
And as you fight among the death beneath the dirt
Do you know yet?
Do you want it?
And when the giants call to ask you what you're worth
Do you know if,
Win or die, you'll

Prove yourself and 
RISE, RISE
Make 'em remember you
RISE
Push through hell and 
RISE, RISE
They will remember you
RISE
Prove yourself and RISE, RISE
(Pick up your weapon and face it)

Lyrics:

Don’t try to make yourself remember, darling
Don’t look for me, I’m just a story you’ve been told
So let’s pretend a little longer
Cause when we’re gone,
Everything goes on

Well, you were staring at the window
And I said, “I’ll just bring the sea to you”

But if I was gone tomorrow,
Won’t the waves crash on?
Is it selfish that I’m happy,
As we pass the setting sun?
Someday I’ll be overcast,
But you won’t have to cry -
Cause we’ll do the grieving
While I’m by your side
I said:

Don’t try to make yourself remember, darling
Don’t look for me, I’m just a story you’ve been told
So let’s pretend a little longer
Cause when we’re gone,
Everything goes on

And I’m so scared of getting used to this
All the vines that keep you tethered in your room
Said, ""I’m sorry that you worried""
But don’t apologize
I told you to forget me
But you stayed by my side
When I said:

""Don’t try to make yourself remember, darling
Don’t look for me, I’m just a story you’ve been told""
So let’s pretend a little longer
And when we’re gone,
Everything goes on

Lyrics:

As a child you would wait
And watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play
In youth you'd lay
Awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream!
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust.

Lyrics:

I lied awake for days,
Counting all the ways I died
Everything I couldn’t save 
Buried down, still half alive

It’s got me crawling in my skin
But no one’s coming now to hold me close
Pouring out the gasoline
Yeah, I’ve been making friends with all these ghosts

And I’ve got nothing left to lose

Fire to the fuse (yeah)
Fire to the fuse

I’m
Sick and it’s twisted
But I’m back 
With a match 
Yeah and I’m a buzzkill
With nothing to lose 

I’m 
Sinking my teeth in 
And I won’t
Let you go
We’re not having fun till…
You set fire to the fuse 

Well it’s not me to turn and run
Met the bitter truth and I choked it down 
Left a bad taste on my tongue 
But my appetites been growing now

I can see you crawling in your skin 
But no one’s coming now to hold you close
I’m pouring out the gasoline
So say hello to all my ghosts …

All alone 
I’m moving like your shadow 
You’re walking in my dead zone

Breathing slow
Love the hunt, love the high
Watching light fade from your eyes 

And this is not a warning 
This is not a test 
I’m zeroed in on you and I’m
coming for the rest 

And I’m about to ignite 
Just try to play it cool 
Echoes in your head like
Deja deja vu

What are you willing to lose?
You cover your wounds, but underneath them
A million voices in your head that whisper, ""Stop, now""
Another twist of the knife, turn of the screws
It's all in your mind and it's fighting you
Arm yourself, a storm is coming
Well, kid...
What you gonna do now?
It's your reflection looking back to pull you down 

So are you gonna die today or make it out alive?
You gotta conquer the monster in your head and then you'll fly
Fly, Phoenix, fly
It's time for a new empire
Go bury your demons then tear down the ceiling
Phoenix, fly

And now you're playing with matches, come out of the ashes
Underneath you, a million voices in the crowd they're screaming, ""Stop, now""
Well let 'em swallow their pride, you're turning the tide to true believers
Got them in the palm of your hand, you're playing God now
What you gonna do now?
It's your reflection looking back to pull you down 

So are you gonna die today or make it out alive?
You gotta conquer the monster in your head and then you'll fly
Fly, Phoenix, fly
It's time for a new empire
Go bury your demons then tear down the ceiling
Phoenix, fly

Riot Games presents Arcane, a new animated streaming television series on Netflix from the world of League of Legends. In the cities of Piltover and Zaun, unrest stirs as inventors and thieves, politicians and crime lords chafe against the constraints of a society torn asunder. As dissent reaches a fever pitch, two sisters steal an artifact of untold power. Discovery and danger intertwine as heroes are born and bonds are broken. Will this power change the world, or lead it to ruin? This is the world of Arcane. Champions Jinx and Vi struggle to overcome their shared past in a new era of magic and technology.

LYRICS

Who told you what was down here?
Come along, if you wanted a peek

I’ve seen your face around here
Come alone, tell me under the table
What do you seek?

Welcome to the playground, follow me
Tell me your nightmares and fantasies
Sink into the wasteland underneath
Stay for the night, I’ll sell you a dream

Ohh... Welcome to the playground

What brings you to the lost and found, dear?
Won’t you pull up a seat?
Everybody got a price ’round here to play
Make me an offer, what will it be?

Oh... what will it be?

Welcome to the playground, follow me
Tell me your nightmares and fantasies
Sink into the wasteland underneath
Stay for the night, I’ll sell you a dream

Ohh... Welcome to the playground
Ohh... Welcome to the playground

Welcome to the playground

Welcome to the playground

Welcome to the playground, follow me
Tell me your nightmares and fantasies
Sink into the wasteland underneath
Stay for the night, I’ll sell you a dream

** X CASO  ** testo:
Ce cunuscettemo pe caso, tu ire bella, troppo
Faceva friddo e te dette 'o giubbino mio Vuitton
Me diste 'a mano e camminajemo pe dduje metre
Po ce fermajemo, ce vasajemo senza sentí 'o gelo

Non so più cosa fai da sola senza me
Guardo il telefono e aspetto solo che chiami te
Scusami, ma non posso darti più di questo, babe
Perché ti ho dato tutto e ora non mi è rimasto niente

Io e te, tu e io, è la solita storia di sempre
Tu che fai l'incazzata per tutto il giorno
Ti chiedo: ""Cos'è?"", ma mi rispondi: ""Niente""
Ed è un casino a volte
Non so proprio che cosa c'hai in mente
Vengo da dove non credono all'amore
Vengo da dove non credono al ""Per sempre""
Chissà se tu staresti con me (Con me)
Anche senza cash (Oh no) o suite in hotel (Oh no)
Se al mio collo non brillassero VVS (Eh-eh-eh-eh)
E tornassi in quartiere (Eh-eh-eh-eh) tra quelle sirene
Baby, non sto bene se te ne vai via (Se te ne vai via)
Dimmi se senti anche tu la nostalgia (La nostalgia)
Non mi basterà fumare per dormire (Oh no)
Se ripenso a quando eri davvero mia
Eh, eh, eh

Ce cunuscettemo pe caso, tu ire bella, troppo
Faceva friddo e te dette 'o giubbino mio Vuitton
Me diste 'a mano e camminajemo pe dduje metre
Po ce fermajemo, ce vasajemo senza sentí 'o gelo

Nun saccio cchiù che faje sola senza 'e me
Guarde 'o telefono aspettanno ca chiamo i' a te
Scusame si nun te saccio dá cchiù assaje
Ma aggio dato a te ogni cosa 'a nn'tenere cchiù niente

Non so più cosa fai da sola senza me
Guardo il telefono e aspetto solo che chiami te
Scusami, ma non posso darti più di questo, babe
Perché ti ho dato tutto e ora non mi è rimasto niente

Letra:

Este es el remix

Sé que él te lastimó
Que tu corazón rompió
Pero hoy no es pa' llorar
Hoy es pura diversión

Así que de-ja-to-do-atra'
Pon-te-me a baila'
Pepa y marihua'
Na' pa-ra janguea'

Y mueve el culo en la playa
El sol combina con su malla
Y cuando fuma ella se desata
Esta cabrona está bellaca

Y mueve el culo en la playa
El sol combina con su malla
Y cuando fuma ella se desata
Esta cabrona está bellaca

Hace calor
En la playa to' apretao el putishort
Ese culo, mami, es uno en un millón
Tiene arena adentro la ropa interior
Y se la saco yo, yo

Hace calor
En la playa to' apretao el putishort
Ese culo, mami, es uno en un millón
Tiene arena adentro la ropa interior
Y se la saco yo, yo

Ti sta scomparendo il tanga 
Tanga in mezzo alle chiappe 
La mia tipa chiama pensa che ci siano altre
Con me nella stessa stanza sono in ciabatte sto fumando ganja 
Ganja vado su marte 
Hermano Kaleb che passa dall'Argentina all'Italia c'ho la tua tipa che chiama (hace calor)
Tu sei una Hakuna matata ma senza alcuna patata tamo ganando un milion

Hace calor
Hace calor
Hace calor
Hace calor

Le dije vente conmigo y se vino pero ella llamó otra amiga
Fiesta en la playa bebiendo y fumando volando con la medicina
Moviendo ese culo me quedo mirando pidiendo que se suba encima
Y como siga apretando la voy a romper como rompo tarima

Y dale botalo
Mami que te de de to'
Si lo hace como mueve
Ese culo una bendición
Se sale del pantalón
Esta noche puticort
Como te pillé en pompeta te voy a meter el cabezón

Y mueve el culo en la playa
El sol combina con su malla
Y cuando fuma ella se desata
Esta cabrona está bellaca

Hace calor
En la playa to' apretao el putishort
Con su amiga en la noche me llamó
Y como estaba solo le di a las dos
Le di a las dos

Hace calor
En la playa to' apretao el putishort
Ese culo, mami, es uno en un millón
Tiene arena adentro la ropa interior
Y se la saco yo, yo

Hace calor
Hace calor
Hace calor

Para las babys de todo el mundo
Omar, trae pa' tomar
Sfera Ebbasta, RVFV
El verdadero junte, ya tu sabes, internationality

Turreo místico

#DeanLewis #HowDoISayGoodbye 

LYRICS
 
Early morning 
There’s a message on my phone 
It’s my mother saying, “Darling, please come home” 
I fear the worst 
But how could you leave us all behind 
There’s so much to say but there's so little time 

So how do I say goodbye 
To someone who’s been with me for my whole damn life 
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine 
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye? 

When I couldn’t, you always saw the best in me 
Right or wrong you were always on my side 
But I’m scared of what life without you’s like 
And I saw the way she looked into your eyes 
And I promise if you go, I will make sure she’s alright 

So how do I say goodbye 
To someone who’s been with me for my whole damn life 
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes 
I see your face when I look at mine 
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye? 

And there’s no way you could ever let me down 
Gonna steal some time and start again 
You’ll always be my closest friend 
And someday we are gonna make it out 
Just hold the light, just hold the light 

So how do I say goodbye 
To someone who’s been with me for my whole damn life 
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes 
I see your face when I look at mine 
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye? 
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?

'BE ALRIGHT' LYRICS
[Verse 1]
I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me and I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold you pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind

And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend’s
They were my mate’s
And I feel the color draining from my face

[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

[Verse 2]
So I asked to look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past yea it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on

But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just want to stay

[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay

It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

[Bridge]
But nothing heals 
the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

But nothing heals 
the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

[Chorus]
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay

It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright",True,True,1411301562.0,pop music

LYRICS
[Verse 1]
I was wrong to say I loved her, I was wrong to think I’m right
When I told her it was over, oh my darling I had lied
I’ve been running from my demons, afraid to look behind
I’ve been running from myself, afraid of what I’d find
 
[Chorus]
But how am I supposed to love you when I don’t love who I am?
And how could I give you all of me when I’m only half a man?
‘Cause I’m a sinking ship that’s burning, so let go of my hand
Oh how can I give you all of me when I’m only half a man?
 
[Verse 2]
And now I’m stuck in this hotel room by a cold neon light
And I’ve been waiting for an answer, but it won’t come tonight
And every bottle I have stolen lay shattered on the floor
What’s broken can’t be whole anymore
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bridge]
And no one can ever hurt me like I hurt myself
‘Cause I’m made out of stone
And I’m beyond help, don’t give your heart to me
 
[Chorus]
 
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

'Waves' Lyrics

There is a swelling storm,
and i'm caught up in the middle of it all.
And it takes control,
of the person that I thought I was,
the boy I used to know.

But there, Is a light,
In the dark, and I feel its warmth.
In my hands, and my heart,
Why can't I hold on?

It comes and goes in waves,
It always does, it always does.
We watch as our young hearts fade,
Into the flood, into the flood

The Freedom, of falling,
a feeling I thought was set in stone.
It slips through, my fingers,
I'm trying hard to let go,
but it comes and goes in waves,
It comes and goes in waves,
and carries us away.

Through the wind, 
down to the place we used to lay when we were kids.
Memories, of a stolen place,
Caught in the silence, 
an echo lost in space.

It comes and goes in waves,
It always does, it always does.
We watch as our young hearts fade,
Into the flood, into the flood.

The Freedom, of falling,
a feeling I thought was set in stone.
It slips through, my fingers,
I'm trying hard to let go,
but it comes and goes in waves,
It comes and goes in waves,
and carries us away.

I watched my wild youth, 
disappear in front of my eyes.
Moments of magic and wonder,
seem so hard to find.
Is it ever coming back again?
Is it ever coming back again?
Take me back to the feeling when,
everything was left to find.

It comes and goes in waves,
It always does, ow it always does.

The Freedom, of falling,
a feeling I thought was set in stone.
It slips through, my fingers,
I'm trying hard to let go,
It comes and goes in waves,
It comes and goes in waves,
and carries us away.",True,True,468581960.0,pop music

LYRICS

I remember the day that we met, 
You were like a light I didn't know that I needed, 
You had a smile that could warm up the New York cold, 
It wasn't long till we both caught feelings, 
I didn't know that we both had demons, 
But it's funny how time reveals it all, 

Pre:
And you stayed out that night after we had a fight, 
and my friend said they saw you with him, 
At that bar where we met, while I'm here in our bed, 
Do you even regret what you did?

Chorus:
'Cause it was never meant to end like this, 
Standing in the rain in your black dress, 
So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this, 
And I’m not saying we were perfect, 
I hope that one night with him was worth it, 
But telling me that it was a mistake don't make it hurt less, 
It don't make it hurtless 

Verse:
I'm standing there as you list off your reasons, 
Made me feel like a fool for believing, 
You reach for my hand as I turn to leave, 
But you keep on holding on, 

Pre:
And your eyes started falling weighed down with despair, 
And you turned around and said this isn't fair, 
It was only one night there were no feelings shared, 
So I looked in your eyes and I said 

Chorus:
It was never meant to end like this, Standing in the rain in your black dress, 
So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this, 
And I'm not saying we were perfect, I hope that one night with him was worth it, 
But telling me that it was a mistake don't make it hurt less, 
It don't make it hurtless 

Bridge:
I know the day will come when this won't hurt anymore, 
And all the pain is just an afterthought, If I'm strong enough to let you in I can let you out again, 
And I hope someday you'll find someone to love you like I did 

Chorus:
'Cause it was never meant to end like this, 
Standing in the rain in your black dress, 
So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this, 
And I'm not saying we were perfect, 
I hope one night with him was worth it, 
But telling me that it was a mistake don't make it hurt less 
It don't make it hurtless 
It don't make it hurtless 
It don't make it hurtless

LYRICS
 
Early morning 
There’s a message on my phone 
It’s my mother saying, “Darling, please come home” 
I fear the worst 
But how could you leave us all behind 
There’s so much to say but there's so little time 

So how do I say goodbye 
To someone who’s been with me for my whole damn life 
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine 
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye? 

When I couldn’t, you always saw the best in me 
Right or wrong you were always on my side 
But I’m scared of what life without you’s like 
And I saw the way she looked into your eyes 
And I promise if you go, I will make sure she’s alright 

So how do I say goodbye 
To someone who’s been with me for my whole damn life 
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes 
I see your face when I look at mine 
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye? 

And there’s no way you could ever let me down 
Gonna steal some time and start again 
You’ll always be my closest friend 
And someday we are gonna make it out 
Just hold the light, just hold the light 

So how do I say goodbye 
To someone who’s been with me for my whole damn life 
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes 
I see your face when I look at mine 
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye? 
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?",False,True,4697361.0,pop music

LYRICS
 
Verse 
You’ve been working 10 hours
And your feet are still aching
You tell your friends to come over
To forget about your problems
 
You say you talked to somebody
He even looks like me
Oh baby why do you say things
That make me believe
 
Pre
That you’re sorry, you’re sorry
But you’re not sorry at all
I wonder how could it hurt you
You've got no feelings involved
And then I tell you want you 
And you say nothing at all
You say nothing at all…
 
Chorus
Cause I need someone who loves me
And I know it don’t come easily
And maybe I’m just not good enough at all to feel your love
So how am I supposed to let go
When you won’t let me let go
And maybe I’m just not good enough at all to feel your love
 
Verse
And now I’m walking down sunset
With my feelings on repeat
I wonder what you been thinking?
Oh, are you thinking about me?
 
Pre
Then you say that you love me
But you don’t love me at all
I wonder how could it hurt you
You've got no feelings involved
And then I tell you want you 
And you say nothing at all
And you say nothing at all…
 
Chorus
Cause I need someone who loves me
And I know it don’t come easily
And maybe I’m just not good enough at all to feel your love
So how am I supposed to let go
When you won’t let me let go
And maybe I’m just not good enough at all to feel your love
 
Bridge
You said, “Hey, I just wanna hear your voice”
I said, “Babe, you know that this was your choice”
You said, “Hey, I just wanna hear your voice”
I said, “Babe, you know that this was your choice”
But it means nothing at all…
 
Chorus
Cause I need someone who loves me
And I know it don’t come easily
And maybe I’m just not good enough at all to feel your love
So how am I supposed to let go
When you won’t let me let go
And maybe I’m just not good enough at all to feel your love
 
Outro 
To feel your love
To feel your love
And maybe I’m just not good enough at all to feel your love
 
To feel your love
To feel your love
To feel your love
