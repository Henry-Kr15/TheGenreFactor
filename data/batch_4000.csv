LYRICS:
[Verse 1]
Never knew how much i love you, never knew how much i care
When you put your arms around me, i get a fever that's so hard to bear

[Chorus 1]
You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning, fever all through the night

[Verse 2]
Sun lights up the daytime, moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name, and you know i'm gonna treat you right

[Chorus 1]
You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning, fever all through the night

[Verse 3]
Everybody's got the fever, that is something that you should know
Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, oh
Tell them about it
Romeo loved juliet, juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her, he said ""julie baby you're my flame""

[Chorus 1]
Thou givest fever, when we kisseth, fever with thy flaming youth
Fever - i'm afire, fever yea i burn forsooth

Verse 4]
Captain smith and pocahontas had a very bad affair
But when her daddy tried to kill him, she said ""daddy,daddy don't you dare""

[Chorus 1]
He gives me fever - with his kisses, fever when he holds me tight
Fever - i'm his missus, oh daddy won't you treat him right

[Verse 5]
Now you've heard our story, (oh, it's your story)
Here's the point we have made (i'm listening)
Chicks were born to give you fever (that's right)
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade

[Chorus 4]
They give you fever - when you kiss them, fever if you live and learn
Fever - till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn

[Outro]
Aha, what a lovely way to burn
I tell you, what a lovely way to burn
All right now, what a lovely way to burn
I like that, what a lovely way to burn
(You ain't right, ray)

Lyrics

Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine

Rides the Metal Monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller

Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees

A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas

Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller",True,True,104480046.0,heavy metal

Lyrics:
One life I'm gonna live it up
I'm takin' flight said I'll never get enough.
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud
I'm on top as long as the music's loud.
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die.
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
If you think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'.

That's right here's where the talkin' ends
Well listen this night there'll be some action spent.
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks.

If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again.
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
If you think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'.

In this world we're livin' in we have our share of sorrow
Answer now is don't give in aim for a new tomorrow.

Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah
Act tough ain't room for second best.

Lyrics:
Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone

I took the city 'bout one A.M, loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone

Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone

I'm aiming for ya
I'm gonna floor ya
My body's coming
All night long

The air's electric, sparkin' power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone

Lyrics:


You won't hear me, But you'll feel me
Without warning, somethings dawning, listen.
Then within your senses,
You'll know you're defenseless
How your heart beats, when you run for cover
Your cant retreat I spy like no other.

Then we race together. We can ride forever
Wrapped in horsepower, driving into fury
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me

I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover

We hold each other closer, as we shift to overdrive
And eveyrthing goes rushing by, with every nerve alive
We move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the sky
Love machines in harmony, we hear the engines cry.

I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover",True,True,41092630.0,heavy metal

Lyrics:

Angel put sad wings around me now
Protect me from this world of sin
So that we can rise again
 
Oh, angel, we can find our way somehow
Escaping from the world we're in
To a place where we began
 
And I know we'll find
A better place and peace of mind
Just tell me that it's all you want for you and me
Angel won't you set me free
 
Angel remember how we'd chase the sun
Then reaching for the stars at night
As our lives had just begun
 
When I close my eyes
I hear your velvet wings and cry
I'm waiting here with open arms
Oh can't you see
Angel shine your light on me
 
Oh, angel, we'll meet once more I'll pray
When all my sins are washed away
Hold me inside your wings and stay
Oh angel take me far away
 
Put sad wings around me now
Angel take me far away
Put sad wings around me now
So that we can rise again

Lyrics:
Howling winds keep screaming round
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town

Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler

Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers a last resort
Homing in its' cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught

Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler

As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind

Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
""Come to me"" it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descend the stairs

Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood",False,False,16618274.0,heavy metal

Letra/Lyrics:
En la vida conocí mujer igual a la flaca
Coral negro de la Habana, tremendísima mulata
Cien libras de piel y hueso, cuarenta kilos de salsa
Y en la cara dos soles que sin palabras hablan
Que sin palabras hablan

La flaca duerme de día, dice que así el hambre engaña
Y cuando cae la noche baja a bailar a la tasca
Y bailar y bailar, y tomar y tomar
Una cerveza tras otra, pero ella nunca engorda
Pero ella nunca engorda

Por un beso de la flaca daría lo que fuera
Por un beso de ella, aunque sólo uno fuera
Por un beso de la flaca daría lo que fuera
Por un beso de ella aunque sólo uno fuera
Aunque sólo uno fuera

Mojé mis sábanas blancas, como dice la canción
Recordando las caricias que me brindó el primer día
Y enloquezco de ganas de dormir a su ladito
Porque Dios que esta flaca a mí me tiene loquito
O-oh, a mí me tiene loquito

Por un beso de la flaca yo daría lo que fuera
Por un beso de ella, aunque sólo uno fuera

Letra/Lyrics:
Bonito, todo me parece bonito
Bonita mañana
Bonito lugar
Bonita la cama
Qué bien se ve el mar
Bonito es el día
Y acaba de empezar bonita la vida
Respira, respira, respira
El teléfono suena, mi pana se queja
La cosa va mal, la vida le pesa
Que vivir así ya no le interesa
Que seguir así no vale la pena
Se perdió el amor, se acabó la fiesta
Ya no anda el motor que empuja la tierra
La vida es un chiste con triste final
El futuro no existe pero yo le digo
Bonito todo me parece bonito
Bonita la paz, bonita la vida
Bonito volver a nacer cada día
Bonita la verdad cuando no suena a mentira
Bonita la amistad, bonita la risa
Bonita la gente cuando hay calidad
Bonita la gente que no se arrepiente
Que gana y que pierde, que habla y no miente
Bonita la gente por eso yo digo
Bonito, todo me parece bonito
Qué bonito que te va cuando te va bonito,
Qué bonito que te va
Bonito, todo me parece bonito
La mar la mañana, la casa, la sombra,
La tierra, la paz y la vida que pasa
Bonito, todo me parece bonito
Tu calma, tu salsa, la mancha en la
Espalda, tu cara, tus ganas el fin de semana
Bonita la gente que viene y que va
Bonita la gente que no se detiene
Bonita la gente que no tiene edad
Que escucha, que entiende, que tiene y que da
Bonito Portet, bonito Peret
Bonita la rumba, bonito José
Bonita la brisa que no tiene prisa
Bonito este día, respira, respira
Bonita la gente cuando es de verdad
Bonita la gente que es diferente
Que tiembla, que siente
Que vive el presente
Bonita la gente que estuvo y no está
Bonito, todo me parece bonito
Qué bonito que te va cuando te va bonito,
Qué bonito que te va

Estamos acostumbrados a ser escuchados, que no a escuchar. Nos gusta mucho pedir y recibir, mucho más que dar, y rara es la vez que damos sin esperar nada a cambio. 
Lo que me ha pasado últimamente es justo lo contrario, he recibido mucho sin pedir ni esperar nada. Cosas buenas, muy buenas: cariño, afecto, respeto, amor, de gente a la que conocía y de gente a la que no. Muchos eran, como dice mi amigo Mikel Erentxun, amigos desconocidos que con sus palabras de aliento me hicieron superar momentos difíciles. Gente supongo que de todo tipo (amigos desconocidos) que quisieron ayudarme y que precisamente por no conocernos, no esperaban nada de mi.

Letra/Lyrics:
Como una barca de papel que cuando se moja se hunde
Como una manzana que al morder la cabeza me confunde
Como una veleta que se mueve y al viento no obedece
Me gusta como eres
Como la balanza que mide el tiempo, la soledad y el silencio
Como un agujero en el cielo por donde se van los sueños
Como esa cesta que tanto cuesta llenar y que se vacía al momento
Me gusta como eres
Como una herida en el corazón que no me duele
Me gusta como eres
Como una ventana que al cerrar deja correr el aire
Una niña, una madre, una mujer en mi vida
Como una nube cargada de agua que moja la tierra seca
Como la manta que me protege cuando el invierno llega
Como esa vela que se prende y me rescata de la oscuridad
Me gusta como eres
Como la calle que siempre me lleva a ese sitio al que quiero llegar
Como ese bar en la carretera en el que me paro a descansar
Como esa patria sin bandera en la que me siento libre
Me gusta como eres

Starting with his first composition in 1884, he signed his name as Erik Satie.

Satie was introduced as a ""gymnopedist"" in 1887, shortly before writing his most famous compositions, the Gymnopédies. Later, he also referred to himself as a ""phonometrograph"" or ""phonometrician"" (meaning ""someone who measures (and writes down) sounds"") preferring this designation to that of ""musician,"" after having been called ""a clumsy but subtle technician"" in a book on contemporary French composers published in 1911.

In addition to his body of music, Satie also left a remarkable set of writings, having contributed work for a range of publications, from the dadaist 391 to the American Vanity Fair. Although in later life he prided himself on always publishing his work under his own name, in the late nineteenth century he appears to have used pseudonyms such as Virginie Lebeau and François de Paule in some of his published writings.

Satie was a colourful figure in the early 20th century Parisian avant-garde. He was a precursor to later artistic movements such as minimalism, repetitive music and the Theatre of the Absurd.
The Gymnopédies, published in Paris starting in 1888, are three piano compositions written by French composer and pianist, Erik Satie.

These short, atmospheric pieces are written in 3/4 time, with each sharing a common theme and structure. Collectively, the Gymnopedies are regarded as the precursors to modern ambient music[citation needed] - gentle yet somewhat eccentric pieces which, when composed, defied the classical tradition. For instance, the first few bars feature a disjunct chordal theme in the bass - first, a G-major 7th in the bass, and then a B-minor chord, also in the lower register. Then comes the one-note theme in D major. Although the collection of chords at first seems too complex to be harmonious, the melody soon imbues the work with a soothing atmospheric quality.

Satie himself used the term ""furniture music"" to refer to some of his pieces, implying they could be used as mood-setting background music. However, Satie used this term to refer to only some of his later, 20th century compositions, without specific reference to the Gymnopédies as background music. From the second half of the 20th century on, the Gymnopédies were often erroneously described as part of Satie's body of furniture music, perhaps due to John Cage's interpretation of them.

""Gnossienne"" is the name given to several piano pieces by French composer Erik Satie in the late 19th century.
Satie's coining of the word ""gnossienne"" was one of the rare occasions when a composer used a new term to indicate a new ""type"" of composition. Satie had and would use many novel names for his compositions; for example, ""ogive"" had been the name of an architectural element until Satie used it as the name for a composition, the Ogives Similarly with ""vexations"", ""croquis et agaceries"" and so on—but ""gnossienne"" was a word that did not exist before Satie used it to indicate a composition. ""Gnossienne"" appears to be derived from the word gnosis; Satie was involved in gnostic sects and movements at the time that he began to compose the Gnossiennes. However, some published versions claim that the word derives from Cretan ""knossos"" or ""gnossus"" and link the Gnossiennes to Theseus, Ariadne and the Minotaur myth.

The Gnossiennes were composed by Satie in the decade following the composition of the Trois Sarabandes (1887) and the Trois Gymnopédies (1888). Like these Sarabandes and Gymnopédies, the Gnossiennes are often considered dances. It is not certain that this qualification comes from Satie himself—the sarabande and the Gymnopaedia were at least historically known as dances.

The musical vocabulary of the Gnossiennes is a continuation of that of the Gymnopédies (a development that had started with the 1886 Ogives → Sarabandes → Gymnopédies → Gnossiennes) later leading to more harmonic experimentation in compositions like the Danses Gothiques. These series of compositions are all at the core of Satie's characteristic 19th century style, and in this sense differ from his early salon compositions (like the 1885 ""Waltz"" compositions published in 1887), his turn-of-the-century cabaret compositions (like the Je te Veux Waltz), and his post-Schola Cantorum piano solo compositions, starting with the Préludes flasques in 1912.

Starting with his first composition in 1884, he signed his name as Erik Satie.

Satie was introduced as a ""gymnopedist"" in 1887, shortly before writing his most famous compositions, the Gymnopédies. Later, he also referred to himself as a ""phonometrograph"" or ""phonometrician"" (meaning ""someone who measures (and writes down) sounds"") preferring this designation to that of ""musician,"" after having been called ""a clumsy but subtle technician"" in a book on contemporary French composers published in 1911.

In addition to his body of music, Satie also left a remarkable set of writings, having contributed work for a range of publications, from the dadaist 391 to the American Vanity Fair. Although in later life he prided himself on always publishing his work under his own name, in the late nineteenth century he appears to have used pseudonyms such as Virginie Lebeau and François de Paule in some of his published writings.

Satie was a colourful figure in the early 20th century Parisian avant-garde. He was a precursor to later artistic movements such as minimalism, repetitive music and the Theatre of the Absurd.

The Gymnopédies, published in Paris starting in 1888, are three piano compositions written by French composer and pianist, Erik Satie.

These short, atmospheric pieces are written in 3/4 time, with each sharing a common theme and structure. Collectively, the Gymnopedies are regarded as the precursors to modern ambient music[citation needed] - gentle yet somewhat eccentric pieces which, when composed, defied the classical tradition. For instance, the first few bars feature a disjunct chordal theme in the bass - first, a G-major 7th in the bass, and then a B-minor chord, also in the lower register. Then comes the one-note theme in D major. Although the collection of chords at first seems too complex to be harmonious, the melody soon imbues the work with a soothing atmospheric quality.

Satie himself used the term ""furniture music"" to refer to some of his pieces, implying they could be used as mood-setting background music. However, Satie used this term to refer to only some of his later, 20th century compositions, without specific reference to the Gymnopédies as background music. From the second half of the 20th century on, the Gymnopédies were often erroneously described as part of Satie's body of furniture music, perhaps due to John Cage's interpretation of them.

Chorus:
Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah, sendin' this one out
To my man, Killer B
No doubt indeed
Where that weed?
Nomsayin'?
That old real shit

[Verse 1]
There's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from
You could run, but you can't hide forever
From these streets that we done took
You walkin' with your head down, scared to look
You shook, ‘cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady
By the MAC one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home with
My skin is thick, ‘cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul
Before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
Into the drama I built
And all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
Put us together, it's like mixin' vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord, forgive me
The Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
That I can't say so it's left a untold fact
Until my death, my goal's to stay alive
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Chorus]
Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Verse 2]
I'm trapped, in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough
Y'know, when the dough get low the jewels go
But never that, as long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
Five-oh lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
Niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I live a world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin when he got bagged
That fucked me up, God, but shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples
When you're upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a two to four is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, ‘cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get
I'm stayin' in the projects forever
Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
If beef, we never separate and pull together
When worse comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot—fuck lookin' cute!
I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
Puffin L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
In the Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
You better realize

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Open your eyes and get wise
Look alive, in '95, word up
Hypnotic thug life, get that ass paralyzed
Nomsayin? Mobb Deep and all that

Mobb Deep, the legendary Hip-Hop duo from Queensbridge, is celebrating the 25th anniversary of their iconic sophomore album “The Infamous” this year by releasing “The Infamous – 25th Anniversary Expanded Edition” which includes bonus tracks ""Shook One, Part I"" (Original Version) and Infamous Sessions Mixes of ""The Money (Version 2)"" and ""Lifestyles Of The Infamous,"" now available digitally for the first time.

About The Infamous:
Originally released April 25, 1995 through RCA/Loud Records, The Infamous, Mobb Deep's second studio album, signified an important new sound and direction for East Coast hip-hop. Featuring contributions from illuminary guest artists including Nas, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, and Q-Tip, The Infamous marked Havoc and Prodigy's evolution from Queensbridge underground phenomenon to one of the most influential and successful duos in hip-hop, selling more than three million records. An immediate urban/pop crossover success, The Infamous entered the Billboard 200 at #15 and the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart at #3 the week of its release. The album generated four hit singles--""Shook Ones Pt. II,"" ""Survival of the Fittest,"" ""Temperature's Rising"" and ""Give Up the Goods (Just Step)""--and was certified RIAA gold in June 1995.

Originally released April 25, 1995 through RCA/Loud Records, The Infamous, Mobb Deep's second studio album, signified an important new sound and direction for East Coast hip-hop. Featuring contributions from illuminary guest artists including Nas, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, and Q-Tip, The Infamous marked Havoc and Prodigy's evolution from Queensbridge underground phenomenon to one of the most influential and successful duos in hip-hop, selling more than three million records. An immediate urban/pop crossover success, The Infamous entered the Billboard 200 at #15 and the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart at #3 the week of its release. The album generated four hit singles--""Shook Ones Pt. II,"" ""Survival of the Fittest,"" ""Temperature's Rising"" and ""Give Up the Goods (Just Step)""--and was certified RIAA gold in June 1995.

LYRICS 

Well I just heard the news today
It seems my life is going to change
I close my eyes, begin to pray
Then tears of joy stream down my face

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open

Well I don't know if I'm ready
To be the man I have to be
I'll take a breath, I'll take her by my side
We stand in awe, we've created life

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
Now everything has changed
I'll show you love
I'll show you everything

With arms wide open
With arms wide open
I'll show you everything, oh yeah
With arms wide open, wide open

If I had just one wish
Only one demand
I hope he's not like me
I hope he understands
That he can take this life
And hold it by the hand
And he can greet the world
With arms wide open

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
Now everything has changed
I'll show you love
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open

I'll show you everything, oh yeah
With arms wide open, wide open

Lyrics:
Affirmative may be justified
Take from one give to another
The goal is to be unified
Take my hand be my brother
The payment silenced the masses
Sanctified by oppression
Unity took a backseat
Sliding further into regression

One, oh one,
The only way is one
I feel angry I feel helpless
Want to change the world
I feel violent I feel alone
Don't try and change my mind

Society blind by color
Why hold down one to raise another
Discrimination now on both sides
Seeds of hate blossom further
The world is heading for mutiny
When all we want is unity
We may rise and fall, but in the end
We meet our fate together

One, oh one,
The only way is one
One, oh one,
The only way is one
I feel angry I feel helpless
Want to change the world
I feel violent I feel alone
Don't try and change my mind

Letra ''Vasos Vacíos” (Gabriel Julio Fernández Capello)

No sé qué día es hoy
Solo sé que te vi salir
Y en cinco minutos perdí
Las letras para hablarte a vos
Yo sé que no tengo palabras
Y nunca las voy a tener
Por eso aprovecho esta noche
Ya ves, estoy solo otra vez
Por eso aprovecho esta noche
Tal vez lo puedas entender
Que no me importa poner las letras
Solo me importa mi mujer
Mañana cuando te levantes
Y pienses lo que dije ayer
Ay viejo, en este juego
A mí siempre me toca perder
Siempre habrá vasos vacíos
Con agua de la ciudad
La nuestra es agua de río
Mezclada con mar
Levanta los brazos mujer
Y ponte esta noche a bailar
Que la nuestra es agua de río
Mezclada con mar
No sé bien que día es hoy
Solo sé que te vi salir
Y en cinco minutos perdí
Las letras para hablarte a vos
Yo sé que no tengo palabras
Y nunca las voy a tener
Por eso aprovecho esta noche
Ya ves, estoy solo otra vez
Por eso aprovecho esta noche
Tal vez lo puedas entender
Que no me importa poner las letras
Solo me importa mi mujer
Mañana cuando te levantes
Y pienses lo que dije ayer
Ay viejo, en este juego
A mí siempre me toca perder
Siempre habrá vasos vacíos
Con agua de la ciudad
La nuestra es agua de río
Mezclada con mar
Levanta los brazos mujer
Y ponte esta noche a bailar
Que la nuestra es agua de río
Mezclada con mar

Letra ''Siguiendo La Luna'' (Segio Rotman)

Siguiendo la luna no llegaré lejos, 
tan lejos como se pueda llegar 
las cosas que dije no tienen sentido 
no puedo detenerme, ponerme a pensar. 

Siguiendo la luna y su veta invisible 
la noche seguro que me alcanzará 
no es que tu mirada me sea imposible 
tan solo es la forma como caminás. 

Vamos mi cariño que todo está bien 
esta noche cambiaré, te juro que cambiaré 
Vamos mi cariño ya no llores más 
por vos yo bajaría el sol 
o me hundiría en el mar 
y esto parece verdad para mí. 

Suena como un crimen lo que tú me has hecho 
deberías ir a parar a la prisión 
Suena como un crimen que me hayas mentido 
que hayas engañado a este corazón. 

Siguiendo la luna no llegaré lejos, 
tan lejos como se pueda llegar 
son casi las cuatro de la madrugada 
mi casa brillaba cruzando ese mar. 

Vamos mi cariño que todo está bien 
esta noche cambiare, te juro que cambiaré 
vamos mi cariño ya no llores más 
por vos yo bajaría el sol 
o me hundiría en el mar. 

Y esto parece verdad para mí 
y esto parece verdad para mí 
y esto parece verdad para mí 
y esto parece verdad para mí 
y esto parece verdad para mí 
y esto parece verdad para mí 
y esto parece verdad para mí 
para mí, para mí, para mí 
Solo para mí....

Letra ''Matador'' (Flavio Cianciarulo)

Te Están Buscando Matador

Me dicen “El Matador”, nací en barracas
Si hablamos de matar mis palabras matan
No hace mucho tiempo que cayó el león Santillán
Y ahora sé que en cualquier momento me la van a dar
Matador, Matador ¿dónde estás Matador?
Matador, Matador 

Me dicen “El Matador” me están buscando
En una fría pensión los estoy esperando
Agazapado en lo más oscuro de mi habitación
Fusil en mano, espero mi final
Matador, Matador
Matador, Matador
La cana te busca Matador
La cana te prende Matador
¡Matador, Matador! ¿Dónde estás Matador?
¡Matador! Matador No te vayas Matador
¡Matador! ¡Matador, Matador!

Viento de libertad sangre combativa
En los bolsillos del pueblo la vieja herida
De pronto el día se me hace de noche
Murmullos, corridas y el golpe en la puerta 
Llegó la fuerza policial 
Matador, Matador
Mirá hermano en que terminaste
Por pelear por un mundo mejor
¿Qué suenan? Son balas, me alcanzan
Me atrapan, resiste, ¡Víctor Jara no calla!
¡Matador! ¡Matador!
Matador te están buscando
¡Matador! ¡Matador!
Matador te están matando
¡Matador! ¡Matador, Matador!
Valiente Matador
Me dicen “El Matador” de los 100 barrios porteños
No tengo por qué tener miedo mis palabras son balas
Balas de paz, balas de justicia
Soy la voz de los que hicieron callar sin razón
Por el solo hecho de pensar distinto ¡ay Dios!
Santa María de los Buenos Aires si todo estuviera mejor
¡Matador! ¡Matador! Si todo estuviera mejor
¡Matador! ¡Matador! ¿a dónde vas Matador?
¡Matador! ¡Matador, Matador!

Letra ''Mal Bicho'' (Flavio Cianciarulo)

Vos que andás diciendo 
que hay mejores y peores 
vos que andás diciendo 
qué se debe hacer 
escucha lo que canto 
pero no confundir! 
es de paz lo que canto 
Qué me hablas de privilegios 
de una raza soberana?
Superiores, inferiores 
minga de poder! 
Cómo se te ocurre 
que algunos son elegidos 
y otros son para el descarte?
ambiciones de poder... 
Es malo tu destino 
¿Qué marcó tu camino? 
la canción que es valiente 
es canción para siempre 
Como dijo mi abuela: 
“aquí el que no corre vuela”
y en el planeta son tantos 
cómo pueden ser tantos? 
En la escuela nos enseñan a memorizar 
fechas de batallas 
pero que poco nos enseñan de amor 
discriminar, eso no está nada bien 
ante los ojos de Dios todos somos iguales 
sos el que hace las guerras 
dicta falsas condenas 
el que ama la violencia 
que no tiene conciencia... 
Mal bicho 
Todos dicen que sos mal bicho 
así es como te ves 
Mal bicho... 
¿Por qué vas lastimando a quien se ve distinto? 
imponiendo posturas 
solo con mano dura 
Vos tenés pal´ abrigo 
otros mueren de frío 
sos el que anda matando el que va torturando... 
yo no voy 
a las guerras 
a la violencia 
a la injusticia
y a tu codicia... 
digo no!!! 
paz en el mundo.

Letra ''Manuel Santillán, El León” (Flavio Cianciarulo)

“El León” está escondido en el callejón 
Y sabe bien lo que le va a pasar 
Entonces saca su revolver 
Y va a disparar 
La policía lo rodea sin tregua 
Lo buscan por ajuste de cuentas 
Y es el sargento que sin vacilar 
Abre fuego y le da 
Lo curioso es que antes de morir 
“El León Santillán” pronunció palabras 
Ante los oficiales 
Que desconcertados miraban 
Y les dijo:
“Queridos enemigos de siempre 
Hoy dejo este mundo de dolor 
Nunca se olviden 
Que el llanto de la gente 
Va hacia el mar”
Van al mar, van al mar 
Llanto y dolor
Sufrimiento de un pueblo 
Se ahoga y se hunde en el mar 
Van al mar, van al mar 

Llanto y dolor
Sufrimiento de un pueblo 
Se ahoga y se hunde en el mar
Lo dijo el león (Manuel Santillán)
Lo dijo “El León”, 
Viejo peleador de San Telmo
Lo dijo “El León”, “Manuel Santillán, El León”
Lo dijo “El León”,

Los oficiales que vieron 
Morir a Santillán 
Abandonaron la institución 
Nunca más se supo de ellos 
Del caso no se habló más 
Sin embargo 
Por el viejo San Telmo 
En un sucio bodegón 
Dicen que un borracho 
Murmuró llorando las palabras 
Que eran del León
¿Y cuáles eran Manuel?
Van al mar, El León Manuel, van al mar 
Llanto, dolor
Sufrimiento de un pueblo 
Se ahoga en el mar 
Van al mar, van al mar 
Llanto y dolor
Sufrimiento de un pueblo 
Se ahoga en el mar

Van al mar, van al mar 
Llanto, dolor
Sufrimiento de un pueblo 
Se ahoga en el mar 
Van al mar, van al mar
Llanto y dolor
Sufrimiento de un pueblo 
Se ahoga en el mar
Van al mar, van al mar 
Llanto, dolor
Sufrimiento de un pueblo 
Se ahoga en el mar 

Van al mar, van al mar

Letra ''Padre Nuestro"" (Gabriel Fernández Capello) 

Me estás consumiendo, me estás malgastando
Me estás desesperando y yo me arrodillo por vos
Me estás confundiendo, me estás caminando
Y estás resecando, ay Señor, mi corazón

Quiero ver amanecer,
Pero del otro lado ver amanecer
Pero que alguien se quede aquí para saber si yo sigo vivo
Quiero ver amanecer,
Pero del otro lado ver amanecer
Pero que alguien se quede aquí para saber si yo sigo vivo
Tengo el alma escapada, la conciencia mareada
Mi vida esta tan cansada, de buscar tu perdón
Vengo volando muy bajo, buscando algún claro donde descansar
Es que me vengo bandeando, me estoy cayendo de tanto esperar

Quiero ver amanecer,
Pero del otro lado ver amanecer
Pero que alguien se quede aquí para saber si yo sigo vivo
Quiero ver amanecer,
Pero del otro lado ver amanecer
Pero que alguien se quede aquí para saber si yo sigo vivo

Cielo bonito devuelve mi alma,
Cielito yo te pido otra oportunidad
Cielo no me hundas, no me desmorones
Cielito no me dejes sin saber la verdad

Cielo bonito devuelve mi alma,
Cielito yo te pido otra oportunidad
Cielo no me hundas, no me desmorones
Cielito no me dejes sin saber la verdad

Quiero ver amanecer,
Pero del otro lado ver amanecer
Pero que alguien se quede aquí para saber si yo sigo vivo
Quiero ver amanecer,
Pero del otro lado ver amanecer
Pero que alguien se quede aquí para saber si yo sigo vivo

Me escape de mi casa, me escape de mi amor,
Pero nadie se escapa de tu mano Señor. 

Quiero ver amanecer,
Pero del otro lado ver amanecer
Pero que alguien se quede aquí para saber si yo sigo vivo
Quiero ver amanecer,
Pero del otro lado ver amanecer
Pero que alguien se quede aquí para saber si yo sigo vivo.

Por eso quiero ver amanecer,
Pero del otro lado ver amanecer
Pero que alguien se quede aquí para saber si yo sigo vivo.

Letra ''Demasiada Presión” (Gabriel Fernández Capello)

Tomaste el vaso aquel
Aquel que no debes tomar
Saliste a caminar
Y decidiste irla a buscar
Mil veces y una más
Juraste no volverla a ver
La fiesta terminó
Ya no podés tenerte en pie
Esta noche es hora de que pienses en cambiar
El tiempo pasa pronto y todo tiene su final
Pasa, pasa, pasa, pásame un vaso más
Volvamos caminando pero elijamos el lugar
Noche de calor en la ciudad
Ella te dejó y todo sigue igual
Mil veces y una más
Juraste que ibas a crecer
Y solo una vez más
Creciste hasta morir sin ver
La fiesta terminó
No te pudiste controlar
Mil golpes y uno más
La noche te volvió a pegar
Esta noche es hora de que pienses en cambiar
El tiempo pasa pronto y todo tiene su final
Pasa, pasa, pasa, pásame un vaso más
Volvamos caminando pero elijamos el lugar
Noche de calor en la ciudad
Ella te dejó y todo sigue igual
Quisieras volver el tiempo atrás
Pero lo que vuelve es esta noche y nada más
Noche de calor en la ciudad
Ella te dejó y todo sigue igual
Quisieras volver el tiempo atrás
Pero lo que vuelve es esta noche y nada más
Esta noche es hora de que pienses en cambiar
El tiempo pasa pronto y todo tiene su final
Pasa, pasa, pasa, pásame un vaso más
Volvamos caminando pero elijamos el lugar
Esta noche es hora de que pienses en cambiar
El tiempo pasa pronto y todo tiene su final
Pasa, pasa, pasa, pásame un vaso más
Volvamos caminando pero elijamos el lugar.

Letra ''El Satánico Dr. Cadillac'' (Gabriel Fernández Capello)

Voy a tomar por vos
Otro trago para olvidar
Que el miedo te comió los pies
Y que ahora sos un tipo más
Y que poco a poco te fuiste yendo
Que poco a poco te fuiste yendo de nuestro lugar
Te sienta bien el sol
Te sienta bien ser cool
Te sienta bien el mal
Te sienta bien ser Dios
Te sienta bien mentir, y decir
Que te fuiste yendo de nuestro lugar
Qué es lo que ha pasado con tu corazón?
Ya no marca el paso que marcaba ayer
Nunca fuiste libre y esa es la razón
Siempre algún idiota para convencer
Hablás toda la noche como un boy scout
Hablás sobre mi vida como tu papá
Los cadillacs tocando para vos
Los cadillacs tocando para vos
Qué es lo que ha pasado con tu corazón?
Ya no marca el paso que marcaba ayer
Nunca fuiste libre y esa es la razón
Siempre algún idiota para convencer
Hablás toda la noche como un boy scout
Hablás sobre mi vida como tu papá
Los cadillacs tocando para vos
Los cadillacs tocando para vos
Los cadillacs tocando para vos
Los cadillacs tocando para vos, yeah
Voy a tomar por vos
Otro trago para olvidar
Que el miedo te comió los pies
Y que ahora sos un tipo más
Y que poco a poco te fuiste yendo
Que poco a poco te fuiste yendo de nuestro lugar
Te sienta bien el sol
Te sienta bien ser cool
Te sienta bien el mal
Te sienta bien ser dios
Te sienta bien mentir, y decir
Que te fuiste yendo de nuestro lugar
Qué es lo que ha pasado con tu corazón?
Ya no marca el paso que marcaba ayer

LYRICS ///// TheFatRat - Rise Up ///// LYRICS


VERS:
When you feel it’s hopeless 
When you think that you lost
Oh
I will take your hand and
We‘ll rise up from the dust
Oh


PRE:
Here we go go go
Let us heal and grow
You won‘t be alone
We‘re unstoppable


Don’t be ‚fraid to show
What we‘re going for
This is what we know


CHORUS:
Here we come back to life, we‘re still breathing
Standing up, everybody‘s gonna see it
Oh all you need to know is that we‘re holding on
Even if we fall
We rise up 


And we follow the path that we believe in
No we‘re not gonna stop until we reach it
Oh all you need to know is that we‘re holding on
We rise up from the dust and claim our throne


VERS2:
We all have our reasons
Why we are on this track
Oh
We all have our burdens yeah but
We just keep on fighting and we never look back

LYRICS ////////// BACK ONE DAY (OUTRO SONG) ////////// LYRICS

VERSE 1
All the roads we travelled
The journey of our lives
Take another picture
Before we say goodbye
Arm in arm we’re standing 
Standing side by side
Memories fade but legends never die

CHORUS
One last time let’s live for something
I can feel my blood it’s rushing
This ain’t goodbye we’ll be back someday
And we will find our way
Take control of our fate
And like a car with no brakes
Crash and learn make mistakes
And we’ll be back one day
We‘ll be back one day

VERSE 2
I don’t really ever wanna hold back
I got dreams wanna go fast
Know this energy’s here to last
Not a glass half full overflow that uh
Gotta Keep your eyes up on the prize 
Only got one life so it’s worth a try
To find what makes you feel alive
That’s the only way to live it right uh
And now we’re all doing our own things
But I’ll never forget our glory days 
My mind is full of the memories yea 
And I'll never forget what they meant to me
Don’t worry we’ll be back one day
Just celebrate our glory days
We‘ll be back one day

BRIDGE
Although it‘s over now
Don‘t let it get you down
We‘ll be back around
For now we can feel some sorrow
A new day it starts tomorrow
We‘ll wake up
New dreams to follow
A new goal and brand new motto

CHORUS
One last time let’s live for something
I can feel my blood it’s rushing
This ain’t goodbye we’ll be back someday
And we will find our way
Take control of our fate
And like a car with no brakes
Crash and learn make mistakes
And we’ll be back one day
We‘ll be back one day
We‘ll be back one day

LYRICS ////////// WE'LL MEET AGAIN//////////


VERS 1 

suddenly you're nowhere to be found 
I turn around and everything has changed
looking for a way to work it out
I'm trying to find some peace to nevigate 

CHORUS 

the oak tree
where are meet you
and the writing
on a statue 
I still remember every word you said 


I'm not a soldier
but I'm fighting
can you hear me through the silence ? 
I won't give up cause
there will be a day
we'll meet again

VERSE 2 

Everything we wanted turned to gold 
the path we chose , the future on our side 
never thought I'd do this on my own 
but now I wield the sword you left behind 

CHORUS 

Dark for the sunrise
clouds for a blue sky 
space for the traveling star 

Strong form the inside
you're still my life line 
I fell you wherever you are 

CHORUS

LYRICS ///// TheFatRat & Maisy Kay - The Storm (incl. Na'vi from Avatar) ///// LYRICS

Za’u oe fru iknimaya
Nìftxavang ting mikyun, ting nari
Tompayä kato, tsawkeyä kato
Sì’ekong te’lanä oeru teya si

I found a light inside me
I wanna let it glow
Keep shining bright beside me
Follow where I go

So when the thunder comes and
The storm becomes the night
I’ll guide you through the lightning
Stay close by my side

Up in the clouds I found my voice
Up past the shouts and broken noise
So don’t let me fall, where I don’t belong
I can’t go back and lose it all

'Phife Dawg: And me the five footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter
Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?
Um um, a tidbit, um, a smidgen
I don't get the message so you gots to run the pigeon
You on point Phife?
All the time, Tip
You on point Phife? 
All the time, Tip
You on point Phife? 
All the time, Tip
Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that body in El Segundo then +Push it Along+
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shot of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On job remaining, no I'm chaining cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check it out Check it out
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all Play tapes y'all
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check it out Check it out
Back in days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fitting
It was I the Phifer 
And me The Abstract
The rhymes were so rumping that the brothers rode the 'zack
Yo Tip you recall when we used to rock
Those fly routines on your cousin's block
Um, let me see, damn I can't remember
I receive the message and you will play the sender
You on point Tip?
All the time Phife
You on point Tip? 
Yeah, all the time Phife
You on point Tip? 
Yo, all the time Phife
So play the resurrector and give the dead some life
Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed. I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must I go to gain respect? Um
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it. Look at how they act
Off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll storm with the crew and
Proper. What you say Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop
NC, y'all check the rhyme y'all
SC, y'all check it out y'all
Virginia, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out. Out

With an abrasive call to arms opening up proceedings, “I feel like dancing!” is an instigating declaration that demands attention, bouncing off the walls with a tightly-wound reverb before colossal rolling kick drums bring a dense dominance to the release. With clapping, splintering-style beats, and an ever-evolving rhythm, the heavy synth melody mutates into full-blown techno, sure to gust the speakers off when dialed up to ten. 

As the mantra-leading title appears throughout the track, the tempo pulls back before alerting the listener of its return with a self-explanatory vengeance, causing turbulence with its consistently ascendant and throttling force, ‘I FEEL LIKE DANCING’ is not one for the faint-hearted and is sure to get blood pressures rising with excitement this Summer!

After the long-awaited release of Hardwell’s latest solo project ‘REBELS NEVER DIE’, the Dutch EDM powerhouse returns to the limelight with the ‘DELUXE EDITION’ just in time for his world tour.

Two months on from the release of his widely recognized album ‘REBELS NEVER DIE’, Hardwell is back with more top-quality EDM music for his fans to digest. With his coveted world tour well underway, it’s the perfect time to bolster the already killer track list with three brand-new reworks of Hardwell tracks in the techno-influenced big room style of ‘REBELS NEVER DIE’. Two solo efforts and the tracklist's first collaboration are introduced in the deluxe version; ‘Spaceman’ and ‘Retrograde’ are the solo tracks and ‘Big Room Never Dies’, Hardwell’s classic collab with Blasterjaxx and Mitch Crown is also included. Along with these two fabulous reworks, this new edition will include a brand new track called ‘OH GOSH’ and an epic mashup with Metallica’s ‘Nothing Else Matters’.

Originally released in 2012, ‘Spaceman’ has remained one of Hardwell’s most successful songs, even now, a decade on. Originally loved for its summery, bouncy vibe, Hardwell has reintroduced the song with a more industrial twang, replacing the bounce of the original with squelching synths and a relentless bassline. Much of the same is true for the two other reworks; Hardwell’s sonic profile has changed exponentially in the time since these songs were originally released, what better way to display his growth than to rework the songs that made him successful. Hardwell does this effortlessly on these three reworked tracks, modernizing the classic cuts and packaging them into something which better suits his musical style in 2022.

Label boss Hardwell teams up with long-time Revealed key player Maddix to present ‘Bella Ciao’ on Revealed Recordings. The track samples the Italian classic ‘Bella Ciao’, made famous by the popular ‘La Casa De Papel’ series, and was premiered by Hardwell during his set at this year’s Tomorrowland, and the hype has been building ever since.

The track is introduced with the original Italian folk song kicking off proceedings, before electronic elements are added, highlighted by a synth that mirrors the original melody, gliding from note to note. That is layered with multiple stadium ready accompaniments that beef out the track on the drop. Light plucks are introduced in the main break to reduce the heat, quickly switching up as the intensity increases again, the track building towards it’s anthemic finish with a shephard tone riser and expertly programmed snares.

The anticipation for this track has reached fever pitch since it was first heard, and now fans finally have the chance to grab a copy of ‘Bella Ciao’ when it is released 17th August via Revealed Recordings.

Hardwell releases the vocal version of the worldwide hit 'Spaceman'.  Mitch Crown has provided the vocals for this track now going by the name 'Call Me A Spaceman'.

The Music Video for 'Call Me A Spaceman' is a combination of 3D animation with the 'Spaceman' of the original artwork as the leading part along with the high energized live footage editing Hardwell's video's are famous for. This Music Video also has some stunning sound effects added for that special space ride experience.

'Call Me A Spaceman' is the official successor to the worldwide hit 'Cobra' which has been topping the dance chart all over the world. Spaceman saw it's release in February and landed on the #2 spot at Beatport and has been setting dance floors on fire for months. The instrumental version got signed to over 15 countries. With this version the cross over to radio is a fact on which Mitch Crown provided the vocals. Mitch Crown is a well known singer/songwriter in todays dance scene and already worked with Fedde Le Grand and on successful solo projects.

The 24-year-old talent is surely one of the most successful producers/DJ's of today. In 2011 he entered the renowned DJ Mag Top 100 poll as the highest Dutchman, at number 24. In the past 2 years, Hardwell has collaborated with the likes of Tiësto, as well as creating remixes for the likes of Rihanna, Taio Cruz, Armin van Buuren and Martin Solveig. 

The success of this talented artist is out of this world. This year he won the IDMA award for Best Breakthrough DJ in Miami and with this release Hardwell is aiming high for that worldwide summer anthem.

Really excited to finally share this collab with AR/CO. Mali and Leo are not just super talented musicians but also amazing human beings. To me this record sounds like what freedom feels like. It’s our way to explore the world again after not being able to travel for a long time. My only advice would be to close your eyes, turn up the volume and enjoy the journey.

Hope this new piece of music lifts your spirits a little in these hard times! Bad is a cheeky track about guilty pleasures, which we can all relate to in one way or another, right!? Musically speaking I really wanted to explore different sounds and push my own sonic boundaries as a producer with a fresh approach. Bad features the vocal talent of Zak Abel, who has been high on my collaboration wishlist for years. I literally had the best time recording the vocals in my studio in Amsterdam with Zak and I look forward to performing the song together live for first time in the near future when we are allowed tp play outside again. Stay safe, stay at home. Love you guys. Xxx,

""My Feelings For You"" was the first Avicii record I came across twelve years ago. I have always been a fan of the original record by Cassius whom I had just remixed around that same time. So the record always held a special place in my heart, especially since both Tim and Zdar from Cassius are no longer with us. Mental Health and losing important people have always been a big part of my personal journey in this life and I know many of us struggle with the same issues on a daily basis, so I am happy to use my creativity together with the Vicious team to help raise money for the Tim Bergling foundation in memory of Avicii to help make the world a better place, one small step at a time.

Lyrics:
I am not the one who like degrading
Why you gotta test my patience
Left you behind like a station
Sorry but you are not the one I'm chasin’

I am not property
You better start speaking to me properly 
Getting too many things onto me
And you still could've been on with me

Ven aqui
Ven a Bailar
Men don't know how to hablar

You think that it's okay
You know it's not okay

Baby, Baby, No pienses que te quiero (x4) 

Hey Ali, Hey Ali
See the things you did
See the effects you had on this girl
I know you ain't tryna do wrong
I know the feelings were strong 
God gave you that bond

Ven aqui
Ven a Bailar
Men don't know how to hablar

You think that it's okay
You know it's not okay

Baby, Baby, No pienses que te quiero (x4)

Baby, Baby, No pienses que te quiero

I am not the one who like degrading
Why you gotta test my patience

I am not property
You better start speaking to me properly 

Getting too many things onto me
And you still could've been on with me

Ven aqui
Ven a Bailar
Men don't know how to hablar

You think that it's okay
You know it's not okay

Baby, Baby, No pienses que te quiero (x4)

The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)
He's all alone through the day and night (day and night)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)

Day and night (day and night)

Survive is one of those records I wanted to get just perfect from start to finish. I wanted it to stand out and the goal was to combine three different worlds. A Dutch electronic music producer mixed up with an incredible UK singer songwriter and one of the biggest US rappers, that's not something you come across every day. All three of us did something different from what we normally do but at the same time I feel we were all able to add our own trademark signature to the song. I am more than proud of the final outcome and hope the music and the message of the song will motivate people to dream big and see beyond the clouds of their personal challenges.
-Don Diablo

I’m So Happy to be collaborating with the very talented Don Diablo. I love his unique creativity and his deep passion for music. It was a real pleasure to write and lay down the vocal on this powerful track. I’m excited for everyone to hear it! I really hope this song will empower people to find pride and confidence in their own story of survival.

Lyrics:

Sometimes you’re better off dead
There’s a gun in your hand and it’s pointing at your head
You think you’re mad, too unstable
kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
in a restaurant in a West End town
Call the police! There’s a madman around
Running down underground
to a dive bar in a West End town

In a West End town, a dead end world
the East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead end world
the East End boys and West End girls
West End girls

Too many shadows, whispering voices
faces on posters, too many choices
If? When? Why? What?
How much have you got?
Have you got it? Do you get it?
If so, how often?
Which do you choose
a hard or soft option?
(How much do you need?)

In a West End town, a dead end world
the East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead end world
the East End boys and West End girls
West End girls
West End girls

(How much do you need?)

In a West End town, a dead end world
the East End boys and West End girls
A West End town, a dead end world
East End boys, West End girls
West End girls

You got a heart of glass or a heart of stone?
Just you wait ’til I get you home
We’ve got no future, we’ve got no past
Here today, built to last
In every city, in every nation
from Lake Geneva to the Finland station
(How far have you been?)

And a West End town, a dead end world
the East End boys and West End girls
A West End town, a dead end world
East End Boys, West End girls
West End girls

Lyrics:

When I look back upon my life
it’s always with a sense of shame
I’ve always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
no matter when or where or who
has one thing in common too

It’s a, it’s a, it’s a, it’s a sin
It’s a sin
Everything I’ve ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I’ve ever been
Everywhere I’m going to
It’s a sin

At school they taught me how to be
so pure in thought and word and deed
They didn’t quite succeed
For everything I long to do
no matter when or where or who
has one thing in common too

It’s a, it’s a, it’s a, it’s a sin
It’s a sin
Everything I’ve ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I’ve ever been
Everywhere I’m going to
It’s a sin

Father forgive me
I tried not to do it
Turned over a new leaf
then tore right through it
Whatever you taught me
I didn’t believe it
Father you fought me
‘cause I didn’t care
and I still don’t understand

So I look back upon my life
forever with a sense of shame
I’ve always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
no matter when or where or who
has one thing in common too

It’s a, it’s a, it’s a, it’s a sin
It’s a sin
Everything I’ve ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I’ve ever been
Everywhere I’m going to I
It’s a sin

Confiteor Deo omnipotenti vobis
fratres quia peccavi nimis cogitatione, verbo, opere
et omissione. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.

Come on, come on, come on, come on

(Together) We will go our way
(Together) We will leave someday
(Together) Your hand in my hand
(Together) We will make our plans
(Together) We will fly so high
(Together) Tell all our friends good-bye
(Together) We will start life new
(Together) This is what we'll do

(Go West) Life is peaceful there
(Go West) In the open air
(Go West) Where the skies are blue
(Go West) This is what we're gonna do

(Go West, this is what we're gonna do, Go West)

(Together) We will love the beach
(Together) We will learn and teach
(Together) Change our pace of life
(Together) We will work and strive
(I love you) I know you love me
(I want you) How could I disagree?
(So that's why) I make no protest
(When you say) You will do the rest

(Go West) Life is peaceful there
(Go West) In the open air
(Go West) Baby you and me
(Go West) This is our destiny
(Go West) Sun in wintertime
(Go West) We will do just fine
(Go West) Where the skies are blue
(Go West, this is what we're gonna do)

There where the air is free
we'll be (We'll be) what we want to be
Now if we make a stand
we'll find (We'll find) our promised land

(I know that) There are many ways
(To live there) In the sun or shade
(Together) We will find a place
(To settle) Where there's so much space
(Without rush) And the pace back East
(The hustling) Rustling just to feed
(I know I'm) Ready to leave too
(So that's what) We are gonna do

(What we're gonna do is
Go West) Life is peaceful there
(Go West) There in the open air
(Go West) Where the skies are blue
(Go West) This is what we're gonna do
(Life is peaceful there) Go West
(In the open air) Go West
(Baby, you and me) Go West
(This is our destiny)
Come on, come on, come on, come on

(Go West) Sun in wintertime
(Go West) We will feel just fine
(Go West) Where the skies are blue
(Go West) This is what we're gonna do
(Come on, come on, come on, come on)

Lyrics:

(All day, all day)

I don't know why, I don't know how
I thought I loved you but I'm not sure now
I've seen you look at strangers too many times
The love you want is of a different kind

Remember when we felt the sun
A love like paradise, how hot it burned
A threat of distant thunder, the sky was red
and where you walked you always turned every head

(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day) Domino dancing
(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day) Domino dancing

I thought that when we fought I was to blame
but now I know you play a different game
I've watched you dance with danger still wanting more
Add another number to the score

(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day) Domino dancing
(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day) Domino dancing

When you look around you wonder
Do you play to win
or are you just a bad loser?

(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day) Domino dancing

I don't know why, I don't know how
I thought I loved you but I'm not sure now
I hear the thunder crashing, the sky is dark
and now a storm is breaking within my heart

(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day) Domino dancing
(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day) Domino dancing

Lyrics:

You always wanted a lover
I only wanted a job
I’ve always worked for my living
How’m I gonna get through?
How’m I gonna get through?

I come here looking for money
(Got to have it)
and end up leaving with love
Now you’ve left me with nothing
(Can’t take it)
How’m I gonna get through?
How’m I gonna get through?

I bought you drinks, I brought you flowers
I read your books and talked for hours
Every day so many drinks
such pretty flowers, so tell me
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I…

Since you went away I’ve been hanging around
I’ve been wondering why I’m feeling down
You went away, it should make me feel better
but I don’t know how I’m gonna get through
How I’m gonna get through

You always wanted me to be something I wasn’t
You always wanted too much
Now I can do what I want to forever
How’m I gonna get through?
How’m I gonna get through?

At night, the people come and go
They talk too fast and walk too slow
Chasing time from hour to hour
I pour the drinks and crush the flowers
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I...

Since you went away I’ve been hanging around
I’ve been wondering why I’m feeling down
You went away, it should make me feel better
but I don’t know how I’m gonna get through
How I’m gonna get through

We don’t have to fall apart, we don’t have to fight
We don’t need to go to hell and back every night
We could make a deal

What have I done to deserve this?

Lyrics:

Check it out, check it out
Here we go - let me say it
Tax on wax make the DJs wanna play it
The front to the front
And the back to the back
The hip to the hop
And the rhyme to the rap
Every single line on the time you admire
Stays in your brain like earth, wind and fire
Here I am all the time, girl, you know me
I must admit, I'm the real Brother Louie!

You're no good, can't you see
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love - set you free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart 
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing

Lyrics: 
You’ve always told me 
That you know me 
But you don’t really know me at all
You just played me and betrayed me 
And showed no sympathy at all

Why can’t you just please surrender
Surrender what you promised
Surrender what I need
Why can’t you just see that sweet surrender in me
one time…  Surrender to me

So will you stand tall, and be accountable, 
and tell that little girl you lied?
How you lost it
I’m so exhausted 
and this is where I draw the line
For the last time

I’m done wasting time
I’m so sick of your lies 
And every time you seem to change your mind
Manipulate - So quick to hate
A true master of your art you demonstrate
But I need a break from you
I need to separate from you
I need to keep my faith and do all the other things I promised to
Why you always make me wait on you
I really need a break from you
I need to keep my faith and do all the other things I promised to
I really need a break!

Director: Paris Visone

O Leãozinho
(Caetano Veloso)

Gosto muito de te ver, leãozinho
Caminhando sob o sol
Gosto muito de você, leãozinho

Para desentristecer, leãozinho
O meu coração tão só
Basta eu encontrar você no caminho

Um filhote de leão, raio da manhã
Arrastando o meu olhar como um ímã
O meu coração é o sol, pai de toda cor
Quando ele lhe doura a pele ao léu

Gosto de te ver ao sol, leãozinho
De te ver entrar no mar
Tua pele, tua luz, tua juba

Gosto de ficar ao sol, leãozinho
De molhar minha juba
De estar perto de você e entrar no mar

E quando eu estiver triste

Quando eu estiver louco
Subitamente se afaste
Quando eu estiver fogo
Suavemente se encaixe

E quando eu estiver triste
Simplesmente me abrace
E quando eu estiver louco
Subitamente se afaste
E quando eu estiver bobo
Sutilmente disfarce
Mas quando eu estiver morto
Suplico que não me mate, não
Dentro de ti, dentro de ti

Mesmo que o mundo acabe, enfim
Dentro de tudo que cabe em ti
Mesmo que o mundo acabe, enfim
Dentro de tudo que cabe em ti

E quando eu estiver triste
Simplesmente me abrace
E quando eu estiver louco
Subitamente se afaste
E quando eu estiver bobo

Mas quando eu estiver morto
Suplico que não me mate, não
Dentro de ti, dentro de ti

Letras:

Bem mais que o tempo
Que nós perdemos
Ficou pra trás
Também o que nos juntou

Ainda lembro
Que eu estava lendo
Só prá saber
O que você achou
Dos versos que eu fiz
E ainda espero
Resposta

Desfaz o vento
O que há por dentro
Desse lugar
Que ninguém mais pisou

Você está vendo
O que está acontecendo
Nesse caderno
Sei que ainda estão

Os versos seus
Tão meus que peço
Nos versos meus
Tão seus que esperem
Que os aceite
