Como Panas - Bryant Myers (letra)

[Intro]
(Te puse de pantalla en el cel
En mi cabeza t√∫ das vuelta' como carrusel)

[Coro]
Todo pas√≥‚ÄÖas√≠‚ÄÖde la nada
Poquito‚ÄÖa poco se fue encendiendo una‚ÄÖllama
Contigo me envolv√≠, yo ni me lo esperaba
Desde que te prob√©, mami, yo me enchul√©
Todo comenz√≥ como pana'
Contigo encontr√© to' lo que buscaba
Beb√©, t√∫ me hechizaste como un hada
Desde que te prob√©, mami, yo me enchul√©

[Verso 1]
(Millo Gang)
Te puse de pantalla en el cel
Enchulao' como Alex Rodri est√° de Jennifer
Te pinto el mundo de colore' sin usar pincel
En mi cabeza t√∫ das vuelta' como carrusel
Nunca te vaya', no har√© ninguna falla
Beb√©, t√∫ te ganaste la medalla
En mi coraz√≥n brincaste la muralla
Voy a luchar por ti, nunca tirar√© la toalla
El que te toque se guaya, le prendo la metralla
Aquel te dej√≥ fr√≠a como el Himalaya
Yo voy a hacer que te olvide' de ese canalla
Contigo siempre voy a correr por la raya

[Pre-Coro]
Mami, t√∫ hace' que sea otro yo
Saca' lo mejor de m√≠, t√∫ hace' que sea otro yo
T√∫ me provoca', yo me dejo llevar
Eso no e' normal, pierdo el control cuando me toca'
No lo puedo evitar, me empiezo a erizar, t√∫ besas cabr√≥n

[Coro]
Todo pas√≥ as√≠ de la nada
Poquito a poco se fue encendiendo una llama
Contigo me envolv√≠, yo ni me lo esperaba
Desde que te prob√©, mami, yo me enchul√©
Todo comenz√≥ como pana' (Pana')
Contigo encontr√© to' lo que buscaba
Beb√©, t√∫ me hechizaste como un hada
Desde que te prob√©, mami, yo me enchul√©

[Verso 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No hay otra como t√∫-√∫, t√∫ me da' lu', lu'
Yo estoy pa' ti full, babe, I don't wanna' lose you
Enchula'o, sin mirar pa'l la'o
Nadie me hab√≠a puesto as√≠, contigo me quedo enjaula'o
T√∫ eres mi rub√≠, en la cama ver movie'
Somos inseparable' como Shaggy y Scooby
Como Buzz Light y Woody, pa' m√≠ t√∫ ere' exclusive
Baby, con las otra' nunca, pero t√∫ si (Siempre)

[Pre-Coro]
T√∫ hace' que sea otro yo
Saca' lo mejor de m√≠, t√∫ hace' que sea otro yo
T√∫ me provoca', yo me dejo llevar, eso no e' normal
Pierdo el control cuando me toca', no lo puedo evitar
Me empiezo a erizar, t√∫ besas cabr√≥n
(Yeah, yeah, you, yo forever, yeah, yeah, girl, you, yo forever yeah, yeah)

[Coro]
Todo pas√≥ as√≠ de la nada
Poquito a poco se fue encendiendo una llama
Contigo me envolv√≠, yo ni me lo esperaba
Desde que te prob√©, mami, yo me enchul√©

Lyrics:
I just looked at my wrist I got time today 
Fuck it I‚Äôm crossing the line today 
The hate be so real the love be fake 
Be bumping they gums and bumping my tape 
Don‚Äôt go against me then ask for my help 
Go get out ya feelings and get it yaself 
Might got the same shoes but you ain‚Äôt gone step 
That shit that you just put out you could have kept 
 
Yup, she gotta nigga he gotta share (why) 
You can‚Äôt compete where you can‚Äôt compare (period)
She ate the dick through my underwear (ugh) 
Got up and got herself outta der‚Äô
I see they put me on memes and things 
Don‚Äôt speak on my life without knowing the real 
8 figures a year what it cost me to live 
Don‚Äôt hold it just say what you feel 
But watch yo mouth fo‚Äô I fly out ya bitch 
(where) to a place that she didn‚Äôt know exist
Mediterranean water my wrist
Keeping em‚Äô pissed how I‚Äôm talking my shit 
Six figure check for a show man I‚Äôm lit
Let‚Äôs celebrate now my bag legit (let‚Äôs go)
These niggas with me wit wateva‚Äô I‚Äôm with 
Didn‚Äôt know who did it got erbody hit, Bitch 
 
Ion like niggas, ion like bitches, ion like nobody 
We can get gangsta, we can keep it cordial 
How you wanna go bout it (how you wanna do it)
Ion back track, man fuck dat ion miss nobody (ion miss nuthin)
Left it on scene ion, aim right back, ion trust nobody 
 
I just looked at my wrist I got time today 
Fuck it I‚Äôm crossing the line today 
These bitches a cry and be lyin in ya face
Slicker than us gotta know how they play 
If the money wasn‚Äôt straight she wouldn‚Äôt be here today 
Ain‚Äôt it man, sure know what to say 
You ain‚Äôt me so it‚Äôs hard to relate
How much cash I fuck off everyday (big bag) 
 
Don‚Äôt play with me baby go play with ya pussy 
You seen him in person these niggas be shooken
A huncho it cost you a Quavo to book me 
I‚Äôm worth it the proof in the pudding
Surrounded by bitches (fo of em)
I‚Äôm looking like William but that ain‚Äôt my girlfriends 
Bro and them done spin on ya block back to back 
When they finish it look like the world end 
I ain‚Äôt ask for it they did it to me 
Niggas exposing they hands for free
Get caught in the middle that‚Äôs bullseye (you can get it to) 
You got hit but we were targeting he (him) 
Popping my shit with a capital P 
SRT red r red key (vroom) 
Might be ugly but my bitch precious (bad) 
She ain‚Äôt even sneeze but still I bless her (ahchoo)
 
Ion like niggas, ion like bitches, ion like nobody 
We can get gangsta, we can keep it cordial 
How you wanna go bout it (how you wanna do it)

Tay Keith fuck these n*ggas up

See wat I‚Äôm sayin (sayin)
I‚Äôma make em see wat I‚Äôm sayin
First they want smoke now they just playin
N*ggas real hoes, know wat I‚Äôm sayin
Dat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm sayin
See wat I‚Äôm sayin
I‚Äôma make em see wat I‚Äôm sayin
Tryna f*ck me soon as I land
Turned her out she rep my brand

Go
Four b*tches can fit in the Phantom
I be with Baby when I‚Äôm in Atlanta
Since I got money they calling me handsome
I fell in love with this girl she a dancer
Ugh , I think her name was Breanna
I get mad at the hoe blocked her number
Head was trash so I had to dump her
Left her a**‚Äôd out like Madonna

Go
Get it in by the load break it down sell it whole
Either way I‚Äôm doing numbers (real sh*t)
20 M‚Äôs to the good I need some more
Tryna buss the clock for a Honda M‚Äôs
Smashing this nasty lil b*tch I hit from the back, pulling her frontal
Every day I can give it, I‚Äôm really too humble
F*ck it I‚Äôm shirt and top off for the summer
Gave It

I‚Äôma make em see wat I‚Äôm sayin (visual)
Hopping out the jet with them bands (typical)
Load up the Drac leave em laying (critical)
Gloc with a switch in yo hand (finish em)
I know a b*tch got more money than her baby daddy
N*gga just sad (pitiful)
I know a click got more reppers than steppers
1 gone shoot sumn maybe outta 10 of em

I‚Äôma make em see wat I‚Äôm sayin
First they want smoke now they just playin
N*ggas real h*es, know wat I‚Äôm sayin
Dat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm sayin
See wat I‚Äôm sayin
I‚Äôma make em see wat I‚Äôm sayin
Tryna f*ck me soon as I land
Turned her out she rep my brand

Go
What should I go get next
Paint job wet on the new blue Vette
Cup full of purple I f*ck with the set
Counting pink 50‚Äôs on a all black jet
Orange HellCat when I wanna stand out
Red & black Rolls when I wanna kick back
5 rings on never gotta hand out
Snuck percs on a plane with a pack of Tic-Taks (I Skated)
One thing about dude he gone give it he in his bag (too deep)
Put this sh*t together like Chinese letters sauce on the walk up (ooh wee)
Know she get around she think I‚Äôm green
Talm bout she falling to deep
Yo time has expired 14 days b*tch yo game too weak

Why they feel like they can play with you Bagg
N*ggas want smoke til that fire on they a**
Tell em pop out with they put up a** (please)
Want some get back I‚Äôm more mad than sad
Talk ya a** off (speak)
Ain‚Äôt no n*gga doing what they say when they facing me
A see me and get little run off four flats taking off like they racing me (poom gone)

See wat I‚Äôm sayin (sayin)

N*ggas real h*es, know wat I‚Äôm sayin

Lyrics:
HOOK:
I aint ever ran from a nigga, If I did cut my legs off.
I aint ever been with the hoe talk, snitch talk. Always talking about his fault.
Yea I'm a stand up nigga, got my bands up nigga. You don't wanna see me pissed off.
Never tell a lie to a bitch dog. When it come to them ya gotta play it raw.
And I never ever let the fuckery get to me. Niggas ain't worth my energy.
Cut em off make em feel it. I aint dealing with nothing if it don't make sense to me.
I never ever ever ever go against my kind for some niggas on the other side
I never ever ever ever put a bitch before the money. Gotta get it when it come to mine.
 
VERSE 1:
Lately I feel like its me vs me. Don't see competition why would you compete.
Don't even gotta be woke, still gonna be up. I make a bag in my sleep.
Cant get the hood outta me. You know where I be. Still posted up like I lease.
Trust me those choppers gonna bang. Cavity teeth, you better not think this shit sweet.
If the bitch bad put a stack in her rack. Im Dr Suess, Give me cat in the hat.
Booty poke out and her stomach on snatch. Way to pretty to be fucked from the back.
Count up some money then smoke me a plant. This shit got me higher than drama rent.
Tash dat little bitch and she knowing she that. I said I was done, still doubled back.
If you a side bitch you can not question me. You did some foul shit. You threw a tech at me.
Cook it up right, they done gave me the recipe. Im in the Z06, police aint catching me.
Im still ducking this bitch dats obsessed with me. Cause Im the dope like the coke in the 70's.
Big Body double R truck I got Bo with me. Hog up the lane and they can't get close to me.
 
HOOK:
I aint ever ran from a nigga, If I did cut my legs off.
I aint ever been with the hoe talk, snitch talk. Always talking about his fault.
Yea I'm a stand up nigga, got my bands up nigga. You don't wanna see me pissed off.
Never tell a lie to a bitch dog. When it come to them ya gotta play it raw.
And I never ever let the fuckery get to me. Niggas ain't worth my energy.
Cut em off make em feel it. I aint dealing with nothing if it don't make sense to me.
I never ever ever ever go against my kind for some niggas on the other side
I never ever ever ever put a bitch before the money. Gotta get it when it come to mine.
 
VERSE 2:
Check the thermostat, Ive been hot all summer. Try me you get whacked make it hard for ya momma
Moneybagg Runtz in the pack, get a bundle. Plaque and the sack, both of em doing numbers.
I aint got a heart for a hoe. Thats a big no. No life worrying about the next hoe.
Took back the keys to the Benzo. All in her feelings throwing clothes out the window.
Lets take a AK cut in half and call it a drako. Im back one my old ways.Riding with that fire Call it that fuego.
Life insurance on my chain. Reach for it, bust your brain. Loose noodle, no lo mein. Going out he way I came.
 
HOOK:

Lyrics:
Yeah I kinda put the cup down for a minute but um 
But honestly it ain‚Äôt nobodies business what‚Äôs in my cup 
What‚Äôs in your cup, what‚Äôs in their cup 
It‚Äôs your cup drink it 
So whateva the hell was in my cup 
The only reaction I did was got more popular
More successful did a lot more things that I‚Äôve ever done 
I probably should pick that cup back up 

I‚Äôm sitting here looking at Kiesha like do you love me do you love me not 
Damn you hit the spot 
Taste like candy, sweet like fruit 
Wet like water, can I love on you 
Withdrawls I‚Äôm feeling different every day I need a dose
Every now and then I‚Äôm missing I got my times when I got ghost 
But she mine, I‚Äôm stamping her, priority status so them other bitches mad at her (too mad, aha)
Coming through a hunnid thou
I spent that on times 2 on you 
Called myself couldn‚Äôt get loose on you 
Then I pop back up like peek-a-boo
Here I go, flyer than most Louis V coat
Gas station coffee cup full ion drive boats (nope)
Money can‚Äôt buy happiness but she found love inside a G 
Head and something to eat that‚Äôs all a thug nigga need 
No lie you get me higher than the prices of me weed
I‚Äôm displaying my feelings like I‚Äôm wearing them on my sleeves

One minute I‚Äôm done with you the next one I be running back 
Go yo way I go my way but some how we be still attached 
Tryna found my answers with this cup but ain‚Äôt no truth in that 
They be like I‚Äôm dumb for fucking with you I spent stupid racks 
I‚Äôm sitting here knowing ion need ya pouring O‚Äôs in the lid
Sipping chasers with my reefa, can‚Äôt get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings she my therapist I‚Äôma talk to this cup

Ring around the rose-z cup full of o-z
I hope I don‚Äôt ode, she keep saying pour me 
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (devil) 
Fuck me like you miss me it‚Äôs been a whole week 
This ain‚Äôt no playground love we grown (too grown)
I‚Äôm too fucked up I pay four hunnid for a zone (that‚Äôs strong)
My bitch don‚Äôt like you you been fucking up my zone (in my house)
Relapsing  every time I try to leave you lone (I relapse)
Every nigga in the streets looking for her but she rare
Dark skin purple hair stingy with her hard to share
Never needed nobody but it feel good to 
Have somebody that somebody 
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it 
This shit toxic 
Let me know if you feel me 
Hmmm hmmm
I gotta stop it, I must stop it 

One minute I‚Äôm done with you the next one I be running back 
Go yo way I go my way but some how we be still attached 
Tryna found my answers with this cup but ain‚Äôt no truth in that 
They be like I‚Äôm dumb for fucking with you I spent stupid racks 
I‚Äôm sitting here knowing ion need ya pouring O‚Äôs in the lid
Sipping chasers with my reefa, can‚Äôt get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup

Do better, who better, you better
Been around, like hella propellers
Wanna know, who you with, don‚Äôt tell em
Come on fellas, that aint none of your biz
Got on your body suit you know I‚Äôm on your ass today
Would you let me hit it thrice if I asked today
She know my stick nothing but magic babe
I be swinging it back and forth till you in your casket bae, mm
Girl you on my best side, mm
But she from the westside, mm mm

Now I just wanna know, don‚Äôt you sugarcoat
I‚Äôll say it all if you won‚Äôt 
Now could you tell me like it is, pretty little fears
Music to my ears

Ok, Say it loud, say it proud, you want it more
We open door, hit the couch, then the floor
I cut it up, like a scissor (SZA), love galore
She never bored, there‚Äôs so much shit we can do
You free to say whatever baby if you askin me
No limit when I‚Äôm in it, got a master p
I‚Äôm hoping I don‚Äôt have a fast release
Got me focused like I‚Äôm out here trynna get my Masters see, mm
Throwin up the peace sign, mm, girl I‚Äôm from the eastside, mmm mm
Girl you on my best side, mm
say she from the westside, mm mm

Now I just wanna know, don‚Äôt you sugarcoat
I‚Äôll say it all if you won‚Äôt 
Now could you tell me like it is, pretty little fears
Music to my ears
Now I just wanna know, don‚Äôt you sugarcoat
I‚Äôll say it all if you won‚Äôt 
Now could you tell me like it is, pretty little fears
Music to my ears

I‚Äôm lovin your light, vulnerable
Lettin your guard down, its honorable
Especially when, the past ain‚Äôt been that
Friendly to you, but, theres magic in that
You the flower that I gotta protect
To keep alive in the wintertime aye don‚Äôt you die yet
You been way more than a friend of mine we more like fam
I raise you, you raise me, let‚Äôs turn this whole life round
You can, confide in me
I could take that weight up off your shoulder blades and try to store the pain inside of me
Like why the world do you like that
Like they don‚Äôt know you God sent but me I view you like that
I‚Äôm sneakin glances thankin god that he drew you like that
Beautiful black child, come and share your black cloud
For your vibe and your smile I don‚Äôt mind a lil rain
I‚Äôm your dog ears, perk up at the sound of your name
Count on your main wildfire can‚Äôt handle your flame
Download your strain wild high, come drown in your fragrance
You that red pill that a nigga found in the matrix
Before I had you this shit was fantasy, you plant a seed
To grow some roots a branch and leaves becomes a tree of life
Until our nights are filled with peace from stress and strife
And that‚Äôs the blessing that I get from wifin you cause you
Entrust in me with the key to your heart, beating you smart
Cause even though I need a new start
Due to my past transgressions you believed in me
I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, Lord
Say she from the westside mmmm
And she seen my best side, mmmm mmm

Now I just wanna know, don‚Äôt you sugarcoat
I‚Äôll say it all if you won‚Äôt 
Now could you tell me like it is, pretty little fears
Music to my ears

Lyrics
Forever feat 6lack

Passwords 
That means you love me 
I can give you what you ask for 
Say you need a shooter 
I can do it from the half court 
I can change your life up
Painting murals on your passport (Louie)
Future kids all on the dashboard 
Ooo
I like every flaw I see in ya
This is all new
But I hope I got what you need too 
(I hope I got what you need)

Cause sometimes somebody loves somebody 
But that body don‚Äôt love ‚Äòem back 
And it‚Äôs easy to say that you didn‚Äôt know
You didn‚Äôt know what you had 
But you don‚Äôt 
You‚Äôre educated 
You know 
That they don‚Äôt make ‚Äòem 
Like me 
Any more
So you pull me in close 
And say 

Stay
Forever 
(I think you should put your bag down you should never leave)
Baby you should stay forever  
(I think you should put your bag down you should never leave)
Baby you should stay 
Forever ah ah ah ah ah ah
Forever ah ah ah ah ah
Forever ah ah ah ah ah ah
Forever ah ah ah ah ah

Passwords passports 
Imma have to treat you like a landlord 
I want you to stay 
Stay the moment 
Got to put it on cam-cord
She a all star porn star 
Throw it up and catch it off the back board
I‚Äôm give you everything that you asked for 
Like you kick down the door on some task force shit 
Credit card numbers four-digit pin social security 
You could be happy you should be happy 
Long as you here with me 
They could never give get between us 
Said we would never ever leave us 
That was a while ago 

Now sometimes somebody loves somebody 
But that body don‚Äôt love ‚Äòem back 
And it‚Äôs easy to say that you didn‚Äôt know
You didn‚Äôt know what you had 
But you don‚Äôt 
You‚Äôre educated 
You know 
That they don‚Äôt make ‚Äòem 
Like me 
Any more
So you pull me in close 
And say 

Stay
Forever 
(I think you should put your bag down you should never leave)
Baby you should stay forever  
(I think you should put your bag down you should never leave)
Baby you should stay 
  
Forever ah ah ah ah ah ah
Forever ah ah ah ah ah
Forever ah ah ah ah ah ah
Forever ah ah ah ah ah

'Queen & Slim: The Soundtrack‚Äô Available Now 
Film in Theaters November 27 

From trailblazing, Emmy-winning writer Lena Waithe (Netflix‚Äôs Master of None) and Melina Matsoukas, the visionary director of some of this generation‚Äôs most powerful pop-culture experiences, including Beyonce‚Äôs ‚ÄúFormation‚Äù and the Nike ‚ÄúEquality‚Äù campaign, comes Makeready‚Äôs unflinching new drama, Queen & Slim. While on a forgettable first date together in Ohio, a black man (Get Out‚Äôs Daniel Kaluuya) and a black woman (Jodie Turner-Smith, in her first starring feature-film role), are pulled over for a minor traffic infraction. The situation escalates, with sudden and tragic results, when the man kills the police officer in self-defense. Terrified and in fear for their lives, the man, a retail employee, and the woman, a criminal defense lawyer, are forced to go on the run. But the incident is captured on video and goes viral, and the couple unwittingly become a symbol of trauma, terror, grief and pain for people across the country. As they drive, these two unlikely fugitives will discover themselves and each other in the most dire and desperate of circumstances, and will forge a deep and powerful love that will reveal their shared humanity and shape the rest of their lives. Joining a legacy of films such as Bonnie and Clyde and Thelma & Louise, Queen & Slim is a powerful, consciousness-raising love story that confronts the staggering human toll of racism and the life-shattering price of violence. Waithe wrote the script based on an original idea by bestselling author James Frey (A Million Little Pieces, Katerina). The feature-film directorial debut from Melina Matsoukas (executive producer of HBO‚Äôs Insecure) stars Academy Award¬Æ nominee Daniel Kaluuya as ‚ÄúSlim‚Äù and rising star Jodie Turner-Smith (Syfy‚Äôs Nightflyers), as ‚ÄúQueen.‚Äù Waithe produces the film via her company, Hillman Grad Productions, along with Matsoukas via her production company, De La Revoluci√≥n Films. Frey produces via his production company, 3BlackDot, alongside Andrew Coles and Michelle Knudsen.

Lyrics:
If we could take a photo
Eternalize this moment
For the days when I don't believe
When our love gets stolen
'Cause there's no exception
And I know time will take you far from me
Let this night invade my lungs
You're all I wanna breathe
Right beside the lake, I burn for you
You burn for me
So kiss me the way that you would
If we died tonight
Hold me the way that you would
For the final time
Whatever may come, somewhere deep inside
There's always this version of you and I
So just kiss me the way that you would
If we died tonight, if we died tonight, yeah
All the deepest secrets
All the darkest moments
Oh, I promise they'll be safe with me
We've all been broken
There's no exception
But you carry it so gracefully
Let this night invade my lungs
You're all I want to breathe
Right beside the lake, I burn for you
You burn for me
So kiss me the way that you would
If we died tonight
Hold me the way that you would
For the final time, yeah
Whatever may come, somewhere deep inside
There's always this version of you and I
So just kiss me the way that you would
If we died tonight, if we died tonight, yeah
So I let this night in my lungs
You're all that I wanna breathe
Right beside you, down at the lake
I burn for you, burn for me, mm
So kiss me the way that you would
If we died tonight
And hold me the way that you would
For the final time, yeah
Whatever may come, somewhere deep inside
There's always this version of you and I
So just kiss me the way that you would
If we died tonight, if we died tonight, yeah
If we died tonight, yeah
Oh, oh
If we died tonight, yeah

LYRICS

I wanna be king in your story
I wanna know who you are
I want your heart to be for me
Oh I,

Want you to sing to me softly
‚ÄòCause then I‚Äôm outrunning the dark
That‚Äôs all that love ever taught me

Call and I‚Äôll rush out
All out of breath now

You‚Äôve got that power over me
My my
Everything I hold dear resides in those eyes
You‚Äôve got that power over me
My my
The only one I know, the only one on my mind

Remember the lake in the moonlight?
Remember you shivered and shone? 
I‚Äôll never forget what you looked like
On that night

And I know that time‚Äôs gonna take me
I know that day‚Äôs gonna come
I just want the devil to hate me
Oh I,

Call and I‚Äôll rush out
All out of breath now

You‚Äôve got that power over me
My my
Everything I hold dear resides in those eyes
You‚Äôve got that power over me
My my
The only one I know, the only one on my mind

It was all in doubt,
They were all around.

So we‚Äôll hide away and never tell
You decide if darkness knows you well
That lesson of love, all that it was
I need you to see

You‚Äôve got that power over me
My my
Everything I hold dear resides in those eyes
You‚Äôve got that power over me
My my
The only one I know, the only one on my mind.

‚ÄòSomething to Someone‚Äô Lyrics: 

There‚Äôs lessons in love sometimes¬†
The heart is but a winding road,
So this story goes.

I get scared of the dark and I,
I never even noticed rooms
Were made bright by you.

Oh you loved me more than anyone,
Yea we were up so high¬†

We were lost when we were young but,¬†
You were mine

Once upon a time
You were by my side
I wish I could‚Äôve known¬†
That I should hold on tight¬†
To every single word¬†
To every summer night
I wish I could‚Äôve known¬†
That forever was a lie¬†

But once upon a time¬†
I was something to someone¬†
Once upon a time¬†
I was something to someone¬†

See your shape under gold street lights
But every time I‚Äôm close you move¬†
And I‚Äôm just left with the truth¬†

Oh you loved me more than anyone,
Yea we were up so high¬†

We were lost when we were young but,¬†
You were mine

Once upon a time
You were by my side
I wish I could‚Äôve known¬†
That I should hold on tight¬†
To every single word¬†
To every summer night
I wish I could‚Äôve known¬†
That forever was a lie¬†

But once upon a time¬†
I was something to someone¬†
Once upon a time¬†
I was something to someone¬†

Something to you
Something to you¬†

Once upon a time
You were by my side
I wish I could‚Äôve known¬†
That I should hold on tight¬†
To every single word¬†
To every summer night
I wish I could‚Äôve known¬†
That forever was a lie¬†

But once upon a time¬†
I was something to someone¬†
Once upon a time¬†
I was something to someone¬†

Something to you
Something to you¬†

üé§  Lyrics in full:

When it's not always raining there'll be days like this
When there's no one complaining there'll be days like this
When everything falls into place like the flick of a switch
Well my mama told me there'll be days like this
When you don't need to worry there'll be days like this
When no one's in a hurry there'll be days like this
When you don't get betrayed by that old Judas kiss
Oh my mama told me there'll be days like this
When you don't need an answer there'll be days like this
When you don't meet a chancer there'll be days like this
When all the parts of the puzzle start to look like they fit it
Then I must remember there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this
When everyone is up front and they're not playing tricks
When you don't have no freeloaders out to get their kicks
When it's nobody's business the way that you want to live
I just have to remember there'll be days like this
When no one steps on my dreams there'll be days like this
When people understand what I mean there'll be days like this
When you ring out the changes of how everything is
Well my mama told me there'll be days like this
Oh my mama told me
There'll be days like this
Oh my mama told me
There'll be days like this

Lyrics:
Better days are comin'
If no one told you
I hate to hear you cryin'
Over the phone, dear
For seven years runnin'
You've been a soldier
But better days are comin'
Better days are comin' for you
So when the night feels like forever
(Mh-mh)
I'll remember what you said to me
I know you've been hurtin'
Waitin' on a train that just won't come
The rain, it ain't permanent
And soon, we'll be dancin' in the sun
We'll be dancin' in the sun
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
We never miss the flowers
Until the sun's down
We never count the hours
Until they're runnin' out
You're on the other side of the storm now
You should be so proud
And better days are comin'
Better days are comin' for you
So when the night feels like forever
(Mh-mh)
I'll remember what you said to me
I know you've been hurting (is our time ever soothing?)
Waiting on a train that just won't come
The rain, it ain't permanent (is our time ever soothing?)
And soon, we'll be dancing in the sun
We'll be dancing in the sun
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
Your story's gonna change
Just wait for better days
You've seen too much of pain
Now, you don't even know
That your story's gonna change
Just wait for better days
I promise you, I won't let go
I know you've been hurting
Waiting on a train that just won't come
The rain, it ain't permanent (is our time ever soothing?)
And soon, we'll be dancing in the sun
We'll be dancing in the sun
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)

LYRICS: 

Don't tell me this is all for nothing
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby I'll be out there somewhere

I could've showed you all the scars at the start
But that was always the most difficult part
See I'm in love with how your soul's a mix of chaos and art
And how you never try to keep 'em apart
I wrote some words and then I stared at my feet
Became a coward when I needed to speak
I guess love took on a different kind of meaning for me
So when I go just know it kills me to leave

To all the stars that light the road
Don't ever leave that girl so cold
Never let me down, just lead me home

Don't tell me this is all for nothing
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby I'll be out there somewhere
But there's beauty here that's yet to depart
There's still a song inside the halls in the dark
I'll come for you if you just stay where you are
And I'll always hold your hand in the car

There'll be days when it's difficult
But I ask you to never leave behind the reciprocal, we're past that
Love is not designed for the cynical
So we have that
We can have that

To all the stars that light the road
Don't ever leave that girl so cold
Never let me down, just lead me home

Don't tell me this is all for nothing
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby I'll be out there somewhere

How long can you wait for the one you deserve
Fight on
Never let it out
Never let it out

I'm gone
If you ever leave I hope that you learn to fight on
To fight on 

Don't tell me this is all for nothing
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby I'll be out there somewhere

Asides from everyone else getting absolutely llllliiiiccked while I stayed basically sober. It also jus kinda became about a different thing to what I thought. Like I thought it was gonna be about when you‚Äôre somewhere but your mind jus totally isn‚Äôt and your on a totally different tip to everyone else. 

üéâ üéâ üéâ 

But like you can see in the last shot the way they literally pulllll me out of whatever I‚Äôm in, that it kinda became about letting people do for you when you need it. At least to me. Like it rreeallllyyy felt like that and they all randomly started singin ‚ÄòI pray for yoouuuuu‚Äô over and over and I was tryna stay lookin all down and serious n shit but it jus wasn‚Äôt possible anymorrrreee. So yeah let the people you love pull you out of whatever it is guys.

[Verse 1]
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it, maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

[Chorus]
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Bridge]
No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

LYRICS
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you and you've got to

Make it on your own but, we don't have to grow up, we can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola, underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going and you know that

All you have to do is stay
A minute
Just take
Your time
The clock
Is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait
A second
Your hands, on mine
The clock is ticking
So stay

Won‚Äôt admit what I already know
I‚Äôve never been the best at letting go
I don‚Äôt wanna spend the night alone
Yes I need you
And I need to

Make it on my own but, I don't wanna grow up, we can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola, underneath the rising sun
I could give a million reasons why
But you're going and you know that

All you have to do is stay
A minute
Just take
Your time
The clock
Is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait
A second
Your hands, on mine
The clock is ticking
So stay

All you have to do is stay
All you have to do is stay
So stay
Yeah

All you have to do is stay
A minute
Just take
Your time
The clock
Is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait
A second
Your hands, on mine
The clock is ticking
So stay

(verse 1)
I won‚Äôt tell you I‚Äôm lonely
‚Äòcause it may be selfish
I won‚Äôt ask you to hold me
‚Äòcause that won‚Äôt mend what‚Äôs helpless

(pre-chorus)
there‚Äôs not a thing
I could say
not a song I could sing
for your mind to change
nothing can fill up the space
won‚Äôt ask you to stay
but let me ask you one thing

(chorus)
oh, oh, oh when did you fall out of love?
out of love
oh, oh, oh when did you fall out of love
with me?

(verse 2)
I can‚Äôt float in an ocean
that‚Äôs already been drained
I won‚Äôt cry at your feet now 
I know my tears will fall in vain 

(pre-chorus) x2

(bridge)
no use wondering 
why your changing heart has wandered
so I‚Äôll ask you this question
‚Äòcause it might help me sleep longer

(chorus) x2

out of love, out of love, out of love
with me

For centuries, the greatest sailors in the world masterfully navigated the vast Pacific, discovering the many islands of Oceania. But then, 3,000 years ago, their voyages stopped for a millennium ‚Äì and no one knows exactly why. From Walt Disney Animation Studios comes ‚ÄúMoana,‚Äù a sweeping, CG-animated feature film about an adventurous teenager who is inspired to leave the safety and security of her island on a daring journey to save her people. Inexplicably drawn to the ocean, Moana (voice of Auli ªi Cravalho) convinces the mighty demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson) to join her mission, and he reluctantly helps her become a wayfinder like her ancestors who sailed before her. Together, they voyage across the open ocean on an action-packed adventure, encountering enormous monsters and impossible odds, and along the way, Moana fulfills her quest and discovers the one thing she‚Äôs always sought: her own identity. Directed by the renowned filmmaking team of Ron Clements and John Musker (‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid,‚Äù ‚ÄúAladdin,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Princess & the Frog‚Äù), produced by Osnat Shurer (‚ÄúLifted,‚Äù ‚ÄúOne Man Band‚Äù), and featuring music by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa‚Äòi, ‚ÄúMoana‚Äù sailed into U.S. theaters on Nov. 23, 2016.

‚ÄúWild Things‚Äù Lyrics

Find table space
Say your social graces
Bow your head, they're pious here
But you and I, we're pioneers
We make our own rules
Our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are sellin'
There are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now
We'll rebel rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs
To those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves
So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be alright
Don't mind us
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in crowd
The cool kids aren't cool to me
They're not cooler than we are
We will carve our place into time and space
We will find our way, or we'll make a way, say hey, hey, hey
Find you're great, don't you hide your face
And let it shine, shine, shine, shine

Music video by Alessia Cara performing Wild Things. (C) 2016 Def Jam Recordings, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.

Chorus:
And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine

'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
And I see forever in your eyes
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile

Wishing on dandelions all of the time
Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time

Lyrics:
And I don't mean to be selfish
But my heart breaks every time
That I see you smile
'Cause I know that it's not me
Who brings it out of you anymore
You found somebody new
You put me in the past
I don't even know if our memories will last
But if by chance it doesn't work out with her
You'll always have a chance with me in my world

Lyrics:
Never sleep ft travis Scott and lil baby 

Geeked never sleep
Stretch a hundred to millions in weeks
Got her running and riding for me
Where it‚Äôs sunny we gotta retreat
Straight from London she out in the east
Let her shop and she keep the receipts 
Don‚Äôt you tell him you got it from me
After this ima need therapy 

‚ÄúTravis Scott verse‚Äù
I been building up my legacy 
Hunnits on hunnits on fold
I been up so far 
Somewhere stuck at the top 
And it‚Äôs nowhere to go 
I was just thinking like damn to get a new drop so I can circle the floor
I was just thinking like damn some niggas got crop I gotta circle to grow
Soon as we land we make it go pop
Gave her a grand she turn it to snot
Got with her man a nigga got blocked
Give her a tan I‚Äôm already hot
I gave her the land the sand and all of the views
And really all you did is plot 
I gave you the plans and brands all the jewels and really all you do is flop

‚ÄúNav hook‚Äù
Geeked never sleep
Stretch a hundred to millions in weeks
Got her running and riding for me
Where it‚Äôs sunny we gotta retreat
Straight from London she out in the east
Let her shop and she keep the receipts 
Don‚Äôt you tell him you got it from me
After this ima need therapy 

‚ÄúTravis Scott hook‚Äù
I been building up my legacy 
Hunnits on hunnits on fold
I been up so far 
Somewhere stuck at the top 
And it‚Äôs nowhere to go 

‚ÄúLil baby verse‚Äù
I‚Äôm from the streets 
They remember me
Lil Dominique 
Ima dog don‚Äôt deny it at all
Na foreal keep your bitch on a leash
Why you tryna compete with me know you can‚Äôt see me
I got the hardest then I press repeat
Give a head start and they still ain‚Äôt gone beat me
Birthday some shit that they can‚Äôt see on TV
Pull up inside a mclaren like beep beep
I took a half of a E now I‚Äôm geekin
Put her on camera I‚Äôm never gone leak it
Keep that shit classy when you see me don‚Äôt speak to me
Get her away from me that‚Äôs where she need to be
Switch the Mercedes sign out for a **
I pay them all they lil fee it don‚Äôt bother me
I‚Äôm all on top of this Shit cause I gotta be 

‚ÄúNav hook‚Äù
Geeked never sleep
Stretch a hundred to millions in weeks
Got her running and riding for me
Where it‚Äôs sunny we gotta retreat
Straight from London she out in the east
Let her shop and she keep the receipts 
Don‚Äôt you tell him you got it from me
After this ima need therapy 

‚ÄúTravis Scott hook‚Äù
I been building up my legacy 
Hunnits on hunnits on fold
I been up so far 
Somewhere stuck at the top 
And it‚Äôs nowhere to go 

‚ÄúNav verse‚Äù
Got 2 rings and they 40 a piece 
Gotta ride with a 40 Atleast 
You invite he she leaving with me
What you pushing there‚Äôs levels to P
I came out the soil I got mud on my cleats 
Ever since run it up I got my money up
I keep all 3 of my bitches on fleek 
Always stay geeked up if I ran into vampires they would get high off the shit that I bleed
If a producer don‚Äôt take off his tag I‚Äôll do it myself and I‚Äôll remake the beat 
When I go shopping I‚Äôm spending the bag it touch the floor when I hold up the receipt 
I been going ghost and my doors on suicide 
Looking in the mirror like I really am that guy 
Still with my gang I don‚Äôt really like to choose sides 
Hope off a jet to check on a red eye 
Roll up the spliff mix the grabba with dead guys
People still hating and I still don‚Äôt know why
4 pockets full put a Molly in a cacti

‚ÄúNav hook‚Äù
Geeked never sleep
Stretch a hundred to millions in weeks
Got her running and riding for me
Where it‚Äôs sunny we gotta retreat
Straight from London she out in the east
Let her shop and she keep the receipts 
Don‚Äôt you tell him you got it from me
After this ima need therapy 

‚ÄúTravis Scott hook‚Äù
I been building up my legacy 
Hunnits on hunnits on fold
I been up so far 
Somewhere stuck at the top 
And it‚Äôs nowhere to go

Lyrics:

I‚Äôm a late bloomer 3rd year on the scene
20 Racks don‚Äôt feel like nothing to me
Came from the streets it turned me to a beast
Invisible set diamonds huggin my piece

Book me for a show I need 80 at least
I want the smoke ain‚Äôt no keeping the peace
Keep me a razor when im in the east
Open em‚Äô up just like a surgery

Everything burnin‚Äô around me im lit
Show a little attitude swapped out a bitch
I spent 250 don‚Äôt know where it went
My hood on my back I gotta represent

Toronto you useless you don‚Äôt have a pull 
Warm that boy up he got shot in the cold
30 rounds in the clip let it unload
I fucked a bitch I picked right out of vogue

Took 20 bitches on my first vacay
I ain‚Äôt pickin up im in Turks lil baby
Every other watch got diamonds in the face
Pullin out acid take a taste lil baby

Pullin out 50 racks walkin outta chase
If I drop dead ill be hard to replace
Hardly get thirsty got water like a lake
My brother got locked another bond I gotta pay
First time in Turks got a whole bunch of work
Got to bring two jets and a whole lot of babes
I first took a game changing verse
With the change gonna hurt but it really ain‚Äôt a game
Shorty like to twerk up in a rage
Really get to trippin on the stage
Never ever let them see the man unless they pay
Niggas havin beef off on what they pray 
Cactus Jack me up and down on the tour
Make sure the ones you with on go
Make sure the ones you with is with it
Make sure the ones you with are
She need a quick tank, I‚Äômma text with the G‚Äôs
More for the body, need more than the grease
Fillin her nose with some shit I can ski with
Haters say the first time is it hard to believe

Took 20 bitches on my first vacay
I ain‚Äôt pickin up im in Turks lil baby
Every other watch got diamonds in the face
Pullin out ass and take a taste lil baby

Pullin out 50 racks walkin outta chase
If I drop dead ill be hard to replace
Hardly get thirsty got water like a lake
My brother got locked another bond I gotta pay

Trappin on the block 
Ill never serve a cop
I always kept the glock
I aint bout to see the grave

Pull up I make quick stop
I shot one stop I don‚Äôt have 7 days
Who is that lil nigga as he hoppin out a wraith
Chopper get it choppin like a blade

You aint get no money but you poppin on your page
Trust me we can never be the same

Know I like to flirt
No skirts in Turks
Im puttin in work
I beat her outta frame

She sweet I move enough perc 
I bought her a Birkin and a birthday cake
Line his ass up let the barber do the fade 
Fed your hoe crepes and grapes
Cash told me don‚Äôt worry there‚Äôs a billion on the way
We just split a billy with the gang

Took 20 bitches on my first vacay
I ain‚Äôt pickin up im in Turks lil baby
Every other watch got diamonds in the face
Pullin out ass and take a taste lil baby

Pullin out 50 racks walkin outta chase
If I drop dead ill be hard to replace
Hardly get thirsty got water like a lake
My brother got locked another bond I gotta pay

Lyrics: 

‚ÄúDon Toliver hook‚Äù
You buy the drink at the bar
You wanna fuck in the car
I‚Äôll show you just who you are
You took a bite of the bar
I guess it‚Äôs right if it‚Äôs wrong
Yea I see
Yea I see
* it‚Äôs a one time hit for a nigga for a nigga like me

‚ÄúNav verse‚Äù
They come in the ceiling when you fucking with a star
Girl just drop a pin I‚Äôm pulling up to where you are
Everything I get it come with options cause I‚Äôm famous
Had a special moment still can‚Äôt tell you what her name is
Plug to your socket let me be the o
ne in charge
I can be your mirror I can show you who you are
Can‚Äôt be seen in public with you I‚Äôm taking a risk
Every time you use your phone I think you being slick
Focus on the moment don‚Äôt know how long we‚Äôll live
I know that shit she going she got tatts on her ribs
There‚Äôs not a lot of people that can do what I did
Damn near suicidal almost slit both my wrists
Soon as I pull up it‚Äôs just as fast as I‚Äôm gone
I been going off don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôll stay on
See it it your eyes you wanna fuck me cause
I‚Äôm lit
I‚Äôll let you decide you gotta make it quick

‚ÄúDon Toliver hook‚Äù
You buy the drink at the bar
You wanna fuck in the car
I‚Äôll show you just who you are
You took a bite of the bar
I guess it‚Äôs right if it‚Äôs wrong
Yea I see
Yea I see
* it‚Äôs a one time hit for a nigga for a nigga like me
Yea I see
Yea I see
* it‚Äôs a one time hit for a nigga for a nigga like me

‚ÄúFuture verse‚Äù
Pretty bon Bon bon bon bon bon
Lucky charm yea yea yea yea
Pressure make diamonds you icy
Maneuver through the trenches so swiftly
Bought a bulletproof to chest solitary
Covered up in chinchillas and LV
All these diamonds on me cured bitch vaccine
One of one when I put it on you girl rare breed
Total loaded fully auto for the world of envy
I‚Äôm going full throttle hitting the gas no ignition
pollution in my cup so I‚Äôm on drugs when I hit it
Like a VIP now you getting head on a mission
Gone off the screw 16 ounces or more
Bitch a mermaid and she dripped out in water
I hit it then she prayed to a
nigga like a god
Cleaning like a maid every time she give me mop
I know my swagga got her always be up to par
Smash on this bitch making money on my day off
Bitch a mermaid and she dripped out in water
I hit it then she prayed to a nigga like a god

‚ÄúDon Toliver hook‚Äù
You buy the drank at the bar
You wanna fuck in the car
I‚Äôll show you just who you are
You took a bite of the bar

* it‚Äôs a one time hit for a nigga for a nigga like me
Yea I see

Letra:
Puro pa delante porque para atr√°s  ya ni para agarrar viada
Yo vengo a sumarle y al que resta ac√° 
Lo abrimos y de volada

Trabajo bastante si supieran que hay noches que yo ni duermo
Pero es importante no ando de okis siempre ando produciendo

Vamos avanzando consciente yo estoy que no estamos donde mismo
Si volteo al pasado es pa tachar lo que
 con esfuerzo he conseguido

La presi√≥n es alta para aquel que busca ser sobresaliente 
Yo vengo de abajo y me exigido tanto que me volv√≠ fuerte

Todas esas veces que implore por mi destino
Mismas veces madrugue por lograr mi objetivo

Porque venimos desde abajo pero vamos para arriba

Puro CT 

Me siento orgulloso de lo que hasta hoy 
en mi vida yo he logrado 

no estoy donde antes vengo muy delante y se que el camino es largo 
por eso si puedo ayudo a la gente que alg√∫n d√≠a me dio la mano

nada es permanente y presente yo tengo la l√≠nea que cargo
Todas esas veces que implore por mi destino
Mismas veces madrugue por lograr mi objetivo

Letra:
Me ven sereno
Traigo buen porte
Y mi deporte
Se a vuelto el hacer dinero 

Se que eso es bueno
Vengo de abajo 
Y con un chingo de trabajo
Fue que consegu√≠ este puesto

Lo mismo valgo
Con billete o sin billete
No me la ando recargando 
Mi palabra me a respaldado 

Tengo fortuna
en esta vida
Ya se acabaron las malas
Hoy las buenas abundaron

Se bien quien soy de donde vengo
Y hacia donde me dirijo 
Las metas est√°n m√°s que claras
Yo aqu√≠ sigo en mi camino
Para cuidarme una cortita la traigo 
Fajada al cinto 
Y no es parte de mi negocio
Gusto personal mi amigo 
Muy serenito se me mira por ah√≠

PERFEITO PRA FICAR SOZINHO
(Elan R√∫bio / Bruno C√©sar)

T√¥ mais paciente, bem mais carinhoso
Agora eu aprendi a me p√¥r no lugar do outro
T√¥ ouvindo mais, t√¥ falando menos
Entendi que √†s vezes quem t√° com a raz√£o
Tem que sair perdendo

Aprendi com a saudade da gente
Tudo que c√™ tentou me ensinar
Pena que o cora√ß√£o s√≥ aprende
Quando √© tarde demais pra voltar

Me tornei esse cara perfeito pra ficar sozinho
Tentando virar a p√°gina
De um amor que j√° trocou de livro

Tem coisas nessa vida que ningu√©m conserta
Uma ta√ßa quebrada, uma folha rasgada
E mulher quando diz que j√° era

Tem coisas nessa vida que ningu√©m conserta
Uma ta√ßa quebrada, uma folha rasgada
E mulher quando diz que j√° era

PINO DA GRANADA
(Clebinho / Alex Alves / Juliano Couto / Wallas Dias)

N√£o √© voc√™, sou eu
√â esse papo que c√™ joga quando quer me jogar fora
Meu beijo percebeu
Que seu abra√ßo √© um n√≥ frouxo e qualquer hora solta

√â um sil√™ncio na casa, uma transa sem gra√ßa
E ningu√©m aqui fala nada
Se t√° esperando esse fim explodir na minha boca
T√¥ tirando o pino da granada

Se eu for problema, hoje eu t√¥ deixando de ser
Se eu for saudade, torce pro meu beijo n√£o sobreviver
E encontrar algu√©m que entre na linha de fogo
E fa√ßa eu te superar

LETRA:
(Fellipe Panda / Luan Sacada / Wallin Sanfoneiro / Luan Rodrigues / Jaffinha compositor / Tom Brito)

Como ta sua primeira noite de solteiro?
Se algu√©m te pedir um beijo
Ser√° que voc√™ vai negar?

Pra piorar ai ta cheio de amigo meu
Acabei de receber aqui um v√≠deo seu 
Com zero apar√™ncia de quem terminou
Mas por favor 

Volta pra casa
Sem batom borrado, sem ningu√©m do lado
Sem contato novo no seu celular 
Se um mal intencionado oferecer carona
Recusa que eu vou te buscar 

E se suas amigas te botarem pilha
Te empurrar bebida pra me esquecer de vez
Recusa os gole, recusa os beijos, respeita seu ex!

Boca Enganada 
(Ricardo Vismarck/ Ronael / Elvis Elan / Henrique Casttro)

Tenha s√≥ um pouquinho de paci√™ncia vai 

Desculpa
Eu p√¥r em d√∫vida teu sentimento 
Meu cora√ß√£o que t√° me segurando, mas eu to querendo

Voc√™ n√£o t√° errando em nada
N√£o falta carinho, sobra amor na cama 
Eu piro no seu jeito
At√© agora n√£o achei defeito
Mas quem me machucou era assim no come√ßo
C√™ n√£o fez nada e t√°‚Äô pagando o pre√ßo 

Boca enganada, beija com medo 
E desconfia das melhores camas, dos melhores beijos 
Voc√™ j√° ganhou o meu lado carente
S√≥ te pe√ßo calma sentimentalmente 

Boca enganada, beija com medo 
E desconfia das melhores camas, dos melhores beijos 
Voc√™ j√° ganhou o meu lado carente
S√≥ te pe√ßo calma sentimentalmente (2x)

Deixa o eu te amo um pouco mais pra frente

Voc√™ n√£o t√° errando em nada

Eu piro no seu jeito

Quando a Chuva Passar / Sem Ar / Meu Bem Querer

Pra que falar
Se voc√™ n√£o quer me ouvir?
Fugir agora n√£o resolve nada
Mas n√£o vou chorar
Se voc√™ quiser partir
√Äs vezes a dist√¢ncia ajuda
E essa tempestade um dia vai acabar

S√≥ quero te lembrar
De quando a gente andava nas estrelas
Nas horas lindas que passamos juntos
A gente s√≥ queria amar e amar e hoje eu tenho certeza
A nossa hist√≥ria n√£o termina agora
Pois essa tempestade um dia vai acabar

Quando a chuva passar
Quando o tempo abrir
Abra a janela e veja eu sou o sol
Eu sou c√©u e mar
Eu sou seu e fim
E o meu amor √© imensid√£o

S√≥ quero te lembrar
De quando a gente andava nas estrelas
Nas horas lindas que passamos juntos
A gente s√≥ queria amar e amar e hoje eu tenho certeza
A nossa hist√≥ria n√£o termina agora
Pois essa tempestade um dia vai acabar

Quando a chuva passar
Quando o tempo abrir
Abra a janela e veja eu sou o sol
Eu sou c√©u e mar
Eu sou seu e fim
E o meu amor √© imensid√£o

Quando a chuva passar
Quando o tempo abrir
Abra a janela e veja eu sou o sol
Eu sou c√©u e mar
Eu sou seu e fim
E o meu amor √© imensid√£o

Meus p√©s n√£o tocam mais o ch√£o
Meus olhos n√£o veem a minha dire√ß√£o
Da minha boca saem coisas sem sentido
Voc√™ era o meu farol e hoje estou perdido

O sofrimento vem √† noite sem pudor
Somente o sono ameniza a minha dor
Mas e depois? E quando o dia clarear?
Quero viver do teu sorriso, teu olhar

Eu corro pro mar pra n√£o lembrar voc√™
E o vento me traz o que eu quero esquecer
Entre os solu√ßos do meu choro eu tento te explicar
Nos teus bra√ßos √© o meu lugar

Contemplando as estrelas, minha solid√£o
Aperta forte o peito, √© mais que uma emo√ß√£o
Esqueci do meu orgulho pra voc√™ voltar
Permane√ßo sem amor, sem luz, sem ar

Uh, uh, uh, baby

Eu ontem tive um sonho
Sonhava que voc√™
Beijava a minha boca, era t√£o bom
Ia deslizando no meu corpo
E me deixando louco
Pena que isso tudo era s√≥ sonho

O qu√™ que eu fa√ßo se √© voc√™ que eu venero
Ainda te amo, meu amor, ainda te quero
Sem voc√™ n√£o vivo nem um segundo
Sem teu amor fico perdido no mundo

Como era bom, amor, te ver sorrindo
Ah, ah, que lindo, que lindo
E ter voc√™, paix√£o pra vida inteira
Te carinhar, minha linda sereia

Vem me dar seu amor
Vem que eu quero voc√™
Meu bem querer 

Vem me dar seu amor
Vem que eu quero voc√™
Meu bem querer

Uh, uh, uh, baby

DOIS ENGANADOS

T√¥ ficando com algu√©m
Que terminou faz pouco tempo
E ainda guarda sentimento
Olha eu aqui tamb√©m, ainda t√¥ me remoendo
Por causa do meu antigo relacionamento

Dois enganados
Dando uma chance pro amor
Eu quero voltar ao passado
E ela sonha em ter de volta
O que j√° passou

E na hora da cama o corpo n√£o aceita
A pele n√£o esquenta
Nem beijar a gente beija
Respiro, fecho os olhos
E j√° que eu n√£o esque√ßo
Lembro de quem eu amo
E s√≥ assim eu compare√ßo

√î√¥√¥h, e quem t√° comigo t√° fazendo o mesmo

DEUS E O MUNDO
(Rodrigo Reys / Elan R√∫bio / Marcello Henrique / Bruno Sucesso)

Voc√™ t√° me pedindo pra eu nao divulgar
Pra fam√≠lia e amigos o real motivo da gente largar
Implorou de joelhos pra n√£o te difamar
Mas na hora da pouca vergonha
Voc√™ n√£o parou pra pensar

N√£o pensou em mim, n√£o pensou na gente
Esperou eu descobrir pra dizer que se arrepende
Combinado, pode deixar que vou sofrer calado

S√≥ vou contar pra duas pessoas
Que ce me traiu, que seu amor √© vagabundo
Pra Deus e o mundo, pra Deus e o mundo
S√≥ Deus e o mundo v√£o saber de tudo

Letra

Fala qual √© a dificuldade de entender 
Que meu n√£o √© um n√£o de verdade
Por favor n√£o se aproveita das minhas horas de car√™ncia 
Desfazer meu nunca mais, √© a sua experi√™ncia 
N√£o me obrigue a voltar na base da insist√™ncia 

Ponto final
√â ponto final 
A n√£o ser que ‚Äúc√™‚Äù venha aqui agora 
Arranque minha roupa coisa e tal
Ponto final
√â ponto final
O problema √© que na sua frente eu solto um ‚ÄúTe amo‚Äù no lugar do tchau

Se N√£o Tivesse Ido - LETRA Compositores: Marco Antonio Solis/Vs. Bruno Vin√≠cius

E eu pensei que nunca ia te perder
Mas tudo que vejo faz lembrar voc√™
Espero o outro dia pra te ver aqui
E um jeito t√£o carente
O sorriso transparente
Se agarrando em mim
A vida vai passando e tudo √© t√£o igual
O pranto no meu rosto √© feito um temporal
√â o vinho que embriaga
P√£o de cada dia
Eu era t√£o feliz e juro, eu n√£o sabia
E nada √© mais dif√≠cil que viver sem ti
Sofrendo pela espera de te ver voltar
O frio do meu corpo pergunta por ti
E n√£o sei onde est√°
Se n√£o tivesse ido eu era t√£o feliz
 
Frio da Madrugada - LETRA 
Compositores: Vinicius X/Gui/Hudson

Sei que voc√™ quer voltar
Quem sou eu pra recusar?
O amor supera tudo
Preciso do teu olhar
N√£o tenha medo da sorte
Ela n√£o vai castigar
Quem ama sempre perdoa
Por isso vou perdoar
O frio da madrugada j√° surrou meu corpo
Nesta cidade quase fiquei louco
Saudade √© fogo
E vai queimando aos poucos, o cora√ß√£o 
Sozinho na madrugada, j√° briguei com a sorte
Falei com meu Deus
Por que n√£o mande a morte?
Sem esse amor
Nada mais importa
A vida perde a raz√£o
 
Mensagem Pra Ela - LETRA
Compositores: C√©sar Menotti/Geraldo Campos

Mandei mensagem pra ela
Ela n√£o me respondeu
Liguei no seu celular
A secret√°ria atendeu
Resolvi abrir meu cora√ß√£o
E falar tudo que eu senti
Na verdade, eu me apaixonei
Na primeira vez que eu te vi
Vou te ligar
Vou deixar recado
Vou mandar mensagem
Pois s√≥ desse jeito
Eu tive coragem
De abrir o jogo nessa liga√ß√£o
Por que me deu a esperan√ßa de ficar com voc√™?
Me deu o seu telefone, se n√£o ia atender?
Por que voc√™ brincou com o meu cora√ß√£o?

ESSE BARULHO
(Murilo Huff / Christian Ribeiro / Junior Pepato / De Angelo)

Em casa n√£o d√°
Eu preciso ouvir uma porta de ferro subindo
E umas cadeira arrastar pra me acalmar
O gar√ßom me servindo e a cerveja caindo no copo
At√© derramar

Isso tem som de felicidade pra mim
√â o som de eu te esquecendo
De pouquim em pouquim

Esse barulho
T√° me ajudando a esquecer voc√™
Esse barulho
Me ajuda a n√£o ouvir
A saudade falar de voc√™

I need to cry 
But I cant get anything out of my eyes
Or my head, did I die?
I need to run
But I can't get out of bed for anyone
Not for you, hun
My sour boy is a pain
I wanna shoot him in the brain
But I‚Äôd miss him in the morning
It really hurts
When I need to so bad but I can‚Äôt see her
My Juliet, my special girl

But I need to understand
When I can power through
And when I need some help from you
When I should stand my ground
And when I need to just sit down
Sometimes I act like I know
But I‚Äôm really just a kid
With two corks in his eyes
And a bully in his head

I wanna make
A colour that no one else has seen before
I wanna be so much more
I hope that she
Looks at me and thinks ‚Äúshit, he‚Äôs so pretty‚Äù
Something I can‚Äôt believe

But I need to understand
When I can power through
And when I need some help from you
When I should stand my ground
And when I need to just sit down
Sometimes I act like I know
But I‚Äôm really just a kid
With two corks in his eyes
And a bully in his head

Lyrics:
I'm a dumb teen boy
I eat sticks and rocks and mud
I don't care about the government
And I really need a hug
I feel stupid (stupid)
Ugly (ugly)
Pretend it doesn't bother me
I'm not very strong but
I'll fuck you up if you're mean to bugs

It's getting cold down here underneath the weather
I skipped class to sit with you
I really like your spotty sweater, if
Ladybugs are girls
How do you make kids together?
What's it like in a female world?
I bet it's just so much better

I just turned fourteen
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean

Don't mess with me, I‚Äôm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how its s‚Äôposed to be? Though it isn‚Äôt me
Boys will be bugs, right?
(Boys will be bugs, right?)

I'm a dumb teen boy
All I wanna do is quit
My mum told me that she's worried
And I couldn't give a shit
I have friends who understand me
Their names are spider, beetle, bee
They don‚Äôt say much but
They have always listened to me

The other boys at school
Think it's cool to hate your parents
But they‚Äôre lying all the time
The bugs advised that I should let 'em
And if you wanna cry
Make sure that they never see it
Or even better yet
Block it out and never feel it

I just turned fourteen
And I think I know everything

Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s‚Äôposed to be? Though it isn‚Äôt me
Boys will be bugs, right?
(Boys will be bugs, right?)

Just turned fourteen
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean
(Just turned fourteen and I think I know everything)
Just turned fourteen
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean
(Just turned fourteen and I think the world revolves around me)

Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s‚Äôposed to be? Though it isn‚Äôt me
Boys will be bugs, right?

Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s‚Äôposed to be? Though it isn‚Äôt me
Boys will be bugs, right?

Lyrics:
Often I am upset that I cannot fall in love but I guess
This avoids the stress of falling out of it
Are you tired of me yet? I'm a little sick right now but I swear
When I'm ready I will fly us out of here

Ooh... I'll cut my hair
Ooh... to make you stare
Ooh... I'll hide my chest
And I'll figure out a way to get us out of here

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Turn off your porcelain face, I can't really think right now in this place
There's too many colours enough to drive all of us insane
Are you dead? sometimes I think I'm dead
Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head
But I don't wanna fall asleep just yet

Ooh... my eyes went dark
Ooh... I don't know where
Ooh... my pupils are
But I'll figure out a way to get us out of here

Get a load of this monster
He doesn't know how to communicate
His mind is in a different place
Will everybody please give him a little bit of space
Get a load of this train-wreck
His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet
But little do we know, the stars
Welcome him with open arms

Ooh... time is
Ooh... slowly
Ooh... tracing his face
But strangely he feels at home in this place

Lyrics:
There once was a bittersweet man and they called him, ""Lemon Boy""
He was growing in my garden and I pulled him out by his hair like a weed
And like weeds do he only came and grew back again
So, I figured this time I might as well let him be

Lemon Boy and me started to get along together
I helped him plant his seeds and we'd mow the lawn in bad weather
It‚Äôs actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
So I got myself a citrus friend

But soon his bittersweet started to rub off on me
You‚Äôd think smelling like lemon zest would be pretty neat
I found out that my friends are more of the savoury type
And they weren‚Äôt too keen on compromising with a nice lemon pie

So Lemon Boy and me, we just gotta get along together
I'll help him plant his seeds and we'll mow the lawn in bad weather
It‚Äôs actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
So, I got myself a citrus friend

But what if I run out of fertilizer
What if the clouds run out of rain
What if Lemon Boy won‚Äôt grow no longer
What if beaches dry of sugarcane
Oh well

The whales start to beach themselves
The tortoise shells tear away from their spines
It happens all the time, it happens all the time

Lemon Boy and I, we‚Äôre gonna live forever
Like Snufkin and Little My, we‚Äôll get around wherever

Lemon Boy and I, we‚Äôre gonna live forever
Like Snufkin and Little My, we‚Äôll get around wherever
It‚Äôs actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him

'Cause we're the bitterest boys in town
Yeah, we‚Äôre the bitterest guys around
And I got myself a citrus friend

Lyrics:
Feeling sick of myself
Think I'll try to be someone else
Can't be hard to paint a person
In my head create a version
A parallel

Pull my head out the sand
Try as hard as I can
Guess I must be satisfactory
You said you love me exactly the way I am
And you know I find it hard to understand
Pay a visit to the doctor 'cause I have

A sweet tooth for you I'm wide awake
The sugar went straight to my brain
Feel like a kid, I double tap
My chest with my fist

I like you
Say it back
Say it back

Never had a cavity
Never had nobody as sweet as you
Smooth around the edges, good as new
Gently insulating every rendez-vous
Caught myself blaming planets, like you do
I know every line and curve of your tattoos

Sweet tooth for you I'm wide awake
The sugar went straight to my brain
Feel like a kid, I double tap
My chest with my fist

I like you
Say it back
Say it back

Sweet tooth for you, my dreamin' space
Is filled with scribbles tore the page
Decipher them with coloured paint
Repair the stitches in my veins

Sweet tooth for you, my honeydew
I'll see you in my garden soon
Beneath the skin it's cardiac
A safety pin, I like you, say it back

Lyrics:
Everybody‚Äôs looking for somebody, for somebody to take home
I‚Äôm not the exception, I‚Äôm a blessing of a body to love on

If you want it bad tonight
Come by me and drop a line
Put your aura into mine
Don‚Äôt be scared if you like it
I could fill you up with life
I could ease your appetite
Know you‚Äôve never been this high
Don‚Äôt be scared if you like it

‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm not here to make friends
No I‚Äôm not here to make friends
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm not here to make friends
I need a lover, I need a lover

I‚Äôm just being honest, baby I just need a partner when the lights come on
Thirty almost got me and I‚Äôm so over love songs, yeah

So if you want it bad tonight
Come by me and drop a line
Know you‚Äôve never been this high
Don‚Äôt be scared if you like it

‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm not here to make friends
No I‚Äôm not here to make friends

‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm not here to make friends
I need a lover, I need a lover

I need a la la la la la la la la la
I need a la la la la la la la la la
I need a la la la la la la la la la
I need a lover, I need a lover

Everybody‚Äôs looking for somebody, for somebody to take home
I‚Äôm not the exception, I‚Äôm a blessing of a body to love on

‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm not here to make friends
No I‚Äôm not here to make friends

‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm not here to make friends

I need a lover, I need a lover
I need a la la la la la la la la la
I need a la la la la la la la la la
I need a la la la la la la la la la

I need a lover, I need a lover
I need a la la la la la la la la la
I need a la la la la la la la la la
I need a la la la la la la la la la
I need a lover, I need a lover

Lyrics:

Are you drunk enough 
Not to judge what I‚Äôm doing 
Are you high enough
To excuse that I‚Äôm ruined
Cause I‚Äôm ruined 
Is it late enough
For you to come and stay over
Cause we‚Äôre free to love
So tease me 

I make no promises
I can‚Äôt do golden rings
But I‚Äôll give you everything
(Tonight)

Magic is in the air
There ain‚Äôt no science here
So come get your everything
(Tonight) 

I make no promises
I can‚Äôt do golden rings
But I‚Äôll give you everything
(Tonight)

Magic is in the air
There ain‚Äôt no science here
So come get your everything
(Tonight) 
Tonight 

Is it loud enough
Cause my body is calling for ya
Calling for ya
I need someone
To do the things that I do
I‚Äôm heating up
Energy‚Äôs taking control
I‚Äôm speeding up
My heartbeat‚Äôs dancing alone

I make no promises
I can‚Äôt do golden rings
But I‚Äôll give you everything
(Tonight)

Magic is in the air
There ain‚Äôt no science here
So come get your everything
(Tonight)

I make no promises
I can‚Äôt do golden rings
But I‚Äôll give you everything
(Tonight)

Magic is in the air
There ain‚Äôt no science here
So come get your everything
(Tonight)
Tonight

Cause I need
Your green light 
Day and night 
Say that you‚Äôre mine

Cause I need
Your green light
Day and night
Say that you‚Äôre mine

I make no promises
I can‚Äôt do golden rings
But I‚Äôll give you everything
(Tonight)

Magic is in the air

Lyrics
Forever feat 6lack

Passwords 
That means you love me 
I can give you what you ask for 
Say you need a shooter 
I can do it from the half court 
I can change your life up
Painting murals on your passport (Louie)
Future kids all on the dashboard 
Ooo
I like every flaw I see in ya
This is all new
But I hope I got what you need too 
(I hope I got what you need)

Cause sometimes somebody loves somebody 
But that body don‚Äôt love ‚Äòem back 
And it‚Äôs easy to say that you didn‚Äôt know
You didn‚Äôt know what you had 
But you don‚Äôt 
You‚Äôre educated 
You know 
That they don‚Äôt make ‚Äòem 
Like me 
Any more
So you pull me in close 
And say 

Stay
Forever 
(I think you should put your bag down you should never leave)
Baby you should stay forever  
(I think you should put your bag down you should never leave)
Baby you should stay 
Forever ah ah ah ah ah ah
Forever ah ah ah ah ah
Forever ah ah ah ah ah ah
Forever ah ah ah ah ah

Passwords passports 
Imma have to treat you like a landlord 
I want you to stay 
Stay the moment 
Got to put it on cam-cord
She a all star porn star 
Throw it up and catch it off the back board
I‚Äôm give you everything that you asked for 
Like you kick down the door on some task force shit 
Credit card numbers four-digit pin social security 
You could be happy you should be happy 
Long as you here with me 
They could never give get between us 
Said we would never ever leave us 
That was a while ago 

Now sometimes somebody loves somebody 
But that body don‚Äôt love ‚Äòem back 
And it‚Äôs easy to say that you didn‚Äôt know
You didn‚Äôt know what you had 
But you don‚Äôt 
You‚Äôre educated 
You know 
That they don‚Äôt make ‚Äòem 
Like me 
Any more
So you pull me in close 
And say 

Stay
Forever 
(I think you should put your bag down you should never leave)
Baby you should stay forever  
(I think you should put your bag down you should never leave)
Baby you should stay 
  
Forever ah ah ah ah ah ah
Forever ah ah ah ah ah
Forever ah ah ah ah ah ah
Forever ah ah ah ah ah

I‚Äôm not perfect, but I‚Äôm worth it
I‚Äôm not perfect, but I‚Äôm working on it
I go up, I go down, I go all the way around
I‚Äôm not perfect, but I‚Äôm worth it

I used to love the nightlife
‚ÄòTill the nightlife got too lonely

Got a feeling that it could be you

I‚Äôm crazy through and through
I wear my flaws like jewellery
And I‚Äôm dripping

I used to love the nightlife
‚ÄòTill the nightlife got too boring
Might be time for the right guy
Got a feeling that it could be you
Could be you, should be you
Two plus two makes one in love
It could be us, baby touch, I‚Äôm soft to touch, yeah

I‚Äôm not perfect, but I‚Äôm worth it
I‚Äôm not perfect, but I‚Äôm working on it
I go up, I go down, I go all the way around
I‚Äôm not perfect, but I‚Äôm worth it

Big lips just how I like
Be brave boy put them on me
I go crazy in the twilight
Got a feeling like you do too
You love that trouble do you
I‚Äôm trouble through and through
I wear my flaws like jewellery
And I‚Äôm dripping

You like them crazy do you
I‚Äôm crazy through and through
I wear my flaws like jewellery
And I‚Äôm dripping

I‚Äôm not perfect, but I‚Äôm worth it
I‚Äôm not perfect, but I‚Äôm working on it
I go up, I go down, I go all the way around
I‚Äôm not perfect, but i‚Äôm worth it

But I‚Äôm worth it
Hey you know I‚Äôm not perfect
Hey you know that I‚Äôm just worth it
Yeah you know
You know I‚Äôm worth it

LYRICS
I do not mind
The rain sometimes
Cuz That‚Äôs the only way the roses
Bloom
In my mind
When I cry
When I cry
That‚Äôs the only way that the roses bloom
 
It‚Äôs ok I‚Äôm not ok 
I feel the disarray of yesterday, oh my
I need to feel the raindrops on my head on my head 
I know I know nothing so (no nothing so)
I embrace what I cannot control, oh my
Trouble walks beside me til my end, til my end 
Oh
 
I do not mind
The rain sometimes
Oh That‚Äôs the only way the roses 
Bloom
In my mind
When I cry
When I cry
That‚Äôs the only way that the roses bloom
 
It‚Äôs better to have loved and Lost
But the feeling it comes at a cost, oh my
My poor heart is my only friend, only friend
And I‚Äôve come to love a heavy sky (a heavy sky)
The lightning couldn‚Äôt beat my shine, oh my 
Trouble walks beside me til my end 
Til my end
Oh
 
I do not mind
The rain sometimes
Oh That‚Äôs the only way the roses
Bloom
In my mind
When I cry
When I cry
That‚Äôs the only way that the roses bloom
 
Hand on my heart
I swear I made peace with the rain (peace with the rain)
Peace with the rain (peace with the rain)
Now I dance with the pain
Yeah
Hand on my heart
I swear I made peace with the rain (peace with the rain)
Peace with the rain (peace with the rain)
Now I slow dance with the pain
But that‚Äôs when roses bloom
 
Roses
Roses 
Roses
 
That‚Äôs when roses bloom
 
Oh
I do not mind
The rain sometimes
Oh That‚Äôs the only way the roses 
Bloom
In my mind
When I cry
When I cry
that‚Äôs the only way

Jessie Reyez - ONLY ONE. An exclusive live performance for Vevo.

Jessie Reyez doesn't mince words. Candor has always been her calling card and ‚ÄòYESSIE,‚Äô her second album in three years, is an extension of that. A master of the well-timed profanity, the R&B pathfinder describes the project as a rumination on the ‚Äúbullsh-t I‚Äôve gone through and the bullsh-t I anticipate going through.‚Äù Some of that past bullsh-t included the bad timing of her debut album release - right at the start of the pandemic. ‚ÄúWe were the guinea pigs,‚Äù she laments. Ebbs, flows, peaks, and valleys of romantic relationships are the foundational landscape of ‚ÄòYESSIE.‚Äô ‚ÄúOnly One‚Äù leans into those selfish feelings of having a crush all to oneself. ‚ÄúDo you want to do this love?/If not, what are we doing?‚Äù As it‚Äôs been said, no one gets to the point quite like Jessie Reyez.

Lyrics

VERSE 1
Sun kissed
My face
Wishing for the real thing
Lonely 
& Outta place
When I don‚Äôt have you with me

Does your heart say the same
On all these nights alone
Or is it 
Just me
Hoping you‚Äôll come home, cause

PRE
I don‚Äôt know if I can make you happy 
No matter what the odds I‚Äôm gonna try
A million miles away I feel you with me
For now our love will live inside my mind, so 

HOOK
Don‚Äôt wake me up
In the middle of the night
Cause I finally found you 

I feel your love 
Everytime I close my eyes
Cause I finally found you

When the times are hardest
I‚Äôll find you in the darkness
You‚Äôre a dream and that is enough

Don‚Äôt wake me up 
In the middle of the night
Cause I finally found you

VERSE 2
Summer days 
So far away
Only see em in the rearview 

How will I hold you again
To make you feel at home

PRE 
Cause, I don‚Äôt know if I can make you happy 
No matter what the odds I‚Äôm gonna try

A million miles away I feel you with me
For now our love will live inside my mind
So

HOOK
Don‚Äôt wake me up
In the middle of the night
Cause I finally found you 

I feel your love 
Everytime I close my eyes
Cause I finally found you

When the times are hardest
I‚Äôll find you in the darkness
You‚Äôre a dream and that is enough

So don‚Äôt wake me up 
In the middle of the night
Cause I finally found you

POST
Ooooo
Ooooo
I finally found you (finally found you)
Ooooo

I finally found you

So don‚Äôt wake me up in the middle of the night

Official Lyrics
Where should we run to
We got the world in our hands and we're ready to play
They say we're wasted 
But how can we waste it if we're loving every day 
Ok
I got the keys to the universe so stay
With me
Cos I got the keys babe

Don't wanna wake up 
One day wishing that we'd done more
I wanna live fast 
Never look back, it's what we're here for
Don't wanna wake up 
One day wondering 
Where'd it all go
Cos we'll be home before we know 
I wanna hear you singing 

Hey Mama don't stress your mind 
We ain't coming home tonight
Hey ma we're gonna be alright 
Dry those eyes
We'll be back in the morning 
When the sun starts to rise 
So Mama don't stress your mind
So Mama don't stress your mind

Mama, Mama, Mama
Yeah
We ain‚Äôt coming home tonight
Mama, Mama, Mama
Yeah
We ain‚Äôt coming home tonight

Where should we run to
We got a ticket that takes us wherever we like 
We got our problems 
But just for the minute let‚Äôs push all our troubles aside
Alright 
Cos we got the keys to universe inside
Our minds 
Ye we got the keys babe

Lyrics 

All the late night conversations
Way too many hesitations
Feel the doubt, I feel the doubt
And the memories I‚Äôve been saving
But the good ones they‚Äôre all fading 
Fading out, they‚Äôre fading out

I hear you calling out my name 
Oh we can‚Äôt go back and that‚Äôs a shame

Wish I could tell you, there‚Äôs no one to blame
Wish I could tell you, I still feel the same
I want you to know now that it was never in vain
And that‚Äôs the last thing that you‚Äôll hear
You‚Äôll hear me say

All the ways I tried to reach you 
Told myself that I still need you how I used to, the way I used to
And I know just what you‚Äôre saying 
but the words don‚Äôt mean the same thing anymore, oh anymore
 
I hear you calling out my name 
Oh we can‚Äôt go back and that‚Äôs a shame

Wish I could tell you, there‚Äôs no one to blame
Wish I could tell you, I still feel the same
I want you to know now that it was never in vain
And that‚Äôs the last thing that you‚Äôll hear
You‚Äôll hear me say

But I wish I could tell you, there‚Äôs no one to blame
Wish I could tell you, I still feel the same
I want you to know now that it was never in vain
that‚Äôs the last thing that you‚Äôll hear
Oh it‚Äôs the last thing that you‚Äôll hear
You‚Äôll hear me say

You‚Äôll hear me say

Eu Gosto Assim ‚Äì participa√ß√£o especial Mari Fernandez
(Junior Pepato / Ben√≠cio Neto / Rafa Borges)

Tem gente que n√£o quer amor
S√≥ gosta do calor, que faz embaixo do len√ßol
Que chega ainda tem lua
Passa a noite toda nua
E vaza no nascer do sol

E olha o que me aconteceu
Achei algu√©m igual eu
A gente se entende assim
Porque nenhum dos dois √© de ‚Äúpra sempre‚Äù

Mas eu gosto assim
Ela n√£o me ama 
Mas eu gosto assim
A gente se pega sem se apegar
A gente usa a cama s√≥ pra se usar
Sem amar

Mas eu gosto assim
Ele n√£o me ama 
Mas eu gosto assim
A gente se pega sem se apegar
A gente usa a cama s√≥ pra se usar
Sem amar
Sem amar
Sem amar

Mari Fernandez

Olha o que me aconteceu
Achei algu√©m igual eu
A gente se entende assim
Porque nenhum dos dois √© de ‚Äúpra sempre‚Äù

Mas eu gosto assim
Ela n√£o me ama mas eu gosto assim
A gente se pega sem se apegar
A gente usa a cama s√≥ pra se usar
Sem amar

Mas eu gosto assim
Ela n√£o me ama mas eu gosto assim 
A gente se pega sem se apegar
A gente usa a cama s√≥ pra se usar
Sem amar
Sem amar
Sem amar

Mas eu gosto assim
A Mari n√£o me ama mas eu gosto assim
A gente se pega sem se apegar
A gente usa a cama s√≥ pra se usar
Sem amar
Mas eu gosto assim

Quando Apaga a Luz - participa√ß√£o especial Don Juan
(Vin√≠cius Poeta, Bruno Sucesso, Vitinho no Beat, Breno Major) 
 
Eu acho lindo o jeito que tu pinta  
a minha fama pras tuas amigas  
Eu acho foda o jeito que tu posta  
fotos de bebida frases de mentira  
 
T√° queimando meu nome na pra√ßa 
mas no meio da madrugada  
C√™ me amassa  
Fala fala mal mas n√£o me larga  
Quem v√™ feed n√£o v√™ pegada  
 
A mesma boca que xinga e que me odeia  
Quando apaga a luz me lambe e me beija  
A mesma boca que mandou eu ir embora  
Quando apaga a luz pede toda hora

[LETRA]
T√¥ aqui pra te contar
Por aqui t√° tudo em paz
Tudo bem...
Eu j√° nem te amo mais

Comecei a me tratar
Se voc√™ quer saber
Te esqueci... 
A uma semana atr√°s

E aquela loucura de mudar pra salvador
Esquece...
Eu nem gosto de calor
Fez uma cozinha maior
Pra juntar a fam√≠lia ao redor
Esquece...
Jantar fora √© bem melhor

Cora√ß√£o receitou, de 8 em 8 horas
Uma dose de Anti-Amor
J√° tomei, funcionou
Eu sou paciente
Cora√ß√£o √© meu doutor

PS: Hoje eu ganhei alta
Nem sinto mais sua falta.

[LETRA]
Me fala qual √© o seu perfume
Que ainda hoje eu vou comprar
T√¥ sentindo minha vida t√£o sem cheiro
E eu j√° sei qual quero dar

N√£o quero ser precipitado
Muito menos te assustar
Mas √© nesse teu sorriso
Que meu beijo quer morar
E nas curvas do seu corpo
Invadir a contram√£o
Dar de frente com seu peito
S.o.s cora√ß√£o 

Conheci o amor
S√≥ de te olhar
Tava quase congelando 
Voc√™ veio pra esquentar 
Conheci o amor 
E ele me fez ver 
Que eu voei tempo demais 
Deixa eu pousar em voc√™

Sofrimento Antecipado
(Matheus Marcolino / Daniel Caon / Thiago Teg / Graciano Teg / Gabriel Pascoal)

Fica assim ent√£o
a partir desse tchau, foi mal
Vou cortar rela√ß√£o
√â que eu n√£o aguento n√£o
saber que eu n√£o vou ser mais o motivo desse sorris√£o

N√£o quero contato n√£o quero not√≠cia 
Parei de seguir pra seguir minha vida 
Mas em qualquer coisa que te envolve 
toca na ferida 

(refr√£o)
J√° t√¥ me vendo b√™bado te stalkeando pelo perfil falso
Te imaginando b√™bada tirando a roupa pra outro no quarto
Nem sei se j√° saiu se beijou se entregou 
E eu j√° t√¥ um baga√ßo
√â que eu sou emocionado
e sofro tudo antecipado

Gustavo Mioto - DESPEDIDA DE CASAL - DVD Ao Vivo Em Fortaleza
Compositores: Gabriel do Cavaco / J√∫nior Gomes / Benicio / Flavinho do Kadet

Mesa pra dois num restaurante chique
Vinho chileno, na entrada um ceviche
Toda cheirosa, fez at√© penteado
Batom vermelho e vestido colado

Ela passou a noite sorrindo
Falou que eu tava lindo
Queria que a noite fosse inesquec√≠vel e foi...

Foi nosso jantar √† luz de adeus
Nossa despedida de casal
Ela terminou sem derramar nenhuma l√°grima
E eu ainda n√£o digeri esse final

Foi nosso jantar √† luz de adeus
Nossa despedida de casal
Ela terminou sem derramar nenhuma l√°grima
E eu ainda n√£o digeri esse final
T√° engasgado aqui aquele tchau

Gustavo Mioto - SOLTEIRO N√ÉO TRAI - DVD Ao Vivo Em Fortaleza
Compositores: Jujuba, Hiago Nobre, Robson Lima, Kinho Chef√£o, Jo√£o Lima

J√° √© a quinta vez 
Que voc√™ liga assim do nada 
Que dorme em cama separada
A quinta vez que voc√™ terminou 
Mas √© a primeira vez
Que eu conhe√ßo outra pessoa
Que eu to beijando outra boca
Depois que eu conheci voc√™ 

Ent√£o diz porque 
T√° me ligando com essa voz de raiva 
Se entre n√≥s n√£o existe mais nada 
Foi esse fim que voc√™ escolheu 

Para de dizer que eu te tra√≠
Meu cora√ß√£o n√£o te pertence mais
Solteiro n√£o trai

Restri√ß√£o Sentimental
Gustavo Mioto / Day / Lara

Recomendam cortar o que te faz mal 
feito quem tem press√£o alta 
e tem que evitar o sal
Me disseram que eu tenho paix√µes excessivas 
chocolate √°lcool e cafe√≠na 
e o maior delas n√£o t√° nessa lista 

Voc√™ √© o v√≠cio mais dif√≠cil de perder 

S√≥ n√£o chega perto que eu aceito
eu t√¥ de regime do seu beijo 
Gostar de voc√™ s√≥ me faz mal 
A partir de agora √© restri√ß√£o sentimental

Pro Nosso Bem [ Letra ]
Compositores: Vinicius Poeta, Daniel Caon, Elan Rubio, Bruno Sucesso

Tira uma d√∫vida aqui
O tempo que passou longe de mim 
Fez bem ou n√£o te fez t√£o bem assim
O que eu sei √© que t√° bad por aqui

Ser√° que j√° se acostumou
A dormir com os dois travesseiros
N√£o disputar espa√ßo no chuveiro 
E acordar sem o meu beijo chato de despertador 
Ser√° que j√° se acostumou

Como √© que t√° seu cora√ß√£o 
Sozinho sem mim 
E se tiver igual ao meu 
Que d√≥, tadinho
Pro nosso bem escuta a dica 
Pega sua vida e traz de volta pra minha

E esse √© o curioso caso de solteiro que entrou quarto
Saiu suado, emocionado,
catando a roupa e a chave do carro  
Mas esqueceu o cora√ß√£o 
Em cima daquela cama
Eu fui dar uma de bonz√£o 
E adivinha quem falou que ama?!

Eu t√¥ envolvid√£o 
Olha o rei dos perdido
Mandando um ‚Äúsaudade‚Äù e localiza√ß√£o 
Eu t√¥ envolvid√£o 
Logo eu que pensava s√≥ em sacanagem
Envolvi o cora√ß√£o 

Eu n√£o queria mas fiquei

Lyrics:
sun in my eyes
navy blue skies
you are the reason
i can survive
we‚Äôll turn off the phones
to just be alone
we‚Äôll draw the curtains
and never leave home

i had a nightmare
but now that i‚Äôm not scared
this is how you fall in love
let go and i‚Äôll hold you up
so pull me tight and close your eyes
oh my love,
side to side
what‚Äôs easy is right
my mother‚Äôs advice
you are the reason
i never think twice
 
wherever we go
what glitters is gold
you‚Äôll be my best friend
until we grow old
i had a nightmare
but now that i‚Äôm not scared
this is how you fall in love
let go and i‚Äôll hold you up
so pull me tight and close your eyes
oh my love,
side to side

‚ñ∫""""always, i'll care"""" Lyrics:

always, i‚Äôll care
driving down the interstate
i‚Äôve never felt so far away
leaving hardly hurts at all
i‚Äôm sorry that I never call
 
often i get exhausted
trying regardless to be enough
is it selfish, not to be selfless
when all i can help is to open up
 
i‚Äôll be better then i was before
despite every text of yours ignored
will you call me still just to hear my voice
i swear
always, i‚Äôll care
 
flipping through our photographs
these moments never seem to last
listening to self control
there‚Äôs feelings that you‚Äôll never know
 
leave me, it‚Äôs never easy
i‚Äôve had a lifetime to be alone
if you let me, when it gets heavy
no i‚Äôll never let you be all alone
 
i‚Äôll be better then i was before
despite every text of yours ignored
will you call me still just to hear my voice
i swear
always, 
always,
always, i‚Äôll care
