Letra
Autor: Samuel Rosa

Escorre o tempo que seguro e cabe em minhas mãos
Eu empresto o meu mundo pra te ter então
Você vai acreditar talvez
Ou senão queira partir de vez

E se eu falasse nessas coisas que vejo em você
Me atravessam num segundo sem eu entender
E tudo que me faz ver 
E tudo que me faz ter

Aquilo que eu sinto por você
Parece ser maior
Que o destino que me passa e te passa 
E há de ser um só

A gente é diferente quando sente 
Mas pode ser que mesmo assim
A gente até se ajeite

Você bem que podia vir comigo 
Para além do final dessa rua 
O outro lado da cidade
Ou algo parecido

Estou livre com seu passo e aperto sua mão
Que me mostra o caminho pra te ter então
Com você quero partir de vez 
Sem destino e sem lugar talvez

Despreocupo com futuro que ninguém prevê
O que entristece tento esquecer
Isso tanto faz
Isso já não faz mal

Aquilo que eu sinto por você
Parece ser maior
Que o destino que me passa e te passa 
E há de ser um só

A gente é diferente quando sente 
Mas pode ser que mesmo assim
A gente até se ajeite

Você bem que podia vir comigo 
Para além do final dessa rua 
O outro lado da cidade
Ou algo parecido

Você bem que podia vir comigo 
Para além do final dessa rua 
O outro lado da cidade
A gente é parecido

Letras:

Hoje acordei sem lembrar
Se vivi ou se sonhei
Você aqui nesse lugar
Que eu ainda não deixei

Vou ficar?
Quanto tempo
Vou esperar
E eu não sei o que vou fazer, não

Nem precisei revelar
Sua foto não tirei
Como tirei pra dançar
Alguém que avistei

Tempo atrás
Esse tempo está lá trás
E eu não tenho mais o que fazer, não

E eu ainda gosto dela
Mas ela já não gosta tanto assim
A porta ainda está aberta
Mas da janela já não entra luz

E eu ainda penso nela
Mas ela já não pensa mais em mim
Em mim não

Ainda vejo o luar
Refletido na areia
Aqui na frente desse mar
Sua boca eu beijei

Lyrics:

I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive

I'll fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again...

Lyrics:
Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas
With Waylon and Willie and the boys
This successful life we're livin'
Got us feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys
Between Hank Williams' pain songs and
Newbury's train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain
Out in Luckenbach, Texas ain't nobody feelin' no pain

 The good life he promised ain't what she's livin' today

 Or the bad things he's done, lord
 She just talks about the good times they've had
 And all the good times to come

 She loves him in spite of his ways she don't understand

Lyrics:
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleighbells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

All I want for Christmas is you
You're the gift that made my dreams all come true
All I need for Christmas is here
Finding every sweet surprise wrapped up in your eyes
Waiting there for me underneath a tree
We'll spend the day exchanging kisses
Smile and say, ""What a Christmas this is!""
Long before the snowflakes appear
Without bells or mistletoe or the tinsel's silver glow
You just look at me and, oh, Christmas is here

It was released in 1974. 

It's intro is a nod to 'Song For My Father' by Horace Silver.  Donald Fagen said in a 2011 interview when asked about the intro 'There was never a conscious thought about picking up Horace Silver's intro. We wrote this Brazilian bass line and when drummer Jim Gordon heard it, he played his figures. As for the piano line, I think I had heard it on an old Sergio Mendes album. Maybe that where Horace heard it, too [laughs]'.

Several musicians outside the band help out on the track. Michael Omartian plays keyboard, Dean Parks acoustic guitar, Jim Gordon drums, Victor Feldman percussion, and Timothy Schmit along with Fagen on backing vocals.  I have done a slideshow video featuring most of these guest musos, as well as the usual Dan suspects, Donald Fagen (vocals), Walter Becker (bass) and Jeff  Baxter (guitar, solo) .Denny Dias was not on the track.

This list of musos for this track is taken from the liner notes on 'A Decade of Steely Dan' compilation CD and a book I have on Steely Dan entitled 'Reelin in the Years' by Brian Sweet.  According to Sweet, Jeff Baxter played the solo without an amplifier, just plugged directly into the board.  Apparently the solo had to be done several times because of a 'blip' appearing on the tape.  After sending the tape to the manufacturer 3M for analysis, it was found to have some little lumps which turned out to be mustard from a workman's sandwich!  

Sweet also stated that the song was based on a student named Rikki from Bard College who had made an impression on Becker and Fagen, (although they were not known for giving straight answers when explaining their songs, so who knows?). 

I tried to include images of Steely Dan and Donald Fagen album covers. I also obtained an add on to Windows Movie Maker, which gives a few more panning and zoom options. This is the first video using those.  

(Update: as of 11 June 2012, this video is the most popular of the 90 music videos I have up on my channel with  502,904 hits). Further update as of 4 Sept 2017, it now has 4.180,112 hits.  Also sadly, I have just found out that co founder and composer Walter Becker has just passed.  RIP.

Lyrics - 


[Intro: Timbaland]
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me?
East Coast, feel me, West Coast, feel me
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me?
East Coast, feel me, West Coast, feel me
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me?
East Coast, feel me, West Coast, feel me
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me?
East Coast, feel me, West Coast, feel me

[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
Boy, I've been watching you like the hawk in the sky
That flies, but you were my prey (My prey)
Boy, I promise you if we keep bumpin' heads
I know that one of these days (Days)
We gon' hook it up, prolly talk on the phone
But see, I don't know if that's good
I've been holdin' back this secret from you
I probably shouldn't tell it

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
But if I, If I let you know
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' 'bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no, 'cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?
[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
Boy, won't you pick me up at the park right now
Up the block, while everyone sleep, sleep, sleep
I'll be waiting there with my trench, my locs, my hat
Just so I'm lowkey, If you tell the world
(Don't speak, you know that would be weak)
Oh boy, see I'm trusting you with my heart, my soul
I probably shouldn't let you

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
But if I, If I let this go
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' 'bout nobody
I hope you're responsible
Boy, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no, 'cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody

[Verse 3: Timbaland & Aaliyah]
Baby girl, I'm the man from the big VA
Won't you come play round my way
And listen to what I gotta say
Timbaland (What) don't you know I am the man
Rock shows here to Japan
Have people shaking, shaking my hand
Baby girl, better known as Aaliyah
Give me goosebumps and high fevers
Makin' playa haters believers
Don'tcha know, gotta tell somebody, cause
'Cause I really need somebody (What?)
Tell me you're that somebody (What?)
[Chorus: Aaliyah]
If I let this go
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' 'bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no, 'cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' 'bout nobody
I hope you're responsible
Boy, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no, 'cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm bout naughty naughty
'Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?

Love it babe, love it babe, love it babe
Love it babe, love it babe, love it babe
Love it babe, love it babe, love it babe
Love it babe, love it babe, love it babe
 
[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
Baby, you don't know what you do to me
Between me and you I feel a chemistry
I won't let no one come and take your place
'Cause the love you give, it can't be replaced
See, no one else love me like you do
That's why I don't mind to spend my life with you
I wanna please you in anyway I can
I wanna share my world, don't you understand?
 
[Hook: Aaliyah]
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin', all day long
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin', all day long
 
[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
Turn me inside out, make my heart speak
Need no one else, you're all I need
Personality and everything you do
Makes me love everything about you
Your smile, your style
Is so fly, I can't deny
I got a crush on you, and that is true indeed

I'm diggin' you, you make me believe


[Hook: Aaliyah]
That your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin', all day long
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin', all day long
 
[Bridge: Aaliyah]
I'll give you anything you want from me
Anything you want, anything you need
Anything your soul desires
I'll give you anything you want from me
Anything you want anything you need
Anything your soul desires
Anything 'cause
 
[Hook: Aaliyah]
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin', all day long
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin', all day long
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin', all day long
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on

Lyrics - 



[Intro: Timbaland]
It's been a long time (Long time)
We shouldn't have left you (Left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to (Step)
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky
It's been a long time (Time)
We shouldn't have left you (Left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to (Step)
Step to, freaky-freaky-freaky
Baby girl, uh

[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
What would you do to get to me?
What would you say to have your way?
Would you give up or try again?
If I hesitate to let you in
Now would you be yourself or play a role?
Tell all the boys or keep it low?
If I say no, would you turn away?
Or play me off or would you stay?
Oh

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
And if at first you don't succeed (Oh)
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
Again, again
[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
I'm into you, you into me
But I can't let it go so easily
Not 'til I see what this could be
Could be eternity or just a week
But, yo, our chemistry is off the chain
It's perfect now, but will it change?
This ain't a yes, this ain't a no
Just do your thing
We'll see how we go

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
And if at first you don't succeed (Oh, yeah)
Then dust yourself off and try again (Again)
You can dust it off and try again, try again (Yeah)
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (Ooh)
You can dust it off and try again (Try again)
Dust yourself off and try again (Yeah), try again
Again, again

[Verse 3: Aaliyah]
So, you don't wanna throw it all away
I might be shy on the first date
What about the next date?
Huh (Huh), huh (Huh)
Huh (Huh), huh (Oh)
I said, you don't wanna throw it all away (Away)
I might be buggin' on the first date
What about the next date? (Date)
Huh (Huh), huh (Huh)
Huh (Huh), huh (Oh)
[Chorus: Aaliyah]
And if at first you don't succeed
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
Again, again

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
And if at first you don't succeed (Uh, yeah)
Then dust yourself off (Uh) and try again (You can)
You can dust it off and try again, try again (Again)
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (Ooh)
You can dust it off and try again (Again)
Dust yourself off and try again (Yeah), try again
Again, again

[Chorus]
And if at first you don't succeed (No)
Then dust yourself off and try again (Yeah)
You can dust it off and try again, try again (Yeah)
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (Baby)
You can dust it off (Hey) and try again (Yeah)
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
Again, again
[Interlude: Timbaland]
It's been a long time (Time)
We shouldn't have left you (Left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to (Step)
Step to, step to, step to (Freaky)
It's been a long time (Time)
We shouldn't have left you (Left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to
Step to, step to, step to (Freaky-freaky)

[Chorus: Aaliyah & Timbaland]
And if at first you don't succeed
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
Again, again

[Outro: Timbaland]
It's been a long time (Time)
We shouldn't have left you (Left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to, what?
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky (Whoa)
It's been a long time (Time)
We shouldn't have left you (Left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to, what?
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky (We out)
One mo' again
The new millennium, baby
And we out, you guess who it is

Lyrics - 

[Verse 1]
If your girl only knew
That you was trying to get with me (what would she do)
If your girl only knew
That you was dissin' her to talk to me
 
[Chorus]
She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry
 
[Verse 2]
If your girl only knew
That I would want to kick it with you (If she knew)
And if your girl could only see
How you be calling me, getting fresh with me (She would leave!)
 
[Chorus]
She would probably leave you alone (Leaave. You alone)
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry
 
[Bridge]
She's crazy to put up with you
Oh boy I won't be no fool
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me
But it's dumb to put up with you
I won't be no fool
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me

erified


[Chorus]
She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry
 
She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry
 
(If your girl only knew) She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
(If your girl only knew) I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry
 
[Outro: Timbaland & Aaliyah]
If your girl only knew

Lyrics - 

[Verse 1]
Passion, instant, sweat beads, feel me
Cupid's shot me, my heartbeat's racing
Tempt me (Tempt me), try me (Try me), feels so exciting
Thought of highly, it's yours entirely
 
[Hook]
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than your other
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than enough for you
I'll be, I'll, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, even more under covers
I'll be more, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than enough for you
 
[Verse 2]
Midnight grindin', heart rate's climbin'
You go (You go), I go, 'cause we share (We share) pillows (Pillows)
Chase me, leave me, there's still no separating
Morning massages with new bones in your closet
 
[Hook]
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than your other
I said I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than enough for you
I'll be more, I'll, I'll be more than a lover (More)
More than a woman, even more under covers
I'm gonna be more, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than enough for you
[Bridge]
I don't think you're ready
(I don't think you're ready for this thing)
For this thing
(I don't think you're ready for this thing)
You're not ready, no, no
(I don't think you're ready for this thing)
This thing, this thing
(I don't think you're ready for this thing)
 
[Verse 3]
Constant pleasures, no scale can measure
Secrets, treasures, keeps on getting better (Yeah)
Do you wanna roll with me?
We can go to foreign lands with your hand in my hand
Do you wanna ride with me?
We can be like Bonnie & Clyde, be by your side
 
[Hook]
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than your other
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than enough for you
I'll, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, even more under covers
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than enough for you

Lyrics - 


[Intro]
Oh, hey
Yeah-yeah-yeah
No-no-no-no-no-no

[Hook]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I've been needing you (Said I'm needing you)
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you

[Verse 1]
Off to college, yes, you went away
Straight from high school, you up and left me
We were close friends, also lovers
Did everything for one another
Now you're gone and I'm lost without you here now
But I know I gotta live and make it somehow
Come back to me, can you feel me calling?
Hear me calling for you, for you, 'cause it's

[Hook]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I've been needing you, wanting you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes (I miss you)

[Verse 2]
Now I'm sitting here, thinking 'bout you
And the days we used to share
It's driving me crazy, I don't know what to do
I'm just wondering if you still care
I don't wanna let you know that it's killing me
I know you got another life you gotta concentrate, baby
Come back to me, can you feel me calling?
Hear me calling for you, for you, 'cause it's

[Hook]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I been needing you, wanting you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
I've been needing you, wanting you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes, yeah
I miss you

[Bridge]
I-I-I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I-I-I (I miss you)
I-I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I-I
I can't be no more, no
Since you went away, I don't really feel like talking (No)
No one here to love me (No), baby, do you understand me?
I can't do a thing without you

[Hook]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
Tell what I'm gonna do?
Said I've been needing you (Yeah), wanting you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes (Yeah)
I miss you (Baby)
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I've been needing you, wanting you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I've been needing you, wanting you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes

你破舊的玩偶 你的 面具 你的自我

他們說 要縫好你的傷 沒有人愛小丑
為何孤獨 不可 光榮
人只有不完美 值得歌頌
誰說污泥滿身的不算英雄
 
愛你孤身走暗巷
愛你不跪的模樣
愛你對峙過絕望
不肯哭一場
 
愛你破爛的衣裳
卻敢堵命運的槍
愛你和我那麼像

在廢墟之上

十年

曲：陳小霞
詞：林夕
編：陳輝陽

如果那兩個字沒有顫抖　我不會發現　我難受
怎麼說出口　也不過是分手
如果對於明天沒有要求　牽牽手就像旅遊
成千上萬個門口　總有一個人要先走

＊懷抱既然不能逗留　何不在離開的時候　一邊享受　一邊淚流

＃十年之前　我不認識你　你不屬於我　我們還是一樣
　陪在一個陌生人左右　走過漸漸熟悉的街頭

　十年之後　我們是朋友　還可以問候　只是那種溫柔
　再也找不到擁抱的理由　情人最後難免淪為朋友＊

Repeat ＊,＃

直到和你做了多年朋友　才明白我的眼淚
不是為你而流　也為別人而流",True,True,40693771.0,cantopop

若　如若時晨未到
似水點散下落花　變朝露

若　如若時來運到
水點經過瀑布　萬人讚好

缺一門　你尚有星門
能不管　離合注定　你定悲歡

忘記它　仿似遺忘密碼
無密碼　方可以忘記它
隨鏡花　一切如盲婚啞嫁
由它去轉化

別　別去懷恨月老
至少得到彈指間　那花渡

苦　苦水隨甜蜜續吐
暗黑先會頓覺　夕陽那麼好

五七言　也是太多言
能膚淺　忘掉對白　李白也是曲線　(亦靠天)

忘記它　仿似遺忘密碼
無密碼　方可以忘記它
隨鏡花　一切如盲婚啞嫁　作得準嗎 
無謂徵婚轉嫁　無謂招婚改嫁

忘記它　拋棄遺傳密碼　(為何還用解碼)
無密碼　根生已忘記花　(蟬在笑　夏季沒雪花)
忘記花　花瓣隨盲婚啞嫁　(萬世不朽終需腐化)
人非花　飛花與芽冬與夏
(人非花　秋冬變夏　暴雨下不想也罷)
凡間的戲碼

單車
 
曲：柳重言
詞：黃偉文
編：柳重言

不要不要假設我知道
一切一切也都是為我而做
為何這麼偉大　如此感覺不到
不說一句的愛有多好
只有一次記得實在接觸到
騎著單車的我倆　懷緊貼背的擁抱

難離難捨想抱緊些　茫茫人生好像荒野
如孩兒能伏於爸爸的肩膊　誰要下車
難離難捨總有一些　常情如此不可堆卸
任世間再冷酷　想起這單車還有幸福可借

經已給我怎會看不到
雖說演你角色實在有難度
從來虛位以待　何不給個擁抱

想我怎去相信這一套
多疼惜我卻不便讓我知道
懷念單車給你我　唯一有過的擁抱

難離難捨想抱緊些　茫茫人生好像荒野
如孩兒能伏於爸爸的肩膊
哪怕遙遙長路多斜
你愛我愛多些　讓我他朝走得堅壯些
你介意來愛護　又靠誰施捨

難離難捨想抱緊些　茫茫人生好像荒野
如孩兒能伏於爸爸的肩膊　誰要下車
難離難捨總有一些　常情如此不可堆卸
任世間怨我壞　可知我只得你

天后與K歌之王的首次合作， 是一種不事聲張的淺吟低唱。 此類溫暖上口的小調對於詞曲作者小柯自然是輕車熟路， 他不負眾望，一氣呵成完成了這首＜因為愛情＞。  陳奕迅的溫柔中音， 感情豐沛自不在話下。 而王菲的唱法則是歌曲愈平實，聲音愈見變化。  陳奕迅的敦厚感性，王菲的細膩空靈， 兩相對照，綿裡藏針，相得益彰。

About Bad Boy Entertainment:

In 1993, Sean “Puff Daddy” Combs, also known as Diddy, launched Bad Boy Records. Nobody could have
imagined the impact the label would have on pop culture. As a subsidiary of the larger Bad Boy
Entertainment, the label became best known for its signature sound of streetwise hip-hop soul and the
ghetto fabulousness that radiated like precious jewels from its very name. Bad Boy was designed for
those who aspired higher, but also wanted to party until the break of dawn. Puffy had seen life from
both sides of the class divide and, with his groove-heavy music, worked hard to merge the two. There is

And when we kiss it's the perfect weekend, no rain in sight 
And when I'm feelin' incomplete, you're my missing piece
And when you need your breath taken away I'll be your thief 

From the start to the end we don't need to pretend that we're perfect all the time 
'Cause we know what we have through the good and the bad 
It's the strength that you can't deny 
I don't need to find a million reasons why 
This is us, this is us and this is how we love 
Some ways we're different but together we're so right 
This is us, this is us and this is how we love, oh yeah 


And even if we fall apart we'll never feel alone 
Just like the moon starts risin' our hearts bring us home 
We can always find each other like the northern star 
Doesn't matter where we are our love can't go that far 

From the start to the end we don't need to pretend that we're perfect all the time 
'Cause we know what we have, through the good and the bad 
It's the strength that you can't deny 

I don't need to find a million reasons why 
This is us, this is us and this is how we love 
Some ways we're different but together we're so right 
This is us, this is us and that's the way we love 


We don't always see eye to eye You might see a million colors, 
I just see it black and white Ain't no way we could get much higher 
'Cause when we touch it feels like fire We both know how good this feels 
Yes, we do baby because This is you, this is me, this is us 

I don't need to find a million reasons why 
This is us, this is us and this is how we love 
Some ways we're different but together we're so right 
This is us, this is us and this is how we love

Lyrics:
[female voice sampled]
Standing at the bus stop
I heard a voice behind me saying... ""Hi, baby""
Ohh I just fell all apart inside
Because I hadn't heard that voice in such a LONG time
I turned around...

[Ghost talking over sample]
That's right y'all, y'all shoulda seen what I did
So so pretty, so pretty - y'all hear how she sounds right?
She sounds crazy right? Yes
This what happened at the bus stop

[Ghostface Killah]
She turned around and this grown lady said hi
I was quite stunned from the way she replied
Peace, nice to meet ya, sweetie call me Tony Starks
Ghost if you like ta, mind if invite ya
over for some red wine, nice Barry White huh
She pulled out a cigarette, hon here's a lighter
Her voice was a slow jam, full length white mink
Hella fine with a beauty mark on her right cheek
When she spoke her smoke floated when it left her throat
Spelled honey when she blew it out it turned to water word
I was infatuated
She put the perfume to her neck and sprayed it
Plus the bottle was nickel plated
It make a young girl steez yo feel outdated
And know the married chicks shopping with they man's hated
One stone on her finger was green, Maybeline
Cover Girl lipstick, plump color fingertips
Revlon face blush, oh-five-six shit
The ashes was hangin off her stog' so she flicked it
Damn, had to bundle up, I call goosebumps
Plus the windchill factor had dropped, here the bus come
I never rush one, here take my number miss
I live alone, her face fell when I dropped the chrome
Damn, can I have YOUR number? [bus pulls away]",False,False,468161.0,hip hop music

Lyrics:
My God, so they are killers
I've heard lots of people say once a man's a killer, they just keep on killing and killing
They sort of develop a taste for blood
Yeah, that's right
They kill one man, or kill ten
It's all the same (Yes)
After all, they can only hang you once

Both hands clusty, chillin' with my man Rusty
Low down, blew off the burner, kinda dusty
The world can't touch Ghost, purple tape, Rae co-host
Monty Hall expo, intellect, you read pro
Son's triflin' fuck, wildflower on the cycle and
Picked up the broom thought I was Michael-in'
West Brighton Pool, now I'm into Iron Duels
Turn nuns to Earths, Whoopi, she at Allah school
Inhale break beats of Hell a-alikes propel parallel
Duracell knot, you flashed a burnt cell
Snap out of Candyland, kids, the old rumor is
Blacks become immune and shit, we never did
Like eating dead birds, trust the pharmacy over herbs
Men marrying men, ill they got the urge, pulsar
Scissor hand wig vanished in the winter, living off land
You god damn right I fuck fans, king me
Check, checkmate, props like the micro chip founder
Neck to neck stock with Bill Gates now

When we hug these mics we get busy (Busy)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (G-O-D)
Make you snap your fingers or wiggle (Wiggle)
Scream, shout, laugh or just giggle (Giggle)
Shake that body, party that body
Don't fuck with Ghost, you'll feel sorry
That's word, I'm not the herb
Understand what I'm saying, saying, saying?

Hit mics like Ted Koppel, rifle expert
Let off the Eiffel, burn a flag in your grass, spiteful
Ringleader set it off, rap Derek Jeter
Culprit, prince of the game, wish you could see us
We lay low, glitter wax full bangles
Priceless ropes, lay around the God, get tangled
Woolly hair, eyes fiery red, feet made of brass
Twelve men following me, it be the God staff
Move, every script's like Miramax
Smashed the big boy, totaled it, Wilshire and Fairfax
Sun beamin', wifey on the beach sipping Zima
Wu 'binos to Latinos, we love Selena
Overnight, God schedules, FedEx
Pretty silhouette, velvet nice, DNA scroll genetics
Too hot to handle, one thought from scrambling the mandolin
Hundred game Wilt Chamberlain, smack 'em, say when
He rollin' up, face wrinkled up, hands is on his nuts
Yo kid, stop fronting on the grounds 'fore you get touched
It's Canada Dry sess with Allah, son
We want rye, we want it so bad we might cry

For every blow, depends on breath control
So it's the first thing you must learn
Fortunately it's easy
You'll soon learn
My God, so they are killers
Killing and killing
They sort of develop a taste for blood
My God, so they are killers
My God— My God, so they are killers

Lyrics:
We eat fish, toss salads and make rap ballads
The biochemical slanglord'll throw the arrows
In the dope fiend, vocal cords switch laser beams
My triple sevens broke the slot machines out in Queens
Grey Poupon is Revlon rap, smack pawns, swing like batons
Most my niggas smoke like Hillshire Farms
Check the gummy sole, underneath my shoe lies the tap
That attract bow-legged bitches with wide horse gaps
In steel mills I inhale smoke to blow on duns
You run errands, Primatene Mist is afraid of my lungs
Turn my channel, it'll blow your whole bench off the panel
Like eighty roman candles that backfired then slammed you
Every day is like a video shoot, check this shit
I take it back to Playboy, stash guns in whips
Picture afro picks, shish kabobs and dashikis
Thousands civil marched, raised their fists in early sixties

LETRA
É mais uma dia sem você
Mais uma noite que eu espero
Se alguém no mundo quis você, fui eu

Te dei os sonhos que eu sonhei
Te imaginei pra vida inteira
Se alguém fez tudo por você
Fui eu

Diz agora o que é que eu faço pra viver
Se a cada dia é mais difícil te esquecer
Tudo isso faz doer demais
Eu queria só voltar atrás
Ficar contigo

Diz agora o que é que eu faço pra aceitar
Será que existe outra pessoa em meu lugar?
Mas o tempo vai te convencer
E um dia vai reconhecer
Que sem mim não pode mais viver

Sentimento dói por dentro
E a solidão não quer parar de machucar
Sentimento dói por dentro
Meu coração não quer ninguém no seu lugar

E um dia vai reconhecer
Que sem mim não pode mais viver

Sentimento dói por dentro
E a solidão não quer parar de machucar
Sentimento dói por dentro
Meu coração não quer ninguém no seu lugar
