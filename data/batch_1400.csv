LYRIC:
MUJERES DIVINAS
Hablando de mujeres y traiciones
Se fueron consumiendo las botellas
Pidieron que cantara mis canciones
Y yo canté unas dos en contra de ellas
De pronto que se acerca un caballero
Su pelo ya pintaba algunas canas
Me dijo le suplico compañero
Que no hable en mi presencia de las damas
Le dije que nosotros simplemente
Hablamos de lo mal que nos pagaron
Que si alguien opinaba diferente
Sería porque jamás lo traicionaron
Que si alguien opinaba diferente
Sería porque jamás lo traicionaron

Me dijo yo soy uno de los seres
Que más ha soportado los fracasos
Y siempre me dejaron las mujeres
Llorando y con el alma hecha pedazos
Más nunca les reprocho mis heridas
Se tiene que sufrir cuando se ama
Las horas más hermosas de mi vida
Las he pasado al lado de una dama
Pudiéramos morir en las cantinas
Y nunca lograríamos olvidarlas
Mujeres o mujeres tan divinas
No queda otro camino que adorarlas
Mujeres o mujeres tan divinas
No queda otro camino que adorarlas",True,True,103018895.0,Not Found

Song Lyrics English:
====
Pahala pahala pyaar hai, pahali pahali baar hai
Jaanake bhi anajaana, kaisa mera yaar hai

Usaki najar, palakon ki chilaman se mujhe dekhati
Usaki haya, apani chaahat ka raaj kholati
Chhup ke kare jo wafa, aisa mera yaar hai

Wo hai nisha, wo hi mere zindagi ki bhor hai
Use hai pata, usake hi haathon men meri dor hai
Saare jahaan se juda, aisa mera yaar hai

Song Lyrics Hindi:
====
पहला पहला प्यार है
पहली पहली बार है
जान के भी अन्जाना
कैसा मेरा यार है

उसकी नज़र, पलकों की चिलमन से मुझे देखती
उसकी हया, अपनी ही चाहत का राज़ खोलती
छुप के करे जो वफ़ा, ऐसा मेरा यार है
पहला पहला प्यार है...

वो है निशा, वो ही मेरी ज़िंदगी की भोर है
उसे है पता, उसके ही हाथों में मेरी डोर है
सारे जहां से जुदा, ऐसा मेरा प्यार है
पहला पहला प्यार है...",True,True,3591746.0,filmi music

Song Lyrics Hindi:
====

तुमसे मिलने की तमन्ना है
प्यार का इरादा है
और एक वादा हैं जानम
जो कभी हम मिले
तो ज़माना देखेगा अपना प्यार
ओ मेरे यार

मैं शायर नहीं, दीवाना नहीं
मैं आशिक़ नहीं परवाना नहीं
मिली जबसे नज़र, तब से जान-ए-जिगर
मैं हो गया दीवाना
अब जाने क्या होगा जान-ए-जाना
तुमसे मिलने की तमन्ना...

क्या पता फिर कहाँ कब मुलाकात हो
वो हसीना से फिर दिल की बात हो
उसके जैसी हंसीं मैंने देखी नहीं
रोकेगा क्या ज़माना मैंने दिल में है ठाना
मुझको उसे है अभी अपना बनाना
तुमसे मिलने की तमन्ना...

Song Lyrics English:
====

Tumse milne ki tamanna hai
Pyar ka irada hai
Aur ek vaada hain jaanam x (2)

Jo kabhi hum mile
To zamana dekhega apna pyar
Ho mere yaar, ho mere yaar

Tumse milne ki tamanna hai
Pyar ka irada hai
Aur ek vaada hain jaanam
Jo kabhi hum mile
To zamana dekhega apna pyar
Ho mere yaar, ho mere yaar

Tumse milne ki tamanna hai
Pyar ka irada hai
Aur ek vaada hain jaanam

Main shayar nahi, deewana nahi
Main aashiq nahi, parwana nahi x (2)

Mili jabse nazar tabse jaan-e-jigar
Mili jabse nazar tabse jaan-e-jigar
Main ho gaya deewana
Main ho gaya deewana
Ab jaane kya hoga jaan-e-jana

Tumse milne ki tamanna hai
Pyar ka irada hai
Aur ek vaada hain jaanam x (2)

Kya pata phir kaha kab mulakaat ho
Woh haseena se phir dil ki baat ho x (2)

Uske jaisi haseen maine dekhi nahi
Uske jaisi haseen maine dekhi nahi
Rokega kya zamana
Maine dil mein hai thana
Mujhko use hai abhi apna banana

Tumse milne ki tamanna hai
Pyar ka irada hai
Aur ek vaada hain jaanam x (2)

Jo kabhi hum mile
To zamana dekhega apna pyar
Ho mere yaar, ho mere yaar

Synopsis:
Choices... to choose between right or wrong is simple, but what defines one's life is the decision between the greater of two goods or the lesser of two evils. This is the advice that Zooni Ali Beg (Kajol) receives from her father just as she is about to venture out into the world of her own for the very first time. Little does she know that these very words will shape her life.

Zooni, a blind Kashmiri girl, meets Rehan Qadri (Aamir Khan), a local Delhi tour guide and an incorrigible flirt. Her friends warn her against this good-for-nothing roadside Romeo, but she chooses to ignore them. It is now her time to discover life and love. Is this really the right choice?

Rehan is fascinated by Zooni and wants her to see life as it should be seen, in its many colours. He promises her that the time spent with him will be the most precious in all her life. Zooni sees Delhi, life and love like she never has before, because of Rehan.

What Zooni doesn't know is that Rehan has another side of his life that he has kept from her - something that can not only change her life, but can also destroy it.

Synopsis:
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh (Shah Rukh Khan) is a rescue pilot with the Indian Air Force. In the line of duty he comes across a stranded Zaara (Preity Zinta)... a girl from Pakistan who has come to India to fulfill her surrogate mothers dying wish. Veer saves her life and his life is never the same again.

Twenty two years later Saamia Siddiqui (Rani Mukerji), a Pakistani human rights lawyer on her first case, finds herself face to face with an aging Veer Pratap Singh. He has languished in a Pakistan jail cell for 22 years and has not spoken to anyone all these years. And no one knows why. Her mission is to discover the truth about Veer and see to it that justice is served.

VEER-ZAARA is a saga of love, separation, courage and sacrifice. A love that is divine, a love that is whole-hearted, a love that is completely consuming, a love that grows with separation & deepens with sacrifice. A love that is an inspiration... and will remain a legend forever.

Synopsis:
DIL TO PAGAL HAI is the story of Rahul (Shah Rukh Khan), who does not believe in love. Rahul fails to understand how two people can spend their lives together.

It is the story of Pooja (Madhuri Dixit), who believes that there is someone who is made for her and she is destined to meet that person.

It is also the story of Nisha (Karisma Kapoor) who believes that love is friendship and one day her dream will come true.

Dil To Pagal Hai is a grand musical about passionate people with dreams. Will their dreams come true? Will they find their true love?

Dil To Pagal Hai makes us believe that - someone... somewhere... is made for us.

Synopsis:
Why do girls always fall for the wrong guy? Their mothers warn them about him. Their friends shake their heads disapprovingly. Their minds tell them to escape while the going is good. But no! oh no! Their hearts are another story. You see, they are sending all the wrong signals. His name alone is enough to scramble their brains and set their hearts racing.

Meet Raj. He is the stuff of dreams, with the looks of a ‘butter wouldn’t melt in my mouth’ good boy.

Who can blame him for falling in love as many times as love is fortunate enough to find him. It’s not his fault that he’s a heartbreaker, it’s in his DNA.

Come discover his three love stories; Raj and Mahi, Raj and Radhika, Raj and Gayatri. Different ladyloves at different times in his life. And each of them, teach him a little bit about love and a little bit about life, in their own sweet, sexy or sassy way.

Come fall in love... three times..

►Letra / lyrics:
Es tan mágico cómo todo pasó
En nuestro amor, nuestro dulce amor
Y es tan fácil que ya nada me sorprende
En nuestro amor, este increíble amor

Y todo fue como en un sueño
En nuestro amor
Todo va sucediendo

Y es así, así es
Y no hay nada que hacerle
Y es así, así es
Es así como sucede este amor
Este amor

Es tan sencillo que no sé cómo explicar
Nuestro amor, nuestro dulce amor
Y no sé cuánto tiempo dure el amor
Pero hoy no hay nada mejor

Y todo fue como en un sueño
En nuestro amor
Todo va sucediendo

Y es así, así es
Y no hay nada que hacerle
Y es así, así es
Es así como sucede este amor
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Y es así, así es
Y no hay nada que hacerle
Y es así, así es
Es así como sucede este amor
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Nada que hacerle (este amor)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Este amor
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yo digo R, tú dices...

Lyrics:
Dekh Ke Tujhko Dil Bole Haye Haye
Tere Bina Haal Mera Bura Hota Jaye Jaye
Thodi Sharaarti Main Tu Bhi Thoda Shy Shy
Tere Liye Baakiyon Ko Kiya Maine Bye Bye
Aisa Kaisa Ye Pyaar Kar Lia.. Ohh Ohh

Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya 
Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya 

Tujhpe Aake Naina Meri Jaam Ho Gaye
Samajh Mein Na Aaye Aise Kaam Ho Gaye
Naam Bohot Tha Tere Sar Ki Kasam Sajan
Pade Jo Tere Pyaar Mein Badnaam Ho Gaye

Rehliya Duniya Se
Badaa Dar Dar Ke
Dekhun Main Bhi Zaraa
Had Se Guzar Ke
Sab Kuch Tere Naam Kar Diya

Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya 
Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya 

Dhadhke Dil Ye Jab Udhey Tera Aanchal
Jadoo Kare Teri Aankhon Ka Kaajal
Dekh Ke Tujh Ko Hua Jaun Paagal
Naajaney Kab Barsega Ye Badal

Kuch Toh Hua Mujhe Aankh Jab Tujhse Ladhi
Teri Deewangi Bhi Sar Pe Mere Chadhi
Main Bhi Hoon Zidd Pe Adha Tu Bhi Hai Zidd Pe Adhi
Kisine Bhi Na Badayi Baat Ye Khud Se Badhi
Ye Ishq Sare Aam Kar Lia..

Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya 
Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya Saawariya

 ABOUT IRON MAIDEN:
Iron Maiden are an institution. Over the course of six decades they have come to embody a spirit of fearless creative independence, ferocious dedication to their fans, and a cheerful indifference to their critics that’s won them a following that spans every culture, generation, and time-zone. A story of gritty determination and courageous defiance of the naysayers, theirs has been an adventure like no other.

The band’s immense discography includes the studio albums ‘The Number Of The Beast’, ‘Piece Of Mind’, ‘Powerslave, ‘Somewhere In Time’, ‘Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son’, ‘Fear Of The Dark’, ‘The Final Frontier’ and ‘The Book Of Souls’ which have spawned many classic hits as ‘The Trooper’, ‘Wasted Years’, ‘Hallowed Be Thy Name’, ‘Wasting Love’, ‘Run To The Hills’, ‘Aces High’, ‘Rime Of The Ancient Mariner’ and ‘2 Minutes to Midnight’.

Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time.
'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole,
The sands of time for me are running low...

Running low--ooohhh...
When the priest comes to read me the last rites,
I take a look through the bars at the last sights,
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me.

Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror.
Is this really the end, not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming,
It's not easy to stop from screaming,
But words escape me when I try to speak.
Tears flow but why am I crying?
After all I'm not afraid of dying.
Don't I believe that there never is an end?

As the guards march me out to the courtyard,
Somebody cries from a cell ""God be with you"".
If there's a God then why does he let me go?

As I walk my life drifts before me.
Though the end is near I'm not sorry.
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away.

Mark my words believe my soul lives on.
Don't worry now that I have gone.
I've gone beyond to see the truth.

When you know that your time is close at hand,
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion.

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah...Hallowed be Thy name

 ABOUT IRON MAIDEN:
Iron Maiden are an institution. Over the course of six decades they have come to embody a spirit of fearless creative independence, ferocious dedication to their fans, and a cheerful indifference to their critics that’s won them a following that spans every culture, generation, and time-zone. A story of gritty determination and courageous defiance of the naysayers, theirs has been an adventure like no other.

The band’s immense discography includes the studio albums ‘The Number Of The Beast’, ‘Piece Of Mind’, ‘Powerslave, ‘Somewhere In Time’, ‘Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son’, ‘Fear Of The Dark’, ‘The Final Frontier’ and ‘The Book Of Souls’ which have spawned many classic hits as ‘The Trooper’, ‘Wasted Years’, ‘Hallowed Be Thy Name’, ‘Wasting Love’, ‘Run To The Hills’, ‘Aces High’, ‘Rime Of The Ancient Mariner’ and ‘2 Minutes to Midnight’.

WOMAN
Woman, I can hardly express
My mixed emotions at my thoughtlessness
After all, I'm forever in your debt
And woman, I will try to express
My inner feelings and thankfulness
For showing me the meaning of success
Oooh ooh,  well well, do do do doo doo
Oooh ooh,  well well, do do do doo doo

Woman, I know you understand
The little child inside the man
Please remember, my life is in your hands
And woman, hold me close to your heart
However distant don't keep us apart
After all, it is written in the stars
Oooh ooh,  well well, do do do doo doo
Oooh ooh,  well well, do do do doo doo

Woman, please let me explain
I never meant to cause you sorrow or pain
So let me tell you again and again and again

I love you, yeah yeah, now and forever
I love you, yeah yeah, now and forever
I love you, yeah yeah, now and forever
I love you, yeah yeah, now and forever

ABOUT THE SONG
John: ‘One sunny afternoon in Bermuda, it suddenly hit me what women do for us… everything that I was taking for granted – because that’s the way we were brought up. My history of relationships with women is very poor – very macho, very stupid, but pretty typical of a certain type of man, which I was, I suppose – a very insecure, sensitive person acting out very aggressive and macho. Trying to cover up the feminine side, which I still have a tendency to do, but I'm learning. I'm learning that it's all right to be soft and allow that side of me out. Women really are the other half of the sky, as I whisper at the beginning of the song. It’s a 'we' or it ain’t anything.'

ABOUT THE VIDEO
The video for 'Woman' was directed and edited by Yoko Ono Lennon as a tribute to John in early 1981, during a very raw time soon after John's murder, while Yoko was still in mourning. The footage of John & Yoko together had been directed by their old friend, photographer Ethan Russell on 26 November 1980 - a sunny autumn day in Central Park in the area that would later be called 'Strawberry Fields' and at the Sperone Westwater Fischer Gallery at 142 Greene Street in SoHo, New York. There are further shots of a grieving Yoko (in a white fur coat or grey jacket), directed by Yoko and filmed at the Dakota and alone on the benches at Strawberry Fields in January 1981, that are combined with album covers, artwork, and a selection of photos by John, Bob Gruen, Nishi F. Saimaru, David Nutter, Kishin Shinoyama, Iain Macmillan, David Spindel, Paul Goresh and others. The video was remastered in 2003 from all the original footage and further enhanced in HD in 2019.

BEAUTIFUL BOY (DARLING BOY)
Close your eyes have no fear
The monster's gone, he's on the run and your daddy's here
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy

Before you go to sleep, say a little prayer
Every day in every way it's getting better and better
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy

Out on the ocean, sailing away
I can hardly wait to see you come of age
But I guess we'll both just have to be patient

Because it's a long way to go, a hard row to hoe
Yes, it's a long way to go, but in the meantime...

Before you cross the street, take my hand
Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy
Darling, darling, darling, darling Sean

John Lennon: ""The joy is still there when I see Sean. He didn't come out of my belly but by God, I made his bones!  Because I've attended to every meal, and to how he sleeps, and to the fact that he swims like a fish. That's because I took him to the 'Y' [the swimming pool at 92nd St]. I took him to the ocean. I'm so proud of those things. He is my biggest pride, you see.""

JEALOUS GUY
I was dreaming of the past and my heart was beating fast
I began to lose control, I began to lose control
I didn't mean to hurt you, I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you, I'm just a jealous guy

I was feeling insecure - you might not love me anymore
I was shivering inside, I was shivering inside
I didn't mean to hurt you, I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you, I'm just a jealous guy

I was trying to catch your eyes - thought that you were trying to hide 
I was swallowing my pain, I was swallowing my pain
I didn't mean to hurt you, I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you, I'm just a jealous guy

(JUST LIKE) STARTING OVER
Our life together is so precious together
We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone

It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

Every day we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

Why don't we take off alone
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together on our own again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well, well darling

Our life together is so precious together
We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone

It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

IMAGINE
Imagine there's no heaven, it's easy if you try
No hell below us, above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today...

Imagine there's no countries, it isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for, and no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace...

Imagine no possessions, I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger - a brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world... 

You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us and the world will live as one

written by John Lennon & Yoko Ono 

ABOUT IMAGINE
John: ‘Imagine’ is a song conceived in my head without melody. The first verse came to me very quickly in the form of a childlike street chant ‘da da da da da dee dee da dee da ee a eeeh’. The piano intro I’ve had hanging around in my head for a few years – the chords and melody followed naturally from this. 

The middle eight was ‘conceived’ to finish off the song. I think it works as a song. Of course, there is always room for improvement – otherwise I wouldn’t make any more. The third verse came to me in an eight-seater plane. It’s a song for children.

Yoko: ‘Cloud Piece’: ‘Imagine the clouds dripping, dig a hole in your garden to put them in.’ This is not a piece of poetry. Poetry to me is nouns or adjectives. This is verbs. And you have to do them. These are all instructions and when you just do it, then you start to understand it.

John: ‘Imagine’ was inspired by Yoko’s Grapefruit. There’s a lot of pieces in it saying like ‘Imagine this’ or ‘Imagine that’. If you get a copy of Grapefruit and look through, you’ll see where I was influenced by her. ‘Imagine’ could never have been written without her. And I know she helped on a lot of the lyrics but I wasn’t man enough to let her have credit for it. So that song was actually written by John & Yoko, but I was still selfish enough and unaware enough to take her contribution without acknowledging it. The song itself expresses what I’d learned through being with Yoko and my own feelings on it. It should really have said ‘Lennon/Ono’ on that song, because she contributed a lot of that song.

Alan White (drummer): Every song we did on Imagine, John would make us read the lyrics and insist that we understood the meaning of the song before started playing it. That had quite an impact for me.

Klaus Voormann (bass): When we played ‘Imagine’ and heard the lyrics, the possibility that this was going to be such a big song was apparent. It definitely was. I even thought I didn’t want to play on it because it was so amazing with just John playing piano. It was so true and honest. That would have been enough. I hope you’ve got a version of just John playing it.

Phil McDonald (engineer): ‘Imagine’ was one of the easiest tracks to record, almost all live, in a few takes. We mixed the track at Tittenhurst and Phil Spector added strings on top of the stereo tape in the USA.

Yoko: John and I were both artists and we were living together, so we inspired each other. And the song ‘Imagine’ embodied what we believed together at the time. John and I met – he comes from the West and I come from the East – and still we are together. We have this oneness and ‘the whole world would eventually become one’ is the sense that we will all be café-au-lait colour and we will all be very happy together. All these instructions are for people for how to spend eternity, because we have lots of time.

John: If you can imagine a world of peace, if you can imagine a world with no denominations of religion – not without religion, whatever religion is – but without this divisive ‘My god is bigger than your god’ business.... Then, if you can imagine the possibility, then it can be true.

Yoko: ‘Imagine’ is a complete vision. A succinct bible of truth. It will start to unfold as you believe in it. The film? Well, it just happened naturally. I was well aware of the symbolism of everything – closing and then opening the shutters to let the light in. It’s rather personal, but I had a definite reason why I smiled at the end, in addition to loving being next to John.

As soon as your born they make you feel small, 
By giving you no time instead of it all, 
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all, 
A working class hero is something to be, 
A working class hero is something to be. 
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school, 
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool, 
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules, 
A working class hero is something to be, 
A working class hero is something to be. 
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years, 
Then they expect you to pick a career, 
When you can't really function you're so full of fear, 
A working class hero is something to be, 
A working class hero is something to be. 
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV, 
And you think you're so clever and classless and free, 
But you're still fucking peasents as far as I can see, 
A working class hero is something to be, 
A working class hero is something to be. 
There's room at the top they are telling you still, 
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill, 
If you want to be like the folks on the hill, 
A working class hero is something to be. 
A working class hero is something to be. 
If you want to be a hero well just follow me, 
If you want to be a hero well just follow me.",False,False,34972418.0,rock music

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Can you feel that?
Ah, shit

Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!
Oh, oh! Oh, oh!
Oh, oh!

[Verse 1]
Drowning deep in my sea of loathing
Broken, your servant, I kneel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems what's left of my human side
Is slowly changing in me
(Will you give in to me?)

Looking at my own reflection
When, suddenly, it changes
Violently, it changes
Oh, no, there is no turning back now
You've woken up the demon in me

[Chorus]
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me

[Verse 2]
I can see inside you, the sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems that all that was good has died
And is decaying in me
(Will you give in to me?)

It seems you're having some trouble
In dealing with these changes
Living with these changes
Oh, no, the world is a scary place
Now that you've woken up the demon in me

[Chorus]
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me

[Bridge]
And when I dream...
And when I dream...
And when I dream...
And when I dream...

[Bridge]
No, Mommy, don't do it again!
Don't do it again, I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, I promise!
No, Mommy, don't hit me!
Why did you have to hit me like that, Mommy?
Don't do it, you're hurting me!
Why did you have to be such a bitch?
Why don't you? Why don't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just leave here and die?
Never stick your hand in my face again, bitch!
Fuck you! I don't need this shit!
You stupid, sadistic, abusive, fucking whore!
How would you like to see how it feels, Mommy?
Here it comes, get ready to die!

[Hook]
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!

[Chorus]
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness has now come over me

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a blood stained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention

[Chorus]
The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

[Verse 2]
You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know why your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless

[Chorus]
The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run
Into the abyss will I run!

[Verse 1]
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a blood stained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
Don't want to mention

[Chorus]
The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

[Outro]
Into the abyss will I run
I can't let you go
Yes, I am stricken and can't let you go

Lyrics:
Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping

And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp

When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening

People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, """"You do not know
Silence, like a cancer, grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""""

But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said
""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sound
Of silence""

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Another mission, the powers have called me away
Another time to carry the colors again
My motivation: an oath I've sworn to defend
To win the honor of coming back home again
No explanation will matter after we begin
Unlock the dark destroyer that's buried within
My true vocation, and now, my unfortunate friend
You will discover a war you're unable to win

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll have you know that I've become

[Chorus 1]
Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war

[Verse 2]
Another reason, another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered now for me to light
My dedication to all that I've sworn to protect
I carry out my orders without a regret
My declaration embedded deep under the skin
A permanent reminder of how it began
No hesitation when I am commanded to strike
You need to know that you're in for the fight of your life

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You will be shown how I've become

[Chorus 1]
Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war

[Chorus 2]
I'm indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I am indestructible (Indestructible)

[Chorus 1]
Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
He is observing the chaos, taking in the lack of raw humanity
It's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity
Hear the innocent voices scream
As their tormentors laugh through all of it
No forgiveness from all I've seen
The degradation, I cannot forget

[Pre-Chorus]
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

[Chorus]
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

[Verse 2]
As the violence surges
And the teeming masses have been terrorized
The human predators all gone mad
Are reaping profits born from their demise
The rabid media plays their roles
Stoking the flames of war to no surprise
Only too eager to sell their souls
For the apocalypse must be televised

[Pre-Chorus]
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

[Chorus]
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

[Bridge]
When you die, you'll know why
For you cannot be saved
With all the world enslaved
When you die, you'll know why
You'll die, you'll know why
For you cannot be saved
This world is too depraved
When you die, you'll know why

[Chorus]
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I must’ve dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They’re moving into the street
Now, did you read the news today?
They say the danger’s gone away
But I can see the fire’s still alight
There, burning into the night

[Pre-Chorus]
There’s too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And there’s not much love to go ‘round
Can’t you see
This is a land of confusion?

[Chorus]
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we’re given
Use them, and let’s start trying
To make it a place worth living in

[Verse 2]
Ooh, Superman, where are you now?
When everything’s gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the time
This is the place
So, we look for the future
But there’s not much love to go ‘round
Tell me why this is a land of confusion

[Chorus]
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we’re given
Use them and let’s start trying
To make it a place worth living in

[Bridge]
I remember long ago
Ooh, when the sun was shining
And all the stars were bright
All through the night
In the wake of this madness
As I held you tight
So long ago

[Verse 3]
I won’t be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We’re not just making promises
That we know we’ll never keep

[Pre-Chorus]
Too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go ‘round
Can’t you see
This is a land of confusion?

[Chorus]
Now, this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we’re given
Use them, and let’s start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for

This is the world we live in
And these are the names we’re given
Stand up and let’s start showing
Just where our lives are going to

*******************

The Doors channel is the official YouTube home of classic Doors live performances, The Doors albums, and contemporary performances and content honoring The Doors featuring John Densmore and Robby Krieger. 

With an intoxicating, genre-blending sound, provocative and uncompromising songs, and the mesmerizing power of singer Jim Morrison’s poetry and presence, The Doors had a transformative impact not only on popular music but on popular culture.

The Doors’ arrival on the rock scene in 1967 marked not only the start of a string of hit singles and albums that would become classics, but also of something much bigger – a new and deeper relationship between creators and audience. Refusing to be mere entertainers, the Los Angeles quartet relentlessly challenged, confronted and inspired their fans, leaping headfirst into the heart of darkness while other bands warbled about peace and love. Though they’ve had scores of imitators, there’s never been another band quite like them.",True,True,212048011.0,blues rock

Combining early TV appearances with their own music films it illustrates how The Doors evolved from the constraints of late sixties television to a point where they had the creative input and power to shape how they were portrayed on screen. Throughout the unique charisma and talent of The Doors comes across, whether it be on a lightweight pop show or on a film created from their own imaginations, along with some of the most influential music ever made.

Order the 25th anniversary album:  http://found.ee/REM-automatic25-r

R.E.M. is excited to announce the reissue of their landmark album Automatic For The People to commemorate the record's 25th Anniversary. Due November 10 via Craft Recordings, the remastered album will be available in a variety of formats, the most extensive of which is the Deluxe Anniversary Edition, which will feature the album in its entirety mixed in Dolby Atmos.
 
The album (plus bonus track “Photograph,” featuring Natalie Merchant) was remixed in Dolby Atmos by Automatic’s original producer, Scott Litt, and engineer, Clif Norrell. This technology delivers a leap forward from surround sound with expansive, flowing audio that immerses the listener far beyond what stereo can offer. It transports the listener inside the recording studio with multi-dimensional audio – evoking a time when listening to music was an active, transformative experience, and reigniting the emotion you felt when you first heard the album in 1992.  R.E.M.’s Automatic For The People is the first album to be commercially released in this expressive, breathtaking format.

In addition, the 4-disc Deluxe Edition will offer a wealth of previously unreleased material. The band selected 20 never-before-heard demos from the LP’s sessions, including the fully-realized, unreleased track “Mike’s Pop Song” and the oft-mused about song, “Devil Rides Backwards.”

R.E.M. is excited to announce the reissue of their landmark album Automatic For The People to commemorate the record's 25th Anniversary. Due November 10 via Craft Recordings, the remastered album will be available in a variety of formats, the most extensive of which is the Deluxe Anniversary Edition, which will feature the album in its entirety mixed in Dolby Atmos.
 
The album (plus bonus track “Photograph,” featuring Natalie Merchant) was remixed in Dolby Atmos by Automatic’s original producer, Scott Litt, and engineer, Clif Norrell. This technology delivers a leap forward from surround sound with expansive, flowing audio that immerses the listener far beyond what stereo can offer. It transports the listener inside the recording studio with multi-dimensional audio – evoking a time when listening to music was an active, transformative experience, and reigniting the emotion you felt when you first heard the album in 1992.

Lyrics:
Time, it needs time to win back your love again
I will be there, I will be there
Love, only love can bring back your love someday
I will be there, I will be there

Fight, babe, I'll fight to win back your love again
I will be there, I will be there
Love, only love can bring down the wall someday
I will be there, I will be there

If we go again all the way from the start
I would try to change the things that killed our love
Your pride has built a wall, so strong that I can't get through
Is there really no chance to start once again? I'm loving you

Try, baby, try to trust in my love again
I will be there, I will be there
Love, our love just shouldn't be thrown away
I will be there, I will be there

If we'd go again, all the way from the start
I would try to change the things that killed our love
Yes, I've hurt your pride, and I know what you've been through
You should give me a chance, this can't be the end

LYRICS:
It´s early morning
The sun comes out
Last night was shaking
And pretty loud
My cat is purring
And scratches my skin
So what is wrong
With another sin
The bitch is hungry
She needs to tell
So give her inches
And feed her well
More days to come
New places to go
I´ve got to leave
It´s time for a show

Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

My body is burning
It starts to shout
Desire is coming
It breaks out loud
Lust is in cages
Till storm breaks loose
Just have to make it
With someone I choose
The night is calling
I have to go
The wolf is hungry
He runs the show
He´s licking his lips
He´s ready to win
On the hunt tonight
For love at first sting

Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane",False,True,,hard rock

LYRICS:
When the daylight is falling down into the night
And the sharks try to cut a big piece out of life
It feels alright to go out to catch an outrageous thrill
But it´s more like spinning wheels of fortune
Which never stand still

Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights

When the sunlight is rising up in my eyes
And the long night has left me back at somebody´s side
It feels alright for a long sweet minute like hours before
But it´s more like looking out for something
I can´t find anymore

Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
Always yearning

There is no dream
That you can´t make true, if you´re looking for love
But there´s no girl
Who´s burning the ice away from my heart
Maybe tonight!

Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
Always yearning
Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
Always yearning",False,True,,hard rock

Lyrics:

Sunrise, sunrise

Looks like mornin' in your eyes

But the clock's held 9:15 for hours

Sunrise, sunrise

Couldn't tempt us if it tried

'Cause the afternoon's already come and gone

And I said

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

To you

Surprise, surprise

Couldn't find it in your eyes

But I'm sure it's written all over my face

Surprise, surprise

Never something I could hide

When I see we made it through another day

And I said

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

To you

Now the night

Will throw its cover down

On me again

Ooh, and if I'm right

It's the only way

To bring me back

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

To you

Hoo, ooh, yeah

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

To you

Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye
