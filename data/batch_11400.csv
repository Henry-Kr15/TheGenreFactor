Lyrics

I hear voices in my head 
They council me, they understand 
They talk to me 

You got your rules and your religion, 
All designed to keep you safe 
But when rules start getting broken 
You start questioning your faith 
I have a voice that is my savior 
Hates to love and loves to hate 
I have a voice that has the knowledge, 
And the power to rule your fate 
 
I hear voices crying 
I see heroes dying 
I taste blood that’s drying 
I feel tension rising 

I hear voices in my head 
They council me, they understand 
They talk to me, they talk to me. 
They tell me things that I will do 
They show me things I’ll do to you 
They talk to me, they talk to me. 

All the lawyers are defenseless 
All the doctors are disease 
And the preachers all are sinners 
And the police just take the grease 
All you judges, you are guilty 
All the bosses I will fire 
All you bankers will have losses 
And politicians all are liars 

I see darkness falling 
I hear voices calling 
I feel justice crawling 
I see faith has fallen 

I hear voices in my head 
They council me, they understand 
They talk to me, they talk to me. 
They tell me things that I will do 
They show me things I’ll do to you 
They talk to me, they talk to me. 
 
I hear voices in my head 
They council me, they understand 
They talk to me, they talk to me. 
They tell me things that I will do 
They show me things I’ll do to you 
They talk to me, they talk to me. 
 
They show me things I’ll do to you 
They talk to me, they talk to me",True,True,33895442.0,Not Found

Lyrics:

I eat sleep bleed 
The demons in your dreams
I eat sleep bleed 

Look at my eyes 
Look a look alive 
Look at my eyes this 
This is do or die die
Look at my eyes 
Look a look alive 

Rekill all of the devils in me 
I still feel the darkness that lives in me 
Give you chills I take your soul in your sleep 
I'm evil 
There's no escaping from me 

Do or die 

This is my brutality 
The demon in your dreams
You'll hear me in screams 
Insanity 
I am the deadly disease 
I'll put that soul to sleep 
I'll leave you 6 feet deep 
Brutality 

Look at my eyes 
Look a look alive 
Look at my eyes this 
This is do or die die
Look at my eyes 
Look a look alive 
Look at my eyes this 
This is do or die die",True,True,1066812.0,Not Found

Album: Use Your Illusion II, track 12

With an original 4:3 aspect ratio that includes every detail, with the best possible sound and image quality. + uncut, full length, so along with the outro, which many other uploads have unfortunately missed.

Song:

    Axl Rose – lead vocals
    Slash – lead guitar, rhythm guitar
    Izzy Stradlin – rhythm guitar, backing vocals
    Duff McKagan – bass, backing vocals
    Matt Sorum – drums

Video:
""The music video for the song was directed by Andy Morahan, Stan Winston and Jeffrey Abelson. A T-800 Terminator is assembled, given the appearance of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and dispatched to assassinate the band at one of their concerts. The video consists of clips from the movie, including its teaser trailer, intercut with footage of the band performing the song as the T-800 makes his way to the front of the crowd. After the song ends, he confronts the band as they leave the venue through a back door and analyzes each member individually; Izzy Stradlin is absent at this point, replaced by keyboardist Dizzy Reed. The T-800 scans W. Axl Rose last and concludes that killing the band would be a ""Waste of Ammo"". Lowering his shotgun, he gives Rose a brief smirk and walks away.

As the video features clips from the movie, it could not be put on the DVD Welcome to the Videos due to licensing issues. The video was also not included on any of the DVD releases of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, although it was included with a special double tape edition of the film, released on VHS in 1993.""

LETRA / LYRICS:

(Chencho)

Yo siempre la llevo al cielo,
Conmigo quema ella  cada rato,
Se crece y coge vuelo 
porque yo no la celo.

Y cuando estamos en el cuarto, 
no tengo que decirle,
solita rompe el hielo. 

(Anuel)

Sabe dónde poner sus manos,
Yo con mi punto Débil 
por eso no la dejo 
desde hace tiempo frente
al espejo Yooooooo

(Chencho)

Le doy lo que le hace falta,
Dice que la obligo a hacer lo que no debe,
Entre paredes nadie sabe lo que pasa,
Después del primer beso nada la detiene,
Soy la razón por la que ella pierde la calma.

No se conforma una noche no es suficiente. 
Al despedirnos no deja que yo me vaya.
Dice que conmigo se siente diferente.
Me daña la mente que lo diga así.

(Anuel)

La que no chiche…
Quédate en tu casa.
Bebe y se pone cuatro letras como NASA. (Uy)
Chingando sin condones,
las Plan B nunca fracasan. (Brrr)
Me lo mama a dos manos 
y hasta lo abraza.

Ella es una hija e’ puta como Tokio. 
Después que se lo meto,
la mando pa donde el novio.
Y le preguntan que si chingo rico,
y dice obvio. 

Un polvo no es un polvo
si no jode el matrimonio.
Y le gusta chingar arrebata,
perriando sucio tu eres es senda bellaca. (Llaca)
Ñengo lo dijo que chocha con bicho y bicho con nalga,
y si eres chumba pues mueve la espalda .

Mami yo no disimulo, (tra) que Dios bendiga ese culo. (Ay papi)
Te lambo toa’ y te enchulo… (ahhh)
Se va a venir y grita…(Bien duro)

(Ñengo)

Yo siempre la llevo al cielo.
Conmigo quema ella a cada rato. 
Se crece y coge vuelo 
porque yo no la celo.

Y cuando estamos en el cuarto, 
no tengo que decirle,
solita rompe el hielo.

Sabe dónde poner sus manos
Yo con mi punto Débil 
Por eso no la dejo 
Desde hace tiempo frente
Al espejo Yoooooooo

(Chencho)

Le doy lo que le hace falta
Dice que la obligo a hacer lo que no debe
Entre paredes nadie sabe lo que pasa,
después del primer beso nadie la detiene.
Soy la razón por la que ella pierde la calma.

No se conforma una noche no es suficiente. 
Al despedirnos no deja que yo me vaya.
Dice que conmigo se siente diferente.
Me daña la mente que lo diga así.

(Ñengo)

Solo tuyo. 
Viajando por las nubes, 
ya el cielo se cayó.
Dame tu cuerpecito,
ya la bomba estalló.
Tú sabes que yo estoy pa ti. 
Te voy a hacer cosas diferentes
y no te olvidaras de mi.


Contigo a las alturas mami elévame
Si sabes lo que haces pues enamórame
Yo se que tu cuerpo ya esta pidiendo sexo 
Fuego y beso?

Lo de lo tuyo y mío eso es un desafío. 
A Veces maquino solo y cuando me acuerdo me rio
Las veces que a tu casa le he llegao’
Amaneció’ y he brincao’ los portones por el monte
Y en tu cama te he partió . 
Toma que esté blunt esta encendio’
Mami ponte ready.
Hijo e’ puta como yo no te ha comio’.
El perfume que regaste por tu cuello,
Se enredo por tu cabello 
y tengo ganas de lamberte como un sello.

(Chencho)

Cuando la tengo me dice hálame el pelo
Grita que rico me la como mil veces
Nos devoramos sin decir amor te quiero 
Pero sabemos que las ganas crecen y crecen

Cuando la tengo me dice hálame el pelo
Grita que rico me la como mil veces
Nos devoramos sin decir amor te quiero 
Pero sabemos que las ganas crecen y crecen

(Anuel)

Yo siempre la llevo al cielo
Conmigo ella quema a cada rato 
Se crece y coge vuelo 
Porque yo no la celo

Y cuando estamos en el cuarto 
No tengo que decirle
Solita rompe el hielo

Sabe dónde poner sus manos.
Yo con mi punto G
y por eso no la dejo 
desde hace tiempo frente
al espejo Yooooo 

(Chencho)

Le doy lo que le hace falta…
(Inintelegible) FXs
….Dice que la obligo a hacer lo que no debe
Entre paredes nadie sabe lo que pasa
Después del primer beso nada la detiene…
…Cielo…..

Letra: 
[Intro: Randy Nota Loca & Jowell]
Bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla
Ey, yo', yo', yo'
Yo', yo', yo', yo', yah
Lalalalalalala (Blow, blow)
Lalalalalalala

[Refrán: Randy Nota Loca & Jowell]
Diablo, qué safaera
Tú tiene' un culo cabrón
Cualquier cosa que te ponga' rompe la carretera (Lalalalala; aight)
Muévelo, muévelo, muévelo, muévelo (Lalalalalalala)
Qué safaera (Lalalalala)
Tiene' un culo cabrón
Cualquier cosa que te ponga' rompe la carretera (Aight; ¡tra!)
Muévelo, muévelo, muévelo, muévelo

[Verso 1: Randy Nota Loca]
Qué falta de respeto, mami
¿Cómo te atreve' a venir sin panty?
Hoy saliste puesta pa' mí
Yo que pensaba que venía a dormir, no
Vino ready ya, puesta pa' una cepillá'
Me chupa la lollipop, solita se arrodilla, hey
¿Cómo te atreve', mami, a venir sin panty?


[Interludio: Ñengo Flow & Bad Bunny]
Mera, dímelo, DJ Orma
¿Qué tú te cree'? Jodío' cabrón, jeje
Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana
Díselo, Conejo
Ey, ey (Jajajaja)

[Coro: Bad Bunny & Ñengo Flow]
Hoy se bebe, hoy se gasta
Hoy se fuma como un rasta
Si Dio' lo permite (Si Dio' lo permite), ey
Si Dio' lo permite (Que si Dio' lo permite), ey
Hoy se bebe, hoy se gasta
Hoy se fuma como un rasta (Woo, woo, woo)
Si Dio' lo permite (Jajajajaja), ey
Si Dio' lo permite (Yo', yo'), ey

[Verso 2: Ñengo Flow]
Real G, orientando la' generacione' nueva', con la verdadera
Bellaqueo a lo galactic
Sí, pa' que se te mojen los panty
Métele bellaco a lo versátil
Má' puta que Betty Boop
La que se puso bellaca, mami, fuiste tú
Sigo matando con la U
Chocha con bicho, bicho con nalga (Empuja)
Cho-Chocha con bicho, bicho con nalga, sí (Empuja)
Chocha con bicho, bicho con nalga (Empuja)
Te-Teta' rozando mis tetilla' (Empuja)
Este año no quiero putilla' (Empuja)
Te ven con mucha' prenda' y te quieren pegar (Empuja)
Te ven bien activa'o y te quieren pegar (Empuja)
Porque está' bien buena, porque está' bien buena (Empújamelo completo)
Teta' bien grande' como Lourdes Chacón
Las nalga' bien grande' como Iris Chacón
La chocha no sé porque no la he visto
Pero vamo' pa' la cama a clavarte en panty

[Coro: Randy Nota Loca]
Hoy se bebe, hoy se gasta
Hoy se fuma como un rasta
Si Dio' lo permite
Si Dio' lo permite, yeah-yeah
Y hoy se bebe, hoy se gasta
Hoy se fuma como un rasta
Si Dio' lo permite
Si Dio' lo permite (-te, -te, -te, -te, -te, -te)

[Verso 3: Randy Nota Loca, Bad Bunny & Baby Ranks]
(¡Arr-ugh!)
Mami, ¿qué tú quiere'? Aquí llegó tu tiburón
Yo quiero perrearte y fumarme un blunt
Ver lo que esconde ese pantalón
Yo quiero perrearte y perrearte y perrearte (Duro, duro)
Yo-Yo-Yo quiero perrearte y fumarme un blunt (Duro, duro)
Yo quiero perrearte y perrearte y perrear (Duro, duro)
Yo-Yo-Yo quiero perrearte y fumarme un blunt, -me un blunt (Duro, duro)
La rola ya me explotó
La nena bailando se botó
Ese culo se merece to', se merece to', se merece to', yes
Ese culo se merece to', se merece to', se merece to' (Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)

[Interludio: Bad Bunny]
¡Ah! Yo pensaba que se ponía lenta
'Tá bien, 'tá bien, vamo' de nuevo, de nuevo
Velen a Orma, velen a Orma que está bellaco
Jajajaja (Jajajaja, jajajaja)

[Verso 4: Bad Bunny]
Mi bicho anda fuga'o y yo quiero que tú me lo esconda'
Agárralo como bonga
Se mete una pepa que la pone cachonda
Chinga en lo' Audi, no en lo' Honda, ey (Tra)
Si te lo meto no me llame' (Tra, tra)
Que esto no e' pa' que me ame', ey (Tra, tra)
Si tu novio no te mama el culo
Pa' eso que no mame

[Puente: Bad Bunny]
Baja pa' casa que yo te lambo to'a
Mami, yo te lambo to'a
Baja pa' casa que yo te rompo to'a, ey
Que yo te rompo to'a
Baja pa' casa que yo te lambo to'a (¡Papi, sigue!)
Mami, yo te lambo to'a (¡Papi, sigue!)
Dime, sierva (Papi, sigue)
Si tú fuma' yerba (Papi, pa-papi)

[Verso 5: Jowell]
Jowell, bebé, bebé, bebé, jaja, ¡jajajajaja!
Perreando e' la bichota (¡Duro!)
Se ve que chinga rico en la nota
Yo quiero tirarme un selfie con esa' nalgota' (Tra, tra; wow)
Para'o, para'o, para'o lo tengo, se me nota (Woh, woh)
¿Qué vamo' a hacer con esa' nalgota'? (What?)
En la uni to'a son A, A, A (Tra)
Pero esa' teta' son C
Tú ere' una superbellaca (Wuh), mami, yo lo sé (Eh)
Yo también soy un bellaco (Tra), ¿qué vamo' a hacer? (Tú sabe', eh)
Con ese bum-bum, guíllate, bum-bum
Guíllate ese bum-bum, guíllate, bum-bum
Si tiene' ese bum-bum, guíllate, bum-bum
Si tiene' ese bum-bum, guíllate, ¡buoh!

Hace tiempo que no sube nada
Hoy puso que está soltera
Qué pena me da
De lo que uno se entera, eh eh
Real G4 Life, baby
No sé por qué se dejó (se dejó)
No sé por qué se dejó (sé dejó)
Pero
Qué malo que te dejaste (jajaja)
Del gatito que tenías, porque (baby)
A mí me gustaba darte (tú lo sabes)
Sabiendo que no eras mía y eras de él
Qué malo que te dejaste
Del gatito que tenías, porque
A mí me gustaba darte
Sabiendo que no eras mía y eras de él
Me encantaba castigarte cuando él se iba de la casa (jajaja)
Ese cabrón llamando y yo en tu cuarto dando salsa
Tiene síntoma de venganza y también lanza la vampira
Mai, tú sigue bellaqueando que mi flow nunca se expira (ey)
Quieres bellaqueo
Me dices que te dejaste, yo no lo creo
Si tú eres una diabla en busca de perreo
Yo soy loco con tu piel, tú eres loca con mi maleanteo
Quieres bellaqueo
Me dices que te dejaste, yo no lo creo
Si tú eres una diabla en busca de perreo
Yo soy loco con tu piel, tú eres loca con mi maleanteo (jajaja)
(Real G4 Life, baby)
Qué malo que te dejaste
Del gatito que tenías, porque
A mí me gustaba darte
Sabiendo que no eras mía y eras de él (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Qué malo que te dejaste
Del gatito que tenías, porque

A mí me gustaba darte
Sabiendo que no eras mía y eras de él
Ey, a ti te gustan los bandidos
A mí me gusta lo prohibido
Sin cojones me tiene quedarme escondido
En lo que se iba tu marido, pero
Como quiera te voy a ver, ey
Esta noche te lo voy a poner
Dime, mami, ¿por qué ya no estás con él?
¿O es que van a volver?, Eh
Le gusta chingar en el carro y él se lo tinteó (jajaja)
Pero fui yo quien le metió
Dijo que andaba con Valery, de nuevo mintió (oh)
Se trepó y me lo partió
Ella se la pega y él pide perdón
Diablo, diablo, hay que ser cabrón
Puse algo de bellaquera y lo compartió
Pa mí que se acordó de cuando este bicho sintió
Qué malo que te dejaste
Del gatito que tenías, porque
A mí me gustaba darte
Sabiendo que no eras mía y eras de él
Qué malo que te dejaste
Del gatito que tenías, porque
A mí me gustaba darte
Sabiendo que no eras mía y eras de él

Ñengo Flow - Hoy ft. Bad Bunny [Letra]

[Bad Bunny] 0:0
Hoy yo no me quedo en casa 
Hoy yo salgo a janguear 
Dime Ñengo a cual de to’as esta’ 
Nos vamo’ a llevar 

Va’o llevarno’ a las bellaca’ 
Que están encendida 
Pa’ encerrarnos a chingar 
Todo el día 

Hoy yo quiero beber Hoy yo quiero fumar 
Hoy yo te quiero ver Hoy te lo quiero dar 
De hoy no pasa Que yo te haga mía 
Pa’ hacerte venir Yo tengo to’a las vías 

Ella es modelo y no está en modelaje 
Le gusta irse de viaje 
Se ve bien con y sin maquillaje 
Si,Con y sin traje 
Que te quiere llegar al hospedaje 
Pa’ que la bellaquera le baje 
Dale préndete en lo que yo traje 
Pa’l carajo la prueba de dopaje 

Quiero una foto de tus paisaje’ 
Quiero ver donde a Que tu tiene’ tatuaje’ 
Quiero ver ese kush Te pones salvaje’ 
Ya saque el Mercedes del garaje 
Te llamo cuando Estés pasando el peaje 
Me dice que esta bellaca por mensaje 
Que después del sexo Me da un masaje 
Me dice Estas duro baby no la baje 

[Bad Bunny & Ñengo Flow]
Y Dime Bebe 
En que pose Quieres que yo A ti te mate 
Quiere que cuando Le dé en cuatro Que la retrate 
Pa’ bailar Y pa’ después frontear 
Hoy chingo conmigo Después de janguear 
Yeh Yeh 

Hoy yo quiero beber Hoy yo quiero fumar 
Hoy yo te quiero ver Hoy te lo quiero dar 
De hoy no pasa Que yo te haga mía 
Pa’ hacerte venir Yo tengo to’a las vías 

Tú empieza a tocarte Que voy a matarte 
Es punto y aparte Conozco tu rumbo 
Y si empieza la acción Puedo detonarte 
Calentarte hasta elevarte 
Besarte hasta mojarte 
Abrírtela las dos piernas y secuestrarte 

Tú quieres blond Pues yo lo tengo bebe 
RealG4Life Voy a castigarte bebe 
Erizándote la piel Yo sé que no eres fiel 
Pues si te tiene escucha bien bien 
Las venidas son de 0 a 100 
Jajaja 


Y Dime Bebe 
En que pose Quieres que yo A ti te mate 
Quiere que cuando Le dé en cuatro Que la retrate 
Pa’ bailar Y pa’ después frontear 
Hoy chingo conmigo Después de janguear 
Yeh Yeh 

Hoy yo quiero beber Hoy yo quiero fumar 
Hoy yo te quiero ver Hoy te lo quiero dar 
De hoy no pasa Que yo te haga mía 
Pa’ hacerte venir Yo tengo to’a las vías

Lyrics:
In the whip on a Tuesday night 
Got the music high
And you by my side side
Top down and the moon is high
And the mood is right
And you by my side side
 
Late night conversations
Electric emotions
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex
And it’s a potion
Late night bodies aching
Mental stimulation
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal
And its a moment
 
I been catching love off a back-board
Running from your love that’s what this track for
Fuckin every bitch and never tell ‘em no
I’m pushin p they black and white an oreo
I been catching love off a back-board
Running from your love that’s what this track for
Buying n****s bitches from the corner store
Thug why you wanna do that I don’t need this love
Ball like LeBron James in the finals
We 14-hundred just like a minor
I’m yelling ‘Free Big Meech’ with designers
15 million hoes cause I’m undecided
I’m kicking shit karate ohhhh
I’m serving bricks in somebody hood
Fucked a bitch catch a charlie ohhhh
Gucci flip flops and joggers ooohhh
 
In the whip on a Tuesday night 
Got the music high
And you by my side side
Top down and the moon is high
And the mood is right
And you by my side side
 
Late night conversations Electric emotions
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex
And it’s a potion
Late night bodies aching
Mental stimulation
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal
And its a moment
 
Feeling fly tonight, yeah... yeah
Going with the motherf******g vibe... yeah
It’s going down tonight, oh yeah
Don’t you leave don’t you move, bada bing bada boom bout you
 
In the whip on a Tuesday night 
Got the music high
And you by my side side
Top down and the moon is high
And the mood is right
And you by my side side
 
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex
And it’s a potion
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal
And its a moment

LYRICS
[Intro: Post Malone]
Hey, mm-mm

[Chorus: Post Malone]
We got forty-five bitches just livin' it up
Been too damn long without a sip of my cup
Sayin' one's too many, hunnid isn't enough, alright
Don't worry 'bout 12, no, they ain't showin' up
Rocky came with the shots, Thug came with the blunts
Sayin' one's too many, hunnid isn't enough, alright, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Now, you see, we goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Now, you see, we goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Yeah, one's too many, hunnid isn't enough
Yeah, a hunnid just isn't enough

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Oh hey, lucky girl, okay, whatchu want? Andalé
Got ice on the way, put stones in your face
Calamari, ocean lake, split a million four ways
Vine pavilion, Saint Tropez yeah, alright

Why is it so hard for you to cry when we rich?
I put the sideline in front 'cause I can't argue 'bout shit
I told God, ""Protect my life 'cause I'm gon' come in that shit""
You know I, you know I
She won't fasten up her seatbelt when we ride
Bought the girl a two-story penthouse in the Big Apple like a pie
She was tryna tie me down with all her words, but they were lies
But I let it get away with it 'cause sometimes she wanna die, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
We got forty-five bitches just livin' it up
Been too damn long without a sip of my cup
Sayin' one's too many, hunnid isn't enough, alright (Alright, alright)
Don't worry 'bout 12, no, they ain't showin' up
Rocky came with the shots, Thug came with the blunts
Sayin' one's too many, hunnid isn't enough, alright (Alright, alright), yeah

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Now, you see, we goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Now, you see, we goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Yeah, one's too many, hunnid isn't enough
Yeah, a hunnid just isn't enough

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I'm on my own
Get high with me, we'll levitate
Get high with me for brighter days
Old smile, let me spot a frame
I'm so lit, it could start the campfire
Shorty with ya man, let me stand by ya, well, I'm Mr. Esquire
Seen in fresh attire, do a spin-out in my fresh tire
Red stones, I'm a vampire, it might petrify ya
Uh, whole city goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Whole city goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Uh, new semi goin' dump, dump, dump
Four-fizzy on the pump, pump, pump

[Chorus: Post Malone & Young Thug]
We got forty-five bitches just livin' it up (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Been too damn long without a sip of my cup
Sayin' one's too many, hunnid isn't enough, alright (Alright, alright, yeah)
Don't worry 'bout 12, no, they ain't showin' up (Livin' it up)
Rocky came with the shots, Thug came with the blunts
Sayin' one's too many, hunnid isn't enough, alright (Alright, alright), yeah

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Now, you see, we goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Now, you see, we goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Yeah, one's too many, hunnid isn't enough
Yeah, a hunnid just isn't enough

Lyrics
 
Remember the moment
You left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made 
I was an ocean
Lost in the open 
Nothing could take the pain away
So you can throw me to the wolves 
Tomorrow I will come back 
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue 
Every wound will shape me 
Every scar will build my throne
The sticks and the stones that
You used to throw have
Built me an empire 
So don't even try 
To cry me a river
Cos' I forgive you 
You are the reason I still fight 
I'll leave you choking 
On every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken 
And now you know 
Every wound will shape me 
Every scar will build my throne

Lyrics:
2,3,5!
 
Maybe If I had something to say
Butterfly effect from the last three days now
Maybe if I had something to save
I used to have a soul until I threw it away
There’s shadows on the wall, wish I would’ve ran
Gotta get away I hope you understand
I try to hide my face like a wanted man 
Maybe I’ll be gone before you count to 10
 
I made up my mind this evening
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
Drink while my conscious eats me 
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
This time is the last this time is the last
 
Maybe if we went another way
I wouldn’t be regretting the decisions that I made
I don’t want to spend another day
Looking for somebody that I know I can’t replace
My tears fall you don’t miss me
Put me out my misery
Think my heart is history 
I think I’m broke and nothing can fix me
 
I made up my mind this evening
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
Drink while my conscious eats me 
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
This time is the last this time is the last
 
Yeah
We were built to fall apart
But I can’t feel you now
And it’s too late now there’s no point screaming
Dug your grave so fuck your feelings
No one’s here so now you’re on your own
 
I made up my mind this evening
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
Drink while my conscious eats me 
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
This time is the last this time is the last
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
This time is the last this time is the last

Lyrics:
Maybe I’ll just be fucked up forever
should have figured myself out by now
And I don’t wanna tear myself open, no
But it’s hard to care when you bleed out
 
So won’t you break me down, break me down
Make me get better
I confess I’m a mess
Some kind of error
Well maybe I was destined to disappear
 
We’re just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together
We’re dying to live and we’re living to die
Dying to live, living to die
We’re just a room full of strangers
 
Well I guess my guardian angel missed the memo
‘Cause we’re walking on razors again
And we swore to God we’d never let this happen, no
We dragged ourselves through hell
And we’ll be damned if we go back
 
Break me down
Break me down
Make me get better
I confess that I’m a mess
Some kind of error
Well maybe I was destined to disappear
 
We’re just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together,
We’re dying to live
And we’re living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops
Can’t erase this
So cross out my eyes
Tear the pages
‘Cause you and I
We’re just dying to live
And we’re living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, it don’t
 
Where did we go?
We’re all alone, all alone
No place like home
Take us back to yesterday
S.O.S
Save us from ourselves",True,True,41633701.0,Not Found

Lyrics:
hi  
are you looking for the other side?  
feel like nothing ever seems quite right?  
are you circling the drain pipe, 
getting off on pain like  
you’re corrupted? 
i need to know where your loyalties lie  
tell me are you gonna bark or bite?   
do you really want to twist the knife  
in the belly of the monster?  
get the fuck up  
wake the fuck up  
wipe the system 
and back the fuck up.  
you’re a puppet  
when they cut your strings off 
don’t come crawling back.  

kingslayer  
destroying castles in the sky  
kingslayer  
forevermore the apple of my eye  
i’d sacrifice my life to find you  
angel of the blade  
kingslayer  
come and collect us from the night  

暗い (Cry) 
 この見えない世界 
 まだ消えない未来 
 ただ手に入れたい  

another world  
this world is so dark that i can’t see  
the future won’t disappear  
but i want to obtain  
another world 

system failure   
life 
is encrypted  
you are modified  
like a virus  
in a lullaby  
artificial ‘til the day you die  
silly programme 
you’re corrupted!  
get the fuck up  
wake the fuck up  
wipe the system 
& back the fuck up.  
you’re a puppet  
when they cut your strings off  
don’t come crawling back  
you’re on your own.  
 
さあ 時の 
扉を開けて 
行こうよ 

(now, let’s go 
and open the door of time) 

kingslayer  
destroying castles in the sky  
kingslayer  
i’ll fight for you until i die  
kingslayer  
destroying castles in the sky  
kingslayer  
forevermore the apple of my eye  
i’d sacrifice it all to guide you  
never have to battle alone  
kingslayer  
come and collect us from the night  
this is your wake up call  
we’re going down the rabbit hole  
are you ready?  
i can’t feel you.  
is this what you want?  
this is what you’ll fucking get.

What doesn't kill you 
Makes you wish you were dead 
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper 
And I can't take 
One more moment of this silence 
The loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the worlds getting harder to hold up 
It comes in waves 
I close my eyes
Hold my breath  
And let it bury me 
I'm not alright 
And it's not ok 
Won't you drag the lake 
And bring me home again 
Who will fix me now?
Dive in when I'm down? 
Save me from myself, 
Don't let me drown 
Who will make me fight? 
Drag me out alive? 
Save me from myself, 
Don't let me drown 
What doesn't destroy you 
Leaves you broken instead. 
You know that I can't do this on my own.

Lyrics
My head is haunting me and my heart feels like a ghost. 
I need to feel something cos' I'm still so far from home. 
Cross your heart and hope to die, promise me you'll never leave my side. 
 
Show me what I can't see when the spark in my eyes is gone. 
You got me on my knees, I'm your one man cult. 
Cross my heart and hope to die, promise you I'll never leave your side. 
 
Cos' I'm telling you, you're all I need. 
I promise you, you're all I see. I'll never leave. 
 
So you can drag me through hell, if it meant I could hold your hand. 
I will follow you, cos' I'm under your spell and you can throw me to the flames, I will follow you. 
 
Come sink into me and let me breathe you in. 
I'll be your gravity, you be my oxygen. 
So dig two graves cos' when you die, I swear I'll be leaving by your side.",True,True,187110387.0,Not Found

lyrics:

you know that i’d die for  
i cry for  
you know that i’d die for you  
you know that i breathe for 
i bleed for 
you know that i breathe for you  
let me see my halo  
even though it’s painful  
i’m prepared to lose  
you know that i’d die for  
i cry for  
you know that i’d die for you  
i keep holding my breath for a miracle  
hoping the hole in my heart would have healed somehow  
feeling so fucking close to the edge right now  
you know you’re everything i hate  
wish i could escape  
but you know i would die for you 
cos i’ve died inside  
a thousand times  
but still i kill myself for you   
because the truth of it  
you could slit my wrists  
& i’d write your name in a heart with the haemorrhage  
feeling so fucking close to the edge right now  
i know it’s you i need to kick 
you make me feel like shit 
and i don’t want to die for you   
this isn’t love  
this is a car crash  
this isn’t love  
this is a blood bath  
this isn’t love  
this is a sentence  
it’s a bullet in the head  
so pull the trigger",True,True,59359550.0,Not Found

► Testo

Da Assago a Niguarda
La strada mi guarda
Cat calling su di me
Mi gridano “Marrraaaaaa!” 
Chi è in difficoltà 
Cosa deve fare chi è ricco non sa 
Allacciano un fra
Prima che gli allacciassero il gas 
Ero un re nei miei sogni 
Young boy vedo me nei tuoi occhi 
Abbiamo una malattia
Che non si cura con i soldi
Se ho chiuso contatti 
Bro, l'ho fatto solo per salvarmi
Sono un uomo adesso, odiami che ti amo lo stesso 
Perché il dolore è amore inespresso 

Gioielli e fama
Vuitton e Prada
Non conta nada
Se tu non sei con me 
Qualcuno in meno 
Qualcuno è in cielo
Ho il cuore pieno
Non voglio nuovi friends 
Love 
Per gli amici veri che ho
Per tutte le storie che so 
Pregherò
Per chi nuota ancora nei guai 
Chi vuole scappare e non può
Per tutte le strade in cui sto
Le donne che ho avuto e che avrò 
Pregherò per tutto l’amore che dai 
Sempre più di quello che do’
Love love love 

Solo amore per la gente
Senza apostrofo direi
La strada è la mia donna, frate ucciderei per lei
Lo sai che mi brucia il petto
Per questo love & rispetto
Lo sai che brilla il mio pezzo
Lo sai che resto lo stesso
Colpo caricato sono innamorato della city e del suo corpo del reato 
Sta vita è un campo minato
Per questo ho il cuore spinato
Il mio amore extra, voglio ispirare tutti quei raga che l'hanno persa 
Strada maestra non ti ripaga se solo maestra è la strada 

Da quei portici
In quei vortici
E senza accorgerci 
Siam diventati dei re 
Nei pericoli
Negli ostacoli
Solo i soliti
Non voglio nuovi friends 

Solo amore per queste strade
Per tutta la gente che c’è dall’inizioe per tutti quelli che ho perso lungo il cammino
È stata una lungo viaggio

My enemies really pray for war

[Verse 1: Dave]
Uh, If you wanna get rich, there's a million ways
Sweet chick, familiar face
Wine, I got a brilliant taste
Wine, she got a brilliant waist
Money and fame
My people know struggle and pain
My people nah gon' suffer in vain
Don't call me by my government name
My girl, she badder than Rambo, a rider
Wan-Bissaka, the Lambo a spider
Michael Phelps, the AP a diver
Martial, my right hand, a striker
Tried to call, she blocked me, I Skype her
Damn it, I think that she got me a Lyca
Yeah, I love her, ya pussy me a die for
Rack city, man, I'm comin' like, look

[Chorus: WizKid]
Wine baby, show me that your wine on well
Yeah, show me that wind on well, yeah, yeah, yeah
I never knew about you so well
But money make her kiss and tell, yeah
Only pray for love, God and peace and love
My enemies really pray for war

[Post-Chorus: WizKid]
So i dey give them? (Yeah)
So I dey give them?
One more time when she feelin' it (Yeah)
One more time when she givin' me
One more time when she’s livin' lit
Henny for system, yeah
One more time when she feelin' it
One more time and she givin' it
One more time and we livin' lit

[Verse 2: Dave]
I just caught one wine, now I'm feelin' like an M.V.P
I know that they're talkin' my name
But them man are old news like NBC
Tell the DJ dash 'way his MP3
Who's that girl with a leng black tee?
Wait, what am I sayin', dunda
When I change numbers, I don't send BC's
Listen, it's a big flex if you're talkin' to me
ST, God bless my haters
She wanna do SMS, not save my soul
Thats spend my savings
Waiter, can you bring more champagne in?
For the times I was livin' in stress
I wanna own all my, shh
But the system's built so we're livin' in debt
Men fi rise up 'cause we livin' in, yeah

[Chorus: WizKid]
Wine baby, show me that your wine on well
Yeah, show me that wind on well, yeah, yeah, yeah
I never knew about you so well
But money make her kiss and tell, yeah
Only pray for love, God and peace and love
My enemies really pray for war

[Post-Chorus: WizKid]
So I dey give them? (Yeah)
So I dey give them?
One more time when she feelin' it (Yeah)
One more time when she givin' me
One more time when she’s livin' lit
Henny for system, yeah
One more time when she’s feelin' it
One more time when she givin' me
One more time and we livin' lit

Letra:

Se nota en tu mirada que él no te quiere y que él no lo hará
Y no te vas, tú no te vas
Yo sé que tú no entiendes
Pero él me jura que va cambiar
No sé qué hacer…Ni a quién amar
Él nunca va tratarte mejor; mientras yo estoy loco de amor
Él te niega un beso y yo te doy mucho más que eso
Sabes que me muero por ti, cada vez que me hablas así
Pero tengo dueño, aunque de noche contigo sueño
Contigo yo me he vuelto loca, loca
Y cuando tú me miras mi corazón se explota
En el amor es nuevo y a veces se equivoca
Por ti yo estoy loca…
Contigo yo me he vuelto loco, loco
Supiste enamorarme sin querer poco a poco
Y aunque tú tengas dueño yo también me equivoco,
Por ti yo estoy loco
Y para enamorarse hay que estar loco, loco, loco 
Sígueme, sígueme no pares
Que él y yo no somos iguales
Déjame que cubra tu pena y que la luna llena con un beso te regale.

LYRICS

Ik ga loes
Kom je naar me toe?
Fatigue, oh fatigue
Ik ben zo moe, baby, fatigue
Fatigue, oh fatigue
De vibe is goed maar ben fatigue

Mykonos auf einem Quad
statt Audi RSQ8
Mit paar Promill durch die Noche
Mach alles was ich nicht sollte
Afterparty heut Nacht
Privatpool unter einem Dach
Hab Guapa in meiner Wolke
Sie sagt sie findet mich dolce
Bin mit ihr in meiner Mood
Champagner Flasche halb Full
Sie kommt zu mir in Dessous
Geb ihr ein I LOVE YOU

Ik zit nu in een mood, mood
Mood, moo-ood
Ik zit nu in een moo-moo-moo-, moo-moo-moo-
Moo-moo-moo-, moo-moo-mood

Waar is de drugs, de drugs
Waar is de drugs
We willen niet terug
Niet terug, niet terug

Ik zit nu in een mood
Breng je ziel naar me toe
Want alles wat ik voel
Het gevoel doet me goed
Ik zit nu in een mood, mood
Mood, moo-ood
Ik zit nu in een moo-moo-moo-, moo-moo-moo-
Moo-moo-moo-, moo-moo-mood

Synopsis:
Why do girls always fall for the wrong guy? Their mothers warn them about him. Their friends shake their heads disapprovingly. Their minds tell them to escape while the going is good. But no! oh no! Their hearts are another story. You see, they are sending all the wrong signals. His name alone is enough to scramble their brains and set their hearts racing.

Meet Raj. He is the stuff of dreams, with the looks of a ‘butter wouldn’t melt in my mouth’ good boy.

Who can blame him for falling in love as many times as love is fortunate enough to find him. It’s not his fault that he’s a heartbreaker, it’s in his DNA.

Come discover his three love stories; Raj and Mahi, Raj and Radhika, Raj and Gayatri. Different ladyloves at different times in his life. And each of them, teach him a little bit about love and a little bit about life, in their own sweet, sexy or sassy way.

Come fall in love... three times..

Lyrics:
Meri rooh ka parinda phadphadaye
Lekin sukoon ka jazeera mil na paaye

Ve ki karaan..
Ve ki karaan..

Ik baar ko tajalli toh dikha de
Jhoothi sahi magar tasalli to dila de

Ve ki karaan..
Ve ki karaan..

Raanjhan de yaar Bulleya
Sunle pukaar Bulleya
Tu hi toh yaar Bulleya
Murshid mera, Murshid mera

Tera mukaam kamle
Sarhad ke paar Bulleya
Parvardigar Bulleya
Haafiz tera, Murshid mera 

Main taan gul se lipti
Titli ki tarah muhajir hoon
Ek pal ko thehroon, pal mein udd jaaun
Ve main tan hoon pagdandilabhdi ae jo raah jannat ki
Tu mude jahan main saath mud jaaun

Tere kaarvan mein shamil hona chahun
Kamiya taraash ke main kaabil hona chahun

Ve ki karaan..
Ve ki karaan..

Raanjhan de yaar Bulleya
Sun le pukaar Bulleya
Tu hi toh yaar Bulleya
Murshid mera, Murshid mera
Tera mukaam kamle
Sarhad ke paar Bulleya
Parvardigar Bulleya
Haafiz tera, Murshid mera 

Raanjhana ve
Raanjhana ve

Jis din se aashna se do ajnabi huve hain
Tanhaiyon ke lamhe sab multavi huve hain

Kyun aaj main mohabbat
Phir ek baar karna chahun
Haan

Ye dil toh dhoondhta hai inkaar ke bahane
Lekin ye jism koi pabandiyan na maane

Milke tujhe, bagaawat khud se hi yaar karna chahun

Mujhme agan hai baaki aazma le
Le kar rahi hoon khud ko main tere hawale

Ve Raanjhna
Ve Raanjhna

Raanjhan de yaar Bulleya
Sunle pukaar Bulleya
Tu hi toh yaar Bulleya
Murshid mera, Murshid mera

Tera mukaam kamle
Sarhad ke paar Bulleya
Parvardigar Bulleya
Haafiz tera, Murshid mera

Raanjhan de yaar Bulleya
Sunle pukaar Bulleya
Tu hi toh yaar Bulleya
Murshid mera, Murshid mera

Tera mukaam kamle
Sarhad ke paar Bulleya
Parvardigar Bulleya
Haafiz tera, Murshid mera

Kabhi kabhi laage,
Raha ansuna,
Jo bhi mann mein laage,
Kaha ankaha.  X2

Kinaare, kinaare,
Pe reh gayi, naiyya re,
Savaalo, bhare ho,
Ye Saare, nazare.

Roz roz aate ho, 
Aankhien you churate ho, 
Hai mujhe lage jaise, 
Khud ko hi chhupate ho. X2 

Aisa kya bhala, 
Mann mein khal raha. X2

Jiya jo ye mera, 
Dhoonde lamhe saare, 
Jahaan tu tha mera, 
Wahaan ab dhuaan re. 

Pukaare phire hai, 
Tujhe dill, mera re, 
Savaare Savaare, 
Bheegi ye, ankhiaan re.

Roz roz aate ho, 
Aankhien yu churate ho, 
Hai mujhe lage jaise, 
Khud ko hi chhupate ho. X2

Aisa kya bhala, 
Mann mein khal raha. X2

Saare jahaan re,
Hue jo, hamaare,
Mile hain, vahi pe,
Jahaan dil mila re.

Take a seat
Right over there
Sat on the stairs

Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare
And I'm unaware

Of just how we got,
into this mess
Got so aggressive

I know we meant
All good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
Cos I can't just let you go

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle

Take a step
Back for a minute
Into the kitchen

Floors are wet
Taps are still running
Dishes are broken

How did we get,
into this mess
Got so aggressive

I know we meant
All good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
Cos I can't just let you go

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle

Looking at you I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless my objection

And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin just
Come over, pull me in just...

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle

#MakeYouSay Lyrics:
You’ll miss the weeks the days the hours
When all the loneliness kicks in
You’ll buy them drinks and send them flowers
But they won’t love you like I did
 
You’ll learn one day
I’m one in a million
Maybe in a billion
And when it’s too late
Oh I got a feelin
You’ll be in your feelings
 
Go ahead, Walk away
You’re gonna miss the way
I used to make you say
Oh my god, Night and day
You’re gonna miss the way
I used to make you say
 
We had some highs and lows
And in betweens
We could’ve stayed and worked it out
You got your arms around her when you sleep
But I’m the one you dream about
 
You’ll learn one day
I’m one in a million
Maybe in a billion
And when it’s too late
Oh I got a feelin
You’ll be in your feelings
 
Go ahead, Walk away
You’re gonna miss the way
I used to make you say
Oh my god, Night and day
You’re gonna miss the way
I used to make you say
 
Go ahead walk away
Oh my god, night and day
You’re gonna miss the way I used to make you say
 
Go ahead walk away
Oh my god, night and day
You’re gonna miss the way I used to make you say

Chorus:
But I know, yeah I know it’s a matter of time
Till you walk, till you walk back out of my life
Leave me standing here lonely feeling like a fool
Every time, every time you say we’re done
You come back to the love you were running from
Don’t know why, don’t know why I let you but I do
Guess I love chasing after you

Lyrics:
Verse 1
There are things that I sing that I’d never have the confidence to say
There are things I believe that I only figure out when I sit down to play
The truth don’t scare me in a melody, immortalizing my sincerity
There are things that I sing that I’d never have the confidence to say

Pre-Chorus
Like that song about my parents that I’ll never show ‘em
And the ones about my exes that they don’t deserve
When it comes to you, I’m still trying to find the words 

Chorus
Love too big for a love song
If I tried to sum it up I know I’d get it wrong
Sometimes if it don’t sound right
I apologize, I just said it cause it rhymed
Four chords, three minutes, you never fit in it
So I just take you line by line
Oh, I’ll be writing about you for the rest of my life 
Line by line

Verse 2
There are things that I sing that I’ll never have the confidence to say
Like I’m still not convinced that I won’t be too much for you someday
Yeah we both know the way it works
Hear my fears all on the radio
There are things that I sing that I’ll never have the confidence to say

Chorus
Love too big for a love song
If I tried to sum it up I know I’d get it wrong
Sometimes if it don’t sound right
I apologize, I just said it cause it rhymed
Four chords, three minutes, you never fit in it
So I just take you line by line
Oh, I’ll be writing about you for the rest of my life 
Line by line
I’ll be writing about you for the rest of my life
Line by line
I’ll be writing about you for the rest of my life

Bridge
I know it’s complicated having all your shit on display 
I appreciate the way you make it work
When it comes to you I’m still trying to find the words 

Chorus
Love too big for a love song
If I tried to sum it up I know I’d get it wrong
Sometimes if it don’t sound right
I apologize, I just said it cause it rhymed
Four chords, three minutes, you never fit in it
So I just take you line by line
Oh, I’ll be writing about you for the rest of my life 

Line by line
I’ll be writing about you for the rest of my life
Line by line
I’ll be writing about you for the rest of my life

🎙️Lyrics Sure Thing sped up: 

[Intro]
Love You Like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover

[Refrain]
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that

[Verse 1]
If you be the cash, I'll be the rubber band
You be the match, I will be a fuse, boom!
Painter baby, you could be the muse
I'm the reporter, baby you could be the news
'Cause you're the cigarette and I'm the smoker
We raise a bet 'cause you're the joker
Checked off, you are the chalk and I could be the blackboard
And you can be the talk and I could be the walk

[Chorus]
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it baby simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing

[Refrain]
You could bet that, never got to sweat that
You could bet that, never got to sweat that
You could bet that, never got to sweat that
You could bet that, never got to sweat that

[Verse 2]
You could be the lover I'll be the fighter babe
If I'm the blunt, you could be the lighter babe, fire it up!
Writer babe, you could be the quote
If I'm the lyric baby, you could be the note, record that!
Saint, I'm a sinner, prize, I'm a winner, and it's you
What can I do to deserve that?
Paper baby, I'll be the pen
Say that I'm the one 'cause you are ten
Real and not pretend, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
(You could bet that, never got to sweat that)
Even when we're down to the wire, babe
(You could bet that, never got to sweat that)
Even when it's do or die
(You could bet that, never got to sweat that)
We can do it, babe, simple and plain
(You could bet that, never got to sweat that)
'Cause this love is a sure thing

[Bridge]
Rock with me, baby
Let me hold you in my arms, talk with me, yeah
Rock with me, baby
Let me hold you in my arms, talk with me, baby
This love between you and I, as simple as pie, baby
It's such a sure thing, it's such a sure thing
Oh, is it a sure thing? (It's such a sure thing) Yeah

[Chorus]
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire, babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it, baby, simple and plain
This love is a sure thing

[Outro]
Love you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover

🍃 Lyrics for 'after dark x sweater weather' below:

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand in California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let’s have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity centered
Touch my neck and I’ll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I’m alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I’m so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I’m alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I’m so glad to know

And if I may just take your breath away
I don’t mind if there’s not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue ’cause you love to taste, yeah
These hearts adore, everyone the other beats hardest for

Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn’t wanna tell you about, no, no, no
‘Cause it’s too cold

🍃 This is a mash up cover of After Dark by Mr. Kitty and Sweater Weather by The Neighbourhood.

🎙️Lyrics Sure Thing sped up: 

[Intro]
Love You Like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover

[Refrain]
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that

[Verse 1]
If you be the cash, I'll be the rubber band
You be the match, I will be a fuse, boom!
Painter baby, you could be the muse
I'm the reporter, baby you could be the news
'Cause you're the cigarette and I'm the smoker
We raise a bet 'cause you're the joker
Checked off, you are the chalk and I could be the blackboard
And you can be the talk and I could be the walk

[Chorus]
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it baby simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing

[Refrain]
You could bet that, never got to sweat that
You could bet that, never got to sweat that
You could bet that, never got to sweat that
You could bet that, never got to sweat that

[Verse 2]
You could be the lover I'll be the fighter babe
If I'm the blunt, you could be the lighter babe, fire it up!
Writer babe, you could be the quote
If I'm the lyric baby, you could be the note, record that!
Saint, I'm a sinner, prize, I'm a winner, and it's you
What can I do to deserve that?
Paper baby, I'll be the pen
Say that I'm the one 'cause you are ten
Real and not pretend, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
(You could bet that, never got to sweat that)
Even when we're down to the wire, babe
(You could bet that, never got to sweat that)
Even when it's do or die
(You could bet that, never got to sweat that)
We can do it, babe, simple and plain
(You could bet that, never got to sweat that)
'Cause this love is a sure thing

[Bridge]
Rock with me, baby
Let me hold you in my arms, talk with me, yeah
Rock with me, baby
Let me hold you in my arms, talk with me, baby
This love between you and I, as simple as pie, baby
It's such a sure thing, it's such a sure thing
Oh, is it a sure thing? (It's such a sure thing) Yeah

[Chorus]
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire, babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it, baby, simple and plain
This love is a sure thing

[Outro]
Love you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover

🍃 Lyrics for 'after dark x sweater weather' below:

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand in California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let’s have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity centered
Touch my neck and I’ll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I’m alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I’m so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I’m alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I’m so glad to know

And if I may just take your breath away
I don’t mind if there’s not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue ’cause you love to taste, yeah
These hearts adore, everyone the other beats hardest for

Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn’t wanna tell you about, no, no, no
‘Cause it’s too cold

🍃 This is a mash up cover of After Dark by Mr. Kitty and Sweater Weather by The Neighbourhood.
