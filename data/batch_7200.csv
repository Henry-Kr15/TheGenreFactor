Ela me deu o seu amor, eu tomei
No dia 16 de maio, viajei
Espaçonave atropelado, procurei
O meu amor aperreado
Apenas apanhei na beira-mar
Um táxi pra estação lunar
Apanhei na beira mar
Um táxi.
Bela linda criatura, bonita
Nem menina, nem mulher
Tem espelho no seu rosto de neve
Nem menina, nem mulher
Apenas apanhei na beira-mar
Um táxi pra estação lunar
Apanhei na beira mar
Um táxi...
Pela sua cabeleira, vermelha
Pelos raios desse sol, lilás
Pelo fogo do seu corpo, centelha
Belos raios desse sol
Apenas apanhei na beira-mar
Um táxi pra estação lunar
Apanhei na beira mar
Um táxi...

Lyrics:
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling
She's living, she's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One-stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she say

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there, someplace back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
So slide up 'round the belly face down on the mattress

And I want something else
To get me through this life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there, someplace back there
In the place, we used to start our lives

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
(I want something else)

During this 2019 tour the band donated a portion of the revenue from each ticket sold to off-set their carbon footprint in partnership with ClimeCo. 

Of their latest full album, Screamer, lead singer Stephan Jenkins said: “My current mood resonates with rebellion, energy, courage, and risk.” Adding that “I seek to combine it with a percussive level of musical immediacy in this collection of songs to cultivate collective idealism and an unapologetic aspiration towards humanistic values.”

Lyrics:
I'm only pretty sure that I can't take any more
Before you take a swing
I wonder what are we fighting for
When I say out loud
""I wanna get out of this""
I wonder is there anything
I'm gonna miss

I wonder how it's going to be
When you don't know me
How's it going to be
When you're sure I'm not there?
How's it going to be
When there's no one there to talk to?
Between you and me
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?

Where we used to laugh
There's a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I can't ignore
Like the hammock by the
Doorway we spent time in, swings empty
Don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me

I wonder how's it going to be
When it goes down
How's it going to be
When you're not around?
How's it going to be
When you found out there was nothing
Between you and me?
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be

How's it going to be
When you don't know me anymore?
And how's it going to be?
Wanna get myself back in again
The soft dive of oblivion
I wanna taste the salt of your skin
The soft dive of oblivion (Oblivion)

How's it going to be?
When you don't know me anymore?
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?

In lower Chelsea and I don't know 
What I'm doing in this city 
The sun is always in my eyes 
It crashes through the windows 
And I'm sleeping on the couch 
When I came to visit you 
That's when I knew I could never have you 
I knew that before you did 
Still I'm the one who's stupid 
And there's this burning 
Like there's always been 
I never been so alone 
And I've never been so alive 
Visions of you on a motorcycle drive by 
The cigarette ash flies in your eyes 
And you don't mind, you smile 
And say the world doesn't fit with you 
I don't believe you, you're so serene 
Careening through the universe 
Your axis on a tilt, you're guiltless and free 
I hope you take a piece of me with you 
And there's things I'd like to do 
That you don't believe in 
I would like to build something 
But you never see it happen 
And there's this burning 
Like there's always been 
I've never been so alone 
And I've, I've never been so alive 
And there's this burning 
There is this burning 
Where's the soul I want to know 
New York City is evil 
The surface is everything but I could never do that 
Someone would see through that 
And this is our last time 
We'll be friends again 
I'll get over you, you'll wonder who I am 
And there's this burning 
Just like there's always been 
I've never been so alone alone 
And I've, and I've never been so alive 
So alive 
I go home to the coast 
It starts to rain I paddle out on the water 
Alone 
Taste the salt and taste the pain 
I'm not thinking of you again 
Summer dies and swells rise 
The sun goes down in my eyes 
See this rolling wave

If you think things couldn’t get hotter, then you have no idea what’s coming next on Toolroom. Label founder Mark Knight returns with his most anticipated release yet for 2022 and this time it’s a truly special occasion as Mark enlists Dance Music royalty Armand Van Helden for their debut collaboration, ‘The Music Began To Play’.
 
An artist who needs no introduction, Grammy nominated Armand Van Helden is one of dance music’s most revered figures, with a career spanning 30 years and a vast discography which includes hits such as 90’s classic ‘You Don’t Know Me’ to his seminal hit ‘My My My’. His productions and sound have certainly transcended the confines of Dance Music, influencing mainstream popular culture. With a list of collaborations spanning Dizzy Rascal to Steve Aoki, not forgetting one half of Duck Sauce with turntable wizard A-Trak, Armand Van Helden has a reputation as one of House Music’s finest producers.
 
On a roll already this year, Mark Knight has firmly cemented both himself and Toolroom back into the club with a string of collaborations in 2022, from ‘You Are A God’ with James Hurr and Cari Golden to ‘What I Need’ with RETNA, Mark seeks to continue this trend with ‘The Music Began To Play’. Kicking off with a hard-hitting, thumping House groove and electrified bass line that drives the record hard, pushing the mix to the absolute limit. Before dropping into the track’s golden moment, sampling the 1979 classic Disco cut ‘I Don’t Need No Music’ by T.J.M, a gem of a record and one that encapsulates both Mark and Armand’s love for classic cuts. Together, ‘The Music Began To Play’ is an instant classic in the making, masterful work from two of House Music’s finest showing us how it’s done.

Lyrics:
I got the call today, I didn't wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck,
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning again
I've been trying to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
And people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age
The trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness
They're the very things we kill, I guess
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us,
You know it doesn't keep me warm

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you, baby
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I figured out, I have to learn again
I've been trying to get down to the heart of the matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

There are people in your life who've come and gone
They let you down, you know they hurt your pride
You better put it all behind you, baby, 'cause life goes on
You keep carrying that anger, it'll eat you up inside, baby

I've been trying to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me

I've been trying to get down to the Heart of the Matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So I'm thinking about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me

Forgiveness
Forgiveness
(Baby)
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if you don't love me anymore
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Forgiveness

In 1981, six years after joining Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Nicks went solo for the first time with her debut album ‘Bella Donna’. A massive success, it sold more than five million copies in the U.S., topped the album charts and produced four hit singles, including her signature anthem, ""Edge Of Seventeen."" More platinum albums followed – ‘The Wild Heart’ (1983), ‘Rock A Little’ (1985), and ‘The Other Side Of The Mirror’ (1989).

In 2019, Stevie Nicks made history by becoming the first female artist inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice - first as a member of Fleetwood Mac in 1998, and most recently in recognition of an extraordinary solo career that spans nearly 40 years.",True,True,23706997.0,rock music

Carla Monroe - Still Sleepless (Official Lyric Video),Axtone,3042584.0,16658.0,306.0,"UK DJ/producer D.O.D welcomes rising star Carla Monroe to feature on one of the year’s standout tracks. The topline showcases her talents as both vocalist and writer, striking the perfect balance of creating something new whilst retaining the original’s magic.

The original ‘Sleepless’ has to date, racked up the best part of ten million streams, fifty thousand Shazams, over thirty Radio 1 plays and tastemaker support from the likes of Danny Howard, Annie Mac, Oliver Heldens & Diplo with the curation giant Selected uploading to their YouTube channel.

Carla Monroe first burst onto the scene in 2017 with the platinum hit single ‘17’ which she wrote and sung for MK and followed this up with another collab with the house legend on ‘2AM’. 
Subsequent cuts, collaborations and sessions have been with Grammy-nominated duo Camelphat, Nervo, R3HAB, Julia Michaels, Oliver Heldens, Riton, Meduza and Tiesto.
This year saw Carla release her debut single ‘Shapes’ which picked up radio playlist support from Capital Dance (featured as Jam Hot) and Kiss Dance.

Carla: ‘I always loved the original ‘Sleepless’ so when D.O.D and Laura Welsh hit me up asking if I wanted to help write to it, I jumped at the chance! I remember us trying out so many different ideas until we found the magic in a melody we had actually used in a different part of the song. We really wanted to stay true to the original version of ‘Sleepless’ and compliment what was already there without overcomplicating it. The song is about having second thoughts about a situation –something we can all relate to I think! I like writing about real-life stuff, so I hope this song resonates with others the way it does for me!’

D.O.D currently sits at #83 in the DJ Mag Top 100 with his dexterity behind the decks earning him the accolade of one of a handful of DJ's to record a brace of mixes for Pioneer. He makes regular appearances at festivals such as Tomorrowland, Creamfields with an extensive China tour set to be announced. 

This year has seen demand for D.O.D rise, with a slew of singles released on Armada and remixes for Atlantic and FFRR, the latter on Owen Westlake’s hit ‘So Much Love’.

D.O.D feat. Carla Monroe ‘Still Sleepless’ is released September 17th on Axtone Records.

Hot on the heels of unleashing his super-infectious remix of ARTY’s ‘Take Your Time’, D.O.D amplifies the momentum with a delicious new single. Speaking of grabbing someone tight and never letting go on a backdrop of warm piano chords and chunky bass grooves, ‘All Mine’ truly is a song to treasure.

Carla Monroe - Still Sleepless (Official Lyric Video),Axtone,3042584.0,16658.0,306.0,"UK DJ/producer D.O.D welcomes rising star Carla Monroe to feature on one of the year’s standout tracks. The topline showcases her talents as both vocalist and writer, striking the perfect balance of creating something new whilst retaining the original’s magic.

The original ‘Sleepless’ has to date, racked up the best part of ten million streams, fifty thousand Shazams, over thirty Radio 1 plays and tastemaker support from the likes of Danny Howard, Annie Mac, Oliver Heldens & Diplo with the curation giant Selected uploading to their YouTube channel.

Carla Monroe first burst onto the scene in 2017 with the platinum hit single ‘17’ which she wrote and sung for MK and followed this up with another collab with the house legend on ‘2AM’. 
Subsequent cuts, collaborations and sessions have been with Grammy-nominated duo Camelphat, Nervo, R3HAB, Julia Michaels, Oliver Heldens, Riton, Meduza and Tiesto.
This year saw Carla release her debut single ‘Shapes’ which picked up radio playlist support from Capital Dance (featured as Jam Hot) and Kiss Dance.

Carla: ‘I always loved the original ‘Sleepless’ so when D.O.D and Laura Welsh hit me up asking if I wanted to help write to it, I jumped at the chance! I remember us trying out so many different ideas until we found the magic in a melody we had actually used in a different part of the song. We really wanted to stay true to the original version of ‘Sleepless’ and compliment what was already there without overcomplicating it. The song is about having second thoughts about a situation –something we can all relate to I think! I like writing about real-life stuff, so I hope this song resonates with others the way it does for me!’

D.O.D currently sits at #83 in the DJ Mag Top 100 with his dexterity behind the decks earning him the accolade of one of a handful of DJ's to record a brace of mixes for Pioneer. He makes regular appearances at festivals such as Tomorrowland, Creamfields with an extensive China tour set to be announced. 

This year has seen demand for D.O.D rise, with a slew of singles released on Armada and remixes for Atlantic and FFRR, the latter on Owen Westlake’s hit ‘So Much Love’.

D.O.D feat. Carla Monroe ‘Still Sleepless’ is released September 17th on Axtone Records.

Something different from D.O.D, ‘Set Me Free’ expertly targets clubs and similar dance music environments. Flaunting a nostalgic ‘90s vibe and an infectious vocal hook amidst anthemic synth hits, chunky grooves and tenacious high strings, this track is just what the crowd needs to get lost in the music.

Lyrics:

Listen girl
Who do you think I am?
Don't you know that he was my man?
But I chose to let him go
So why do you act like
I still care about him?
Looking at me like I'm hurt
When I'm the one who said I didn't
want it to work
Don't you forget I had him first?

What are you thinking?
Do you know about us back then?
Do you know i dumped your husband,
girlfriend?
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me""",True,True,129975390.0,rhythm and blues

Lyrics:

A smoky room, a small cafe
They come to hear you play
And drink and dance the night away
I sit out in the crowd
And close my eyes
Dream you're mine
But you don't know
You don't even know that I am there

I wish that I was in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me through the night
'Till the dawn
I wish you'd hold me in your arms

Lyrics:

Since you been gone
I been hangin' around here lately
With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car tried to clear my mind
Didn't help me
I guess I'm all messed up now baby
Soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play
A song comes on the radio
And there U are baby once again

It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you",True,True,19918870.0,pop music

Lyrics:

Must have been heaven sent to me
Cause I never knew love like this
You know you make me feel
So good inside and boy,
It's a feeling I just can't hide
And baby words can't express my gratitude
For each and every little thing you do
I want to understand
You're all the man
That I love and I know
That I need and I want and more
Baby let me count the ways

How many ways, I love you
Let me count the ways
How many ways, I love you
Let me cont the ways",True,True,17742364.0,pop music

Lyrics:

Hey, hey hold up a minute
Let me stop up here and use this pay 
Phone real quick
Hey, hey Toni, it's me, I was just calling
You know
Just calling to let you know, don't
Wait up for me tonight
I mean I just got a lotta things on my
Mind I gotta think about, you know
Just umm, I'll be over Brian's house,
You know, just for tonight
I mean, I know things are different, but
You know
It's not you, it's me, you know, it's
really me, you know
I mean basically, I just think I'm gonna
need some space 

Just don't make no excuses, no no
Why you gotta lie to me
Just be a man about it
Baby, you don't gotta lie to me, no
Just be a man about it
If you wanna leave go on
Just be a man about it
Come and grab your things and go on
Right now
Just be a man about it

Lyrics:

If you could give me one good reason
Why I should believe you
Believe in all the things that you tell
I would sure like to believe you
My heart wants to receive you
Just make me know that you are sincere
You know I'd love for you to lead me
And follow thru completely
So won't you give me all I ask for
And if you give your very best
To bring me happiness
I'll show you just how much I adore you

Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters
Matters to me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby,
Baby, cause you mean so much
To me",True,True,10247208.0,pop music

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
A party we will throw
A party we will throw now

[Verse 1: The Game]
All I need is the chronic to keep me fit
A bad bitch, a project apartment and 2 pits
Red chucks, a red bic to keep my kush lit
Thank god for what I get but never really needed shit
I'm a hustler nigga, that's how I got this red Bentley
Slay the competition and told them that Dre sent me
Walk through the smoke like what up loc
Cause one always got that bomb dot com that make me choke
We gonna twist up 8 for Nate blow the smoke through the clouds
In hopes that it reaches the pearly gates
Now, how many niggas wanna throw up a dub
And be surrounded by the baddest bitches up in the club yeah
It's the math blood, sixes on the ave cuz
Phantom got your girl pussy wetter than my bath tub
Fuck her all night, wake her up at 6
Lil mama grab your shit, get ghost

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
A party we will throw
A party we will throw now

[Verse 2: Warren G]
Click clack what up, zig zag run up
Nic nac paddie whack, twisting up a fat sack
Tic tac toe up, I be in them streets like an intersection
I got connection, from every section
Critical, political, it's killer Cal'
Roll it up, now pass that shit around
My mental is cynical, original
Thinking you could see us
I'm like nigga how?
I'm in that diamond lane, I'm in that diamond chain
Glissing and glowing, I'm sipping liquor I'm blowing zippers my nigga I'm on one
I'm pushing the zone up, I'm sitting up, my pistol shining my chrome up
My nigga Game got the gun load
One shot mix a nigga brain like some gumbo, uh, oh
All that tough talk nigga, what for?
Shut your scary ass up at the front door

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
A party we will throw
A party we will throw now

[Warren G]
Couldn't nobody diss my nigga, damn I miss my nigga
Pour out a little liquor, big Nate Dogg nigga 213
From the city by the sea, where them G's ride
Turn around baby let me listen to the b-side
Slap that, tap that, after that, east side
As I travel this road I see the street sign
Ready for whatever, Beretta's you know I keep mine

[The Game]
It's the L-B, C-P-T nigga we be, OG to BG, that's where the weed be
Killer (what?) Cali-forni-a, eh
Load the strap, hop into the six trey Snoop, what up loc
I'm headed to the east side, G ride throwing up everything but the peace sign
Gold Daytonas, gangbang persona nigga trip, I'ma pop the top off his Corolla

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road

[Chorus- Warren G]
I want it all; money, fast cars
Diamond rings, gold chains and champagne
Shit, everydamn thing
I want it all; houses, expenses
My own business, a truck, hmm, and a couple o' Benz's
I want it all; brand new socks and draws
And I'm bawlin everytime I stop and talk to y'all
I want it all, all, all, all
I want it all, all, all, all, all

[Warren G]
They say, 'There go Warren G with that envious stare'
I love this game too much, I wish these haters wasn't here
It's a shame, we came too far to turn back
It's a cold world, it gets so hard, you learned that
Won't fall tryin' to walk from crawl
Tryin' to hustle up from broke to ballin'
And, yeah, y'all in effect that's all me
The jiggy G-Z, all my niggas that keep it real and do it easy
Believe me, young nigga, fat meat is greasy
And shit stink, so if you plan a lick and hit a bank
And get away, or get gaffled the very next day
Don't cry, hold your head up high
And remember what you told yourself nigga
I said remember what you told yourself nigga
I said remember what you told yourself nigga
I said remember what you told yourself nigga
Ha ha

[Chorus]

[Mack 10]
I want it all, so I got to wake up and ball
And thanks to y'all, I got plaques on the wall
Mack 10 laced with the know how to paper chase
Crushed ice, throw my Rollie face in the platinum fan base
From net workin' and hustlin', no doubt, I got slout
And live the lifestyle that Robin Leech talkin' about
Slow down, player, don't hate cuz you can't relate
The Bentley Coupes and kickin' gears on Harley's with the straights
I got more lime light than Vegas on cable
Willing enable to shoot, seen nervios at the craps table
And while you can't get off the ground, I'm getting high
Fuckin' fly and fly, with desire to build an empire
I strapped up and took flight like a missle
Told them loud and clear as a whistle 'Hoo Bangin' is official'
Handing out gold medallions at roll-call
I'ma ball and never fall cuz Mack 10 want it all

[Chorus]

[Warren G]
Me and 10 get paid escapade to the spot
We hots like rocks served on hot blocks
I notice money make the world circulate
So we gon' stack and stack and take a sip in ?Perkle Lake?
Bump, let the woofers sub (sub), show the homies love (love)
Warren to the G (G), and Little G-Dub (Dub)
Surface on the low, slide or don't slide at all
Ride or don't ride at all
Ha ha

[Mack 10]
Warren, I couldn't be more serious about my 'fetti
I stay tight on the mic and keep the pen movin' steady
I want it all, dawg, and it might be greed
I hate to trip, but I got two little mouths to feed
They don't know nuttin' about no excuses and disrespect
Or somebody bein' zig with they Daddy's royalty check
And at that point, I'm through talkin', dawg, enough said
So, if you owe Mack money, then I suggest you break bread

[Chorus]

[Warren G] [Mack 10]
Mack 10 What up? I know
The paper's out there, ha ha Yeah, Warren G
What up? You know
The paper's out there, ha ha Yeah
G Funk What up? You know
The paper's out there, ha ha That's right
What? Hoo Bangin' What up? We know
The paper's out there, ha ha That's right, what?
The whole world
Paper's out there Speak on it
Ha ha
All the hood
Paper's out there

LETRA
Eu não vou pro inferno
Eu não iria tão longe por você
Mas vai ser impossível não lembrar
Vou estar em tudo em que você vê

Nos seus livros, nos seus discos
Vou entrar na sua roupa
E onde você menos esperar
Eu vou estar

Eu não vou pro céu também
Eu não sou tão bom assim
E mesmo quando encontrar alguém
Você ainda vai ver a mim

Nos seus livros, nos seus discos
Vou entrar na sua roupa
E onde você menos esperar

Embaixo da cama
Nos carros passando
No verde da grama
Na chuva chegando
Eu vou voltar

Nos seus livros, nos seus discos
Vou entrar na sua roupa
E onde você menos esperar
Eu vou estar, eu vou estar

PAROLES :

C’était des haineux ils m’ont trahi j’suis trop peiné
J’suis dans la Ghini presque à 300 j’peux plus freiner
Le sang est marron j’ai bu trop d’Hennessy
Tu m’dis que le compte y est mais moi je vérifie

Et si y’a pas les comptes on peut t’enlever la vie 
T’enterrer dans un trou comme dans le Tennessee 
Ahah Oui comme dans le Tennessee 

Kichta kichta un peu partout j’en oublie dans le jean 
J’ai fondu pour la rue pour elle j’avais le cœur en cire
Ça mange des pierres quand c’est chaud alors des briques j’empile 
L’ancien m’a dit que ça ira mieux mais c’est de pire en pire 

Et comme je suis black comme ma CB je peux mourir dans le film 
Il me faut un bébé je fais les courses j’achète un P38 
Il me faut la paix du cœur on a grandi dans le Dîn
On en a fait de la pierre elle revient des Antilles 

Ehhh j’suis solo dans la mêlée
Ils me haïront autant qu’ils m’ont Aime
Haaa autant qu’ils m’ont aimé
Ils m’ont condamné j’n’ai pas pu plaider fils

Solo dans la mêlée
Ils me haïront autant qu’ils m’ont aimé
Haaa autant qu’ils m’ont aimé
Beaucoup trop de chefs d’inculpation 
Tema le CV fils 

C’était des haineux ils m’ont trahi j’suis trop peiné
J’suis dans la Ghini presque à 300 j’peux plus Freiner
Le sang est marron j’ai bu trop d’Hennessy
Tu m’dis que le compte y est mais moi je vérifie

Et si y’a pas les comptes on peut t’enlever la vie 
T’enterrer dans un trou comme dans le Tennessee 
Oui comme dans le Tennessee 

J’rêvais d’ouverture papillon
Encaisse 2-3 millions
Maman n’avait pas le filon
Donc j’ai plongé dans le pilon
Ocean plein de lions
Fort de France cite Dillon
Et j’ai pris appris que le crime n’est pas ce qu’il est avant qu’on l’fasse
J’ai pris toute ma peine sur moi j’l’ai enterré dans le sable

On a quitté la school 
Pour faire des pesos grave 
Faut que je nettoie mon Glock ensuite mes Air Force 1 
J’arrive toujours à l’heure quand c’est pour des choses graves 
On a pris de la bouteille quelques kilos de Coca 
C’est trop grave 
Pre chorus 2 
Kalash 
Mes rêves sont devenus cauchemars
Leur loyauté sur le trottoir
J’me suis levé tôt mais c’était tard

C’était des haineux ils m’ont trahi j’suis trop peiné
J’suis dans la Ghini presque à 300 j’peux plus Freiner
Le sang est marron j’ai bu trop d’Hennessy
Tu m’dis que le compte y est mais moi je vérifie

Et si y’a pas les comptes on peut t’enlever la vie 
T’enterrer dans un trou comme dans le Tennessee 
Oui comme dans le Tennessee

Ahah Gangsta dans ma jeunesse 
Méduse un peu partout je fais la vedette 
Ahah Gangsta dans ma jeunesse

TOMBOLO
 
Pou premyé fwa
Pour la première fois
 
Mwen jwen an van foli ki bwinin mwen
J’ai été pris d’un vent de folie
 
An nouvo symphonie an didan mwen
Une nouvelle symphonie au fond de moi
 
Avan wou sa pa té janmin fet
Ça n’était jamais arrivé avant toi
 
Ou we mwen
Tu m’as vu
 
Ou we
Ou we
Tu as vu
 
Sa pinssonn pa té pe wè
Ce que personne ne pouvait voir
 
Ou pa te lé wè
Ou ne voulait voir
 
Ou we
Tu as vu
 
Adan fon nwessè esaye ridresé mwen
Dans l’obscurité tu as essayé de me
redresser
 
Ou we
Ou we
Mwen travesé Tombolo
Tu m’as vu traverser le Tombolo
An gwo lanmè
En haute mer
An gwo Lanmè
En haute mer
 
Mwen té ka kouché san domi
Je me couchais sans dormir
 
É leve san lenvi
Et me levais sans envie
 
Kon zetoil pedi an mi tan linfini
Comme une étoile perdue au millieu de l’infini
 
An la vi sans deliss an manjé sans zepissss
Une vie sans délice, un repas sans épices
 
Alle fe la fet te sipliss
Aller faire la fête était devenu un Suplice
 
Mwen té fou kon foumi
J’étais fou comme une fourmi
 
Kon Remi san fanmi an pli lorage, an pli lorage
Comme Rémi sans Famille en plein orage, en plein orage
 
Mwen té ja press oublyé
J’avais presque oublié
 
Ke lanmou pe fe briyé
Que l’amour pourrait faire briller
 
Tout nwessè
L’obscurité
 
Oh Gal.
 
Ou we mwen domi an Bando
Tu m’as vu dormir dans un Bando
 
San tele et san nintendo
Sans Télé sans Nintendo
 
Pa an lanmin pa an ve dlo
Ils ne m’ont ni tendu la main ni offert un verre d’eau
 
Yo pa té lé we mwen enlo
Ils n’avaient pas trop envie de me voir
 
A lhe la mwen ka boss up yo lé fe come back
Maintenant que je suis au top ils veulent revenir
 
Vyé kanmarad biswen ripwan contact
D’anciens amis veulent renouer contact
 
Di mwen fo pa yo attan an ack
Mieux vaut qu’ils n’attendent rien de moi
 
Lhe yo té lesse mwen tombe an krak
Après qu’ils m’aient laissé tomber
 
Ou we
Oh we…..
 
Sa pinssonn pa té pe wè
Ce que personne ne pouvait voir
Ou pa te lé wè

[LETRA]

QUIZÁS NO FUE COINCIDENCIA ENCONTRARME CONTIGO DE NUEVO
YO QUISIERA SOLO POR ESTA VEZ ROBARTE CON UNA MIRADA UN BESO QUE TE LLEVE AL ALMA Y QUE EL MUNDO SUPIERA LO QUE HAY ENTRE TÚ Y YO
ME ESTÁ MATANDO ESTE SILENCIO, POR FAVOR

Y ES QUE TE SIGO PENSANDO CADA VEZ IMAGINANDO
CUANDO LA PASAS CONMIGO
SE QUE TÚ SIENTES HOY LO MISMO
Y ES QUE TE SIGO EXTRAÑANDO, YO NO SE NI COMO NI CUANDO
ME HE VUELTO LOCO POR TI
DIME QUE LE HAGO SI ESTE CORANZONCITO TE HA ELEGIDO A TI

TE SIGO PENSANDO SIEMPRE IMAGINANDO

YO NO TE PROMETO ENAMORARTE, ANTES DE CONQUISTARTE
VAMOS PASITO A PASO NO HAY POR QUÉ PRECIPITARSE
LLEVO TREINTA VERANOS EN EL EQUIPAJE
PARA QUE LA SEÑORITA NO SE ESTRESE Y SE RELAJE

LE TIRO UN WHATSAPP Y A MÍ ÉL NO ME CONTESTA SE CREE ÉL QUE NO QUIERE PERO LUEGO SE INTERESA QUE SEAMOS AMIGOS
YO SÉ QUE SIENTES LO MISMO

Y ES QUE TE SIGO PENSANDO CADA VEZ IMAGINANDO
CUANDO LA PASAS CONMIGO
SE QUE TÚ SIENTES HOY LO MISMO
Y ES QUE TE SIGO EXTRAÑANDO, YO NO SE NI COMO NI CUANDO
ME HE VUELTO LOCO POR TI
DIME QUE LE HAGO SI ESTE CORANZONCITO TE HA ELEGIDO A TI
DIME QUE LE HAGO
DIME QUE LE HAGO AY AY AY
AY A MI CORAZONCITO
QUIZÁS NO FUE COINCIDENCIA, CARLOS, Y ES QUE YO SIGO PENSANDO SI CONOCERTE FUE EL DESTINO PARA MI
DIME AHORA QUE ES LO QUE VAS A HACER
YO NO QUISIERA NADA A MEDIAS, O SOY TU REINA O NO ME VES

NO ME DIGAS COMO FUE, NI TAMPOCO PARA QUÉ ,LO QUE IMPORTA AHORA
ES QUE TU ESTÁS TAN SOLA, AHORA SACATE ESE CLAVO
DILE QUE TU ESTAS CONMIGO , QUE YO SOY TU ESCLAVO Y QUE NO SOY TU AMIGO

Y ES QUE TE SIGO PENSANDO CADA VEZ IMAGINANDO
CUANDO LA PASAS CONMIGO
YO NO QUISIERA NADA A MEDIAS, O SOY TU REINA O NO ME VES
SE QUE TÚ SIENTES HOY LO MISMO
Y ES QUE TE SIGO EXTRAÑANDO, YO NO SE NI COMO NI CUANDO
ME HE VUELTO LOCO POR TI
DIME QUE LE HAGO SI ESTE CORANZONCITO TE HA ELEGIDO A TI

Y ES QUE TE SIGO PENSANDO CADA VEZ IMAGINANDO
CUANDO LA PASAS CONMIGO
SE QUE TÚ SIENTES HOY LO MISMO
Y ES QUE TE SIGO EXTRAÑANDO, YO NO SE NI COMO NI CUANDO

Lyrics Que No, Que No:
 
Llevo un tiempo que no descanso,
que como poco, cuesta sonreír…
He pasado por el aro
y he hecho cosas que no me hacen feliz.

Tengo la bandeja llena de peticiones,
de mil favores, 
y absolutamente nadie pregunta por mí.

Lo pienso y me enciendo un incienso,
y despliego todo el arsenal de velas.
Me paro, respiro, sonrío, me fío,
descorcho una botella.

Si elijo ser mi prioridad 
no es cuestión de egoísmo.
El tiempo de calidad
parte dedicado a uno mismo.

Y si no me sale del corazón,
voy a aprender a decir que no.
Quien bien me quiere lo va a comprender,
yo no nací solo pa`complacer.
Y si no me sale del corazón,
voy a aprender a decir que no.
Si quiero mejorar el mundo,
primero voy a mimarme yo.
(Que no, que no…).

Me he vestido con ropa a la moda,
me he puesto muy mona
pa´gustarme a mí.
He comprado un ramito de rosas
y, nerviosa, me he pedido salir.

Tengo la cabeza llena de mil razones
que me aseguran que el amor más verdadero
está más cerca de lo que creo.

Ay, qué tontería, María, 
si te quedas sola pa´toda la vida,
Vistiendo los santos
con cientos de gatos,
llorando sin compañía.

Si elijo ser mi prioridad 
no es cuestión de egoísmo.
El tiempo de calidad
parte dedicado a uno mismo.

Y si no me sale del corazón,
voy a aprender a decir que no.
Quien bien me quiere lo va a comprender,
yo no nací solo pa`complacer.
Y si no me sale del corazón,
voy a aprender a decir que no.
Si quiero mejorar el mundo,
primero voy a mimarme yo.

Yo no necesito prenda' pa' brillar (Ja)
Muchas puya' y no se atreven a tirar
Pero PR e' chiquito y siempre te van a pillar
Cabrón, 'toy crecío' (Ey, ey), eh-eh
Me hice millonario, ahora tengo lo mío' (Me hice millonario), eh-eh
Respeta'o en lo' barrio' y en lo' caserío' (To' el mundo me quiere), eh-eh
Tu envidia no me afecta, yo estoy bendecido (Yao)
Pero si te pillamo' dormío', prra (Let's go, Austin)

Esto e' Puerto Rico, lugar de respeto, y se escribe con R, R (PR)
Ya son 15 año' rompiendo culito' con R (Au)
Que vivan los guerreros en el Barrio Obrero (Yah)
Donde hay callejones, cientos de crackeros
Llegaron los kilos desde el extranjero (Ah, ah)
Ya se acabó el polvo pa' los periqueros (Uy)
Adoro mi barrio con sus personajes (Yah)
Par de prostituta', maleantes salvajes (Ah)
Cambiamos los Honda, ahora son Panameras (Wow, yah)
Vengo de una villa que tiene palmeras (Yah)
Yo soy la máxima expresión en el callejón (Ajá)
Y mi lealtad, eso nunca se aquebranta (No)
Mi voz pesa desde niño en este callejón (Yah)
A ti solo te la damo' por tu garganta (Ah, lambón)
Tú habla' mucha mierda, pero tú no hace' na' de lo que dice', dice'
Pregúntale a tu gángster favorito y te dirán que si lo dije fue porque lo hice

[Coro: Bad Bunny & Kendo Kaponi]
Yo soy de P fucking R (P fucking R)

Yo soy de Puerto Rico (Yo soy de PR)
Me investigan como narcotraficante porque música trafico (Ah, ¡ah!)

LETRA: 

Dicen que soy un delincuente, por ahí la gente es lo que habla
Por mí que hablen, que comenten, porque a nadie le debo nada
Gracias a Dios le doy porque él me trajo hasta aquí 
No me dejó solo y me di cuenta quién está pa' mí 
Dicen que soy un delincuente (Blup, blup), por ahí la gente es lo que habla 
Por mí que hablen, que comenten, porque a nadie le debo nada 
Gracias a Dios le doy porque él me trajo hasta aquí 
No me dejó solo y me di cuenta quién está pa' mí 

Diablo, que cherreo (¿Ah?)
Cogí dinero y me bajaron el de'o (Jaja)
Ya no era el rey del trapeo
Ahora soy un diablo y la prensa me quiere ver preso
Y hablan mierda 'e mí, pero no hablan del congreso (Jaja)
Dicen que soy un delincuente, el rifle siempre en mi casa (Uah)
Tantos cabrones que me odian y que siempre me amenazan (No)
Y no me vo' a dejar matar y voy a ver a mi hijo crecer (-er)
Y también me necesita mi mujer (-jer)
Mi mai' no para de llorar, sé que fallé (Uah)
Porque yo era su ángel y me convertí en Lucifer
Y me superé
Me cancelaron el Choli, en la prisión me quieren ver
Me juzgaron por mi' letra' y me metieron el pie
Pero cincuenta millone', gira mundial ya coroné, uah
¿Y qué me van a hacer?, uah
'Toy borracho de poder, uah
Dicen: ""¿Quién este se cree?"", uah
Hijueputa, soy Anuel, uah

Dicen que soy un delincuente (Eh-eh), por ahí la gente es lo que habla 
Por mí que hablen, que comenten, porque a nadie le debo nada 
Gracias a Dios le doy porque él me trajo hasta aquí
No me dejó solo y me di cuenta quién está pa' mí 

Llegó un chárter privado a la pista 'e aterrizaje
Desembarca individuo, conocido personaje
Un can del TSA se sienta y marca el equipaje
Y oficiale' de aduana preguntan que cuánto en efectivo traje 
Disculpe oficial, no recuerdo cantida' exacta
Vengo cansa'o del viaje, un mal rato no me hace falta
Si e' má' de lo debido, pues se reporta y se informa
Llené mal el papel, disculpa, no leí las norma' 
No hay nada que esconder, yo ando totalmente legal
Jefe, yo soy cantante, yo vengo de trabajar
Confísquenlo si quieren, con él se pueden quedar
Pero no venga a arrestarme porque se quieren pautar

Se lucraron, curaron, de mí mierda hablaron y yo, calla'o me quedé 
Difamaron, juzgaron, hasta me trancaron, pero, allá arriba hay un jue' 
Que todo lo ve, y yo confío en él 
Tratan de meterme el pie, pero no van a poder 

Y aunque digan que soy 
Un bandolero donde voy 
Le doy gracia' a Dio' 
Por hoy estar donde estoy 
Y vo' a seguir con mi tumbao' 
Y mis ojo' colora'o 
Con los mío' activa'o 
Ustede' to' me lo han da'o 

Dicen que soy un delincuente, por ahí la gente es lo que habla
Por mí que hablen, que comenten, porque a nadie le debo nada
Gracias a Dios le doy porque él me trajo hasta aquí 
No me dejó solo y me di cuenta quién está pa' mí 
Dicen que soy un delincuente
Por mí que hablen, que comenten, porque a nadie le debo nada 
Gracias a Dios le doy porque él me trajo hasta aquí 
No me dejó solo y me di cuenta quién está pa' mí

Letra/Lyrics:

KENDO
Burberry, Fendi, se prende el amor
Rojo, sangre, el aventador
A gorilla glue huele el interior
Y la medusa se enculebra en la 22

ANUEL
Richard Miller, en mi mano de cazador
La pinta completa de Christian Dior
Esta noche no quiero un error
Hacemos una porno y yo voy a ser el director

KENDO
Contigo no me pongo necio
Baby ese toto lo aprecio
Porque tú tienes valor
Pero muchas solo tienen precio

ANUEL
Se te humedeció…cuando te toqué baby
Don don don don don
Contigo puedo ser fiel
Tú estas en otro nivel
Baby don don don don don

DADDY YANKEE
Te llevo conmigo a viajar en el jet
Mi aerolínea tú la tienes de UBER
Eso está temblando cómo San Andrés WO!
Ojitos verdes como moña de Vancouver
Dale ma oh!
Sigo pasando por el GO
Batman en el Murciélago
Tengo las pacas TOA ALTA
Ellos las tienen TOA BAJA
Date un shot de tequila te está invitando el Patrón
Si quieres jugar con Jordan ven y caile
Te voy a dar el último baile
Hay fuego en el 23
Las botellas toa’ llegan via express
Y síguelo no le bajamos
A este nivel donde estamos
Si mueves el bote ma’ te lo anclamos
Nadie nos quita el sueño por eso roncamos

ANUEL
Se te humedeció…cuando te toqué baby
Don don don don don
Contigo puedo ser fiel
Tú estas en otro nivel,
Baby don don don don don

KENDO
El amor no se nos cae
Cómo la tarjeta que no da decline
20,000 en la Montclair y pedales Off-White
Los Benjamin soy el Dios del rap
El odin, yo no uso Louis Vuitton si no es con la Supreme

ANUEL
Se te mojaron los labios
Los de la boca y los de abajo
Mami te quiero ver estoy en Ibiza bebe
Yo te viajo

KENDO
Solo disfruta de la vista
Que voy a llevarte pa broncearte las playas nudistas
Pa' que nos tiren fotos imprevistas
Y nos vamos viral en portadas de revistas

DADDY YANKEE
Se te humedeció…cuando te toqué baby
Don don don don don
Contigo puedo ser fiel
Tú estas en otro nivel,
Baby don don don don don

ANUEL
El Lambo rojo como hell boy
Amarillo bumble bee el Rolls Royce
Los AKA y R en mi convoy
Y la baby es rubia Marylin Monroe

Baby yo te rompo la tanga
Real Hasta La muerte Mi ganga
De Kylie Jenner el maquillaje
Y la crema Versace pa' los masaje

Champaña y sexo, ye
Marijuana
El momento es perfecto
Para perdernos y matar las ganas

Champaña y sexo, ye
Marijuana
El momento es perfecto
Para perdernos y matar las ganas

KENDO
Se te humedeció…cuando te toqué baby
Don don don don don
Contigo puedo ser fiel
Tú estas en otro nivel,
Baby don don don don don

Lyrics / Letra

Yo solo quiero comerte
Como lo hice la primera ve'
Yo solo quiero tocarte
Pa' hablarte claro, yo te quiero romper
Tú y yo solo' en ropa interio-o-or
Sabiendo que yo te di calo-o-or, -or
Te calenté como el sol
No me hable' de amor que

Yo solo quiero comerte
Como lo hice la primera vez
Yo solo quiero tocarte
Pa' hablarte claro, yo te quiero romper (-per)
Tú y yo solo' en ropa interio-o-or
Sabiendo que yo te di calo-o-or, -or (-or)
Te calenté como el sol (Sol)
No me hables de amor que (ya sabe', babe)

Yo no 'toy pa' eso y tú tampoco
La noche e' joven, vámono' a lo loco
Dentro del carro te prendo como si fuera' un foco
Tú ere' mi Torre Sabana y yo soy tu Coco
Lo' interiore' son cuero, baby, pero tú ere fina
Flow de Guaynabo y la actitu' de Carolina
La' uña' con to' le combinan
Baby, yo tenía hambre y tú que te metiste a la cocina
Vi el menú y solo a ti quiero comerte
En ropa interior de nuevo quiero verte
Marca tu ubicación y dale comparte
I wanna fuck you, baby, yo quiero darte
A sola', le dije ""Hola""
En tu cancha, baby, dejé la bola
Encima de tu cuerpo destapó la Champola
Si tú eres mi gatita, menéame la cola

Pa' yo entonces comerte
Como lo hice la primera ve'
Yo solo quiero tocarte
Pa' hablarte claro, yo te quiero romper
Tú y yo solo' en ropa interio-o-or
Sabiendo que yo te di calo-o-or, -or
Te calenté como el sol
No me hable' de amor que

Yo solo quiero comerte
Como lo hice la primera vez
Yo solo quiero tocarte
Pa' hablarte claro, yo te quiero romper (-per)
Tú y yo solo' en ropa interio-o-or
Sabiendo que yo te di calo-o-or, -or (-or)
Te calenté como el sol (Sol)
No me hables de amor que

Tú y yo somo' una película y no paramo' 'e verno'
Yo soy un diablo y ese culo e' mi infierno
Dile a tu gato que hubo cambio de gobierno
Y yo soy tu demonio, pero a él le salieron cuerno'
Y tú quieres salir, pero yo te quiero en calma
Mami, tú ere' un problema y yo no creo en arreglar
Tú siempre de rodilla' y mi bicho e' el altar
Y si chingar alarga vida, yo te vo'a hacer inmortal
Como un peine dentro de ti vo'a vaciarme
Yo puedo darte, pero nunca involucrarme
Lo' otro' día' mirando el Aventador
Dije ""Mi vida 'tá cabrona, puedo morir en cruise control""

Yo solo quiero comerte
Como lo hice la primera ve'
Yo solo quiero tocarte, eh-eh
Pa' hablarte claro, yo te quiero romper
Tú y yo solo' en ropa interio-o-or
Sabiendo que yo te di calo-o-or, -or
Te calenté como el sol
No me hable' de amor que

Yo solo quiero comerte
Como lo hice la primera vez
Yo solo quiero tocarte
Pa' hablarte claro, yo te quiero romper (-per)
Tú y yo solo' en ropa interio-o-or
Sabiendo que yo te di calo-o-or, -or (-or)
Te calenté como el sol (sol)
No me hables de amor que (¡ah!)

Atiende lo que te voy a decir
La Presión
Lo' único' do' compositore'
A lo' que ustede' nunca van a poder superar
¿Me sigue' o no me sigue' todavía?
Pa' roncarme a mí o a nosotro'
A nosotro'
Tiene que chequear su expediente
Que nunca hayan capeao' letra' mía'
Ni del pana, jaja
¡Ah!
Oye, ¿me sigue' o no me sigue' todavía?
Timelezz
Esto e' Timelezz
Kendo Kaponi
Fino Como El Haze

Letra:

Pacho El Antifeka x Kendo Kaponi

Te causaron una herida
Y dice que es de por vida, eh
Los buenos momentos se recuerdan
Pero los malos no se olvidan, eh…

Quiere una noche divertida
Fuma y se pone atrevida
Antes estaba deprimida
Ahora no hay nada que le impida 

Hoy anda solita
Y sola es mejor
Dice que lo hace por su paz interior
Baby, estas bien rica desde superior
Pégate pa' oler tú perfume Christian Dior
Eh…

Yo quiero conocer tu ropa interior
Ya que yo se lo que hay en el interior
Yo no soy aquel, no soy el anterior

Hoy anda solita
Y sola es mejor
Dice que lo hace por su paz interior
Baby, estas bien rica desde superior
Pégate pa' oler tú perfume Christian Dior
Eh…

Yo quiero conocer tu ropa interior
Ya que yo se lo que hay en el interior
Yo no soy aquel, no soy el anterior

Hola baby, hola
Te traicionaron y andas sola,
Eres vegana y de ganas nadie te gana
Ahora que ninguno en tú cancha te deje la bola
A ese ángel se le ven las aureolas, si
No le gusta el color de las uñas y usa Shellac
Su cartera es Valentino cómo mi mochila
Está bebiendo alcohol detrás tiene la fila
Mucho odió pal' amor porque la mutila
Y yo voy hacer ese gol
En Miami vive Kendo 
Baby, la ciudad del sol
Con la Bred negra y roja en charol
Le da vista en Brickell parece un resort
Soy producto de la calle como fentanol

El de las jersey olímpica
Los dejo en la mamona,
Como la hierba Indica
Habla, dime indica
La barras de ustedes son hándicap,
Y pa’ a ese culo baby, dobletap

Hoy anda solita
Y sola e’ mejor
Dice que lo hace por su paz interior
Baby, estas bien rica desde superior
Pégate pa' oler tú perfume Christian Dior
Eh…

Yo quiero conocer tu ropa interior
Ya que yo se lo que hay en el interior
Yo no soy aquel, no soy el anterior

Y salió con escote
Con malas intenciones 
Aunque se le note, eh
Y yo que estoy a fuegote
Se ganó conmigo obliga’o le gasto el pote

El otro tipo la dañó por siempre 
No quiere saber de Febreros ni Diciembre
Ella no quiere a nadie 
Que le esté hablando de amor
Ella lo que quiere un tipo que la siembre
Cómo se supone
Y ella se pone
Fácil con cojones, Yeah, yeah
Baila to’as la canciones
Hip-Hop y Reggaetones
Olvidando la presiones, Yeah, yeah

En su cartera lipstic
Celu y condones
Dice que anda ready
Pa' toa's la situaciones
Le trajeron pasto
Tiene conexiones
La noche es de ella
Ciento un porciento 
De ilusiones

Hoy anda solita
Y sola e’ mejor
Dice que lo hace por su paz interior
Baby, estas bien rica desde superior
Pégate pa' oler tú perfume Christian Dior
Eh…

Yo quiero conocer tu ropa interior
Ya que yo se lo que hay en el interior
Yo no soy aquel, no soy el anterior

La que los fanáticos querían,

El rosado es lo oro
De estás prendas en mi piel
Yo lo he tenido todo
Esta fama es infiel
Con ella reí,
Con ella llore, 
Pero logré,
Lo que a mi viejita yo le juré
Que yo iba a ser grande,
Pero, baby ande con quién ande
No te ablande
Sueña, pero sueña en grande

Quédate solita 
Que sola es mejor
Cuenta conmigo si tiene temor
Baby, estás bien rica…
Baby, estás bien rica…

Si tú baby juega a perderte mami
Déjalo ganar Oí’te 
Y siempre quédate así conmigo
JA JA JA…
Ni tan lejos, que me muero
Pacho El Antifeka
Ni tan cerca, que me matas
Yomo Pauta
Mera Dime Pa!
Jetty
El Duro
Baby Johnny
Felixiano West...

#TuEresLaReina #DiomedesDiaz #Vallenato


Letra:

Pueden haber más bellas que tú
Habrá otra con más honor que tú
Pueden existir en este mundo, pero eres la reina
Las hay con coronas de cristal

Y tienen todas las perlas del mar
Tal ves pero en mi corazón tú eres la reina
Una reina sin tesoros ni tierras
Que me enseñó la manera de vivir, nada más

A estas horas de mi vida lamento
Haber gastado mi tiempo en cosas que no están
Quiero que nunca olvides cuánto este hombre te quiere
Y que deseo que algún día me cierres los ojos por mí

Sola me acompañaste en tantas luchas que tuve
Y hoy que he ganado en casi todas, no dudes, seguirás en mí
Trata de ser un momento conmigo feliz
Sólo se tiene la dicha un instante, no más

Y todavía no falta quien me la llame
Que si es traviesa mi reina coqueta
Siendo que con esos ojos del valle
Todos saben que yo no quiero fiesta

Siendo que con esos ojos del valle
Todos saben que yo no quiero fiesta
Pueden haber más nobles que tú
Habrá otra con más poder que tú

Pueden existir en esta vida, pero eres la reina
Tú no pides nada por tu amor
Tú no quieres nada por tu amor
Y aunque en tu castillo nada tengas, tú eres la reina

Una reina sin tesoros, ni tierras
Que me enseñó la manera de vivir nada más
A estas horas de mi vida lamento
Haber gastado mi tiempo en cosas que no están

Quiero que nunca olvides cuánto este hombre te quiere
Y que deseo que algún día me cierres los ojos por mí
Sola me acompañaste en tantas luchas que tuve
Y hoy que he ganado en casi todas, no dudes, seguirás en mí

Trata de ser un momento conmigo feliz
Sólo se tiene la dicha un instante no más
Y todavía no falta quien me la llame
Que si es traviesa mi reina coqueta

Siendo que con esos ojos del valle
Todos saben que yo no quiero fiesta
Siendo que con esos ojos del valle
Todos saben que yo no quiero fiesta

Que vieron con Santiago pasar
Que me vieron en San Juan con Diomedes
Que vieron con Santiago pasar
Y después cogimos pa' Carrizal

Trata de ser un momento conmigo feliz
Sólo se tiene la dicha un instante, no más
Y todavía no falta quien me la llame
Que si es traviesa mi reina coqueta

Siendo que con esos ojos del valle
Todos saben que yo no quiero fiesta
Siendo que con esos ojos del valle
Todos saben que yo no quiero fiesta

#SinMedirDistancias #DiomedesDiaz #Vallenato


Letra:

La herida que siempre llevo en el alma no cicatriza
Inevitable me marca la pena que es infinita
Quisiera volar bien lejos, muy lejos sin rumbo fijo
Buscar un lugar del mundo sin odio, vivir tranquilo

Eliminar las tristezas, las mentiras y las traiciones
No importa que nunca encuentre el corazón
Lo que ha buscado de verdad
No importa el tiempo que ya es muy corto
En las ansias largas de vivir
Cualquier minuto de placer
Será sentido en realidad
Si lleno el alma, si lleno el alma de eternidad
Si lleno el alma, si lleno el alma de eternidad

Es muy triste recordar momentos felices
De un cariño que sangró mi corazón
Llegó la hora de partir sin medir distancias
Y ni sombra quedará de aquel amor
Y ni sombra quedará de aquel amor

No quiero volver a verla más nunca por mi camino
Distancia que nos separa, me hiere su cruel olvido
Es muy cierto que la noche es tan larga con mi desvelo
Rayito de la mañana, tú sabes cuánto la quiero

Solitario en el recuerdo
Se va alejando mi queja
Amigos que me conocen me dirán
Qué es lo que pasa en tu interior

No eres el mismo que conocimos
Lleno de vida y de ilusión
Se nota a leguas de verdad
Que te lastima el corazón

Se nota a leguas que estás sufriendo
Por un amor
Se nota a leguas que estás sufriendo
Por un amor

Es muy triste recordar momentos felices
De un cariño que sangró mi corazón
Llegó la hora de partir sin medir distancias
Y ni sombra quedará de aquel amor
Y ni sombra quedará de aquel amor
Y ni sombra quedará de aquel amor

#AmarteMásNoPude #DiomedesDíaz #Vallenato 


Letra:
Para qué me quieres culpar
Si tú eras para mí como agua pal sediento
Acaso no recuerdas ya que me sentí morir
Sin la miel de tus besos

Pero una vez te vi partir
No lo pude evitar
Me quedé en el intento
Dejaste de regar el jardín
Y en él no quedan ya sino pétalos muertos

Y entonces para qué decir
Que no te amaba si no es cierto
Entonces para qué decir
Que no te amaba si no es cierto

Decir que no te amaba sería negar mis canciones
Y que Freddy Molina nunca le cantó a su tierra

Que la cumbia y el porro no son el sentir más noble
De todos los troveros de la región sabanera
Y me forgé contigo todo un mundo de ilusiones
Hasta sentí llevarte como la sangre en mis venas

Pero un día te marchaste de mi tierra
Sin decirme porque ni para donde
Pero un día te marchaste de mi tierra
Sin decirme porque ni para donde

Te quise con el alma, bien sabes
Que amarte más no pude, volaste
Con rumbo hacia las nubes, más altas
Ya no pude alcanzarte

Hoy cuando de la nube te bajas
Es demasiado tarde, que vaina
Pues ya no queda nada, de aquel amor tan grande
Pues ya no queda nada, de aquel amor tan grande

Quien pudo amarnos más que Dios
Si fue quien nos creó un día a su semejanza
El mismo que en la cruz murió por nuestra salvación
Uno como si nada

De igual manera sufrí yo la ausencia de su amor
Mientras tanto volabas
Sin importarte mi dolor, ahí estuvo tu error
Entonces qué reclamas

Y hoy vienes buscando perdón
Porque un viento quebró tus alas
Y hoy vienes buscando perdón
Porque un viento quebró tus alas

Yo puedo perdonarte si es que estás arrepentida
Pero volver contigo no lo puedo hacer ni en sueños

Recuerda que te di la mejor parte de mi vida
Buscando ser feliz pero fallé en mi noble empeño
Porque mis sentimientos los dejaste por el suelo
Como algo que no sirve y que en cualquier parte se tira

Y si en algo te sirve de consuelo
Le pediré a mi Dios, que te bendiga
Y si en algo te sirve de consuelo
Le pediré a mi Dios, que te bendiga

Te quise con el alma, bien sabes
Que amarte más no pude, volaste
Con rumbo hacia las nubes, más altas
Ya no pude alcanzarte

Hoy cuando de la nube te bajas
Es demasiado tarde, que vaina
Pues ya no queda nada, de aquel amor tan grande
Pues ya no queda nada, de aquel amor tan grande
Pues ya no queda nada, de aquel amor tan grande

#LaPlata #DiomedesDíaz #Vallenato 


Letra:
Si la vida fuera estable todo el tiempo
Yo no bebería ni malgastaría la plata 
Si la vida fuera estable todo el tiempo
Yo no bebería ni malgastaría la plata  

Pero me doy cuenta que la vida es un sueño
y antes de morir es mejor aprovecharla 
Pero me doy cuenta que la vida es un sueño
y antes de morir es mejor aprovecharla 
 
Por eso la plata que cae en mis manos
La gasto en mujeres bebida y bailando
Por eso la plata que cae en mis manos
La gasto en mujeres bebida y bailando  
 
Todo el mundo pelea si dejo una herencia
si guardo un tesoro o lo gozo yo

Se apodera el diablo de aquella riqueza
Entonces no voy a la gloria de Dios 
Se apodera el diablo de aquella riqueza
Entonces no voy a la gloria de Dios  

Se acaba la vida de este cuerpo humano
Y lo que e guardado no se pa quien es 
Se acaba la vida de este cuerpo humano
Y lo que e guardado no se pa quien es 

En el cementerio estoy vuelto gusano
Y allá están peliando lo que yo deje 
En el cementerio estoy vuelto gusano
Y allá están peliando lo que yo deje 

Por eso la plata que cae en mis manos
La gasto en mujeres, bebida y bailando 
Por eso la plata que cae en mis manos
La gasto en mujeres, bebida y bailando 

Todo el mundo pelea si dejo una herencia
si guardo un tesoro o lo gozo yo

Se apodera el diablo de aquella riqueza
entonces no voy a la gloria de Dios 
Se apodera el diablo de aquella riqueza
entonces no voy a la gloria de Dios 

Por eso la plata que cae en mis manos
La gasto en mujeres bebida y bailando 
Por eso la plata que cae en mis manos
La gasto en mujeres bebida y bailando

#DiomedesDíaz #MiPrimeraCana #Vallenato


Letra:

Una hebra de cabello adorna mi cuerpo
Una hebra de cabello adorna mi alma
Ay ve, mi primera cana
Noticias de mi vejez
Yo se que Rafael Santos cuando me vea

Lleno de juventud le dice a la mama
Ay, ve papa tiene canas
No se si ella se lo crea
Ay adiós, se va mi juventud
Y ahora ya no la vuelvo a ver

Se va llena de gratitud
Y me deja solo con mi vejez
Se va llena de gratitud
Y me deja solo con mi vejez
Un montón de mujeres se me llevaron

Lo mejor de mi vida sentimental
Y hay unas que me pagaron mal
Y otras que muy bien se portaron
La vida me ha golpeado mas de dos veces
Pero yo he sido un hombre muy optimista
Ay ve, gracias Virgen del Carmen

Por darme tantas cosas bonitas
Por ejemplo, me diste una mujer
Que ha sido como la madre mía,
De Luis Angel, de Santos Rafael
De Diomedes, y el gran Martín Elías
De Luis Angel, de Santos Rafael
De Diomedes, y el gran Martín Elías

#LosRecuerdosDeElla #DiomedesDíaz #Vallenato 


Letra:
Voy a pone' una tiendecita pa' vender cerveza
Para yo tomarme una de vez en cuando
Para evitarme el problema de andarla buscando
Porque así es que me la paso de tienda en tienda

Porque no hay cosa mas sabrosa que abrir una nevera
Y destapar una cerveza pa curar un guayabo

Yo que la paso tomando
Pa' curar las penas mías
Con una cerveza fría
Me puedo quitar el guayabo

La tiendecita se llama los Recuerdos de Ella
Porque por ella es que bebo casi todos los días
Y amanezco enguayabado y salgo pa' la tienda
En busca de conseguir una cerveza fría
Pero me he puesto a pensar que si la tienda es mía

No mas levantarme y abrir la nevera
Y aquel que viva tomando
Porque la mujer lo deja
Que vaya a pasar el guayabo
Allá en los Recuerdos de Ella

Cuando el hombre es parrandero y es sentimental
Siempre se pone a tomar cuando algo le pasa
Muchas veces en los negocios porque le va mal
O si no es algún problema que tiene en la casa
Ay! o de pronto es desengaño de alguna muchacha
Lo entristece y entonces se pone a llorar

Y yo que beba o no beba
Siempre vivo enguayabado
Porque los recuerdos de ella
Me hacen pegar mis tragos
Porque los recuerdos de ella

#ElCondorHerido #DiomedesDíaz #Vallenato 


Letra:
Si yo pudiera alzar el vuelo
Alzar el vuelo como hace el cóndor que vuela alto muy alto
Me fuera lejos, pero bien lejos
Adonde nadie nunca supiera del papá de Rafael Santos

Porque una pena tras otra pena están acabando conmigo
Y yo por ser un hombre tan fuerte he podido resistir

Ay y no me quiero morir
Porque me duelen mis hijos
Ay y no me quiero morir
Porque me duelen mis hijos

Mejor me voy, mejor me voy
Como hace el cóndor herido
Ay mejor me voy, mejor me voy
Como hace el cóndor herido

Para que plata, si no es por eso
Porque trabajo y en cualquier parte yo me la puedo ganar
Es lo que siento aquí en el pecho
Que con dinero jamás y nunca se puede solucionar

Yo me refiero es a la señora que fue conmigo al altar
Que yo la adoro y la quiero tanto y es la mamá de mis hijos

Pero me da mucho pesar
Que me está quitando el cariño
Pero me da mucho pesar
Que me está quitando el cariño

Mejor me voy, mejor me voy
Como hace el cóndor herido
Ay mejor me voy, mejor me voy
Como hace el cóndor herido

Tiene razón ella, tiene razón
En ciertas cosas
Porque deberás yo reconozco de que si soy mujeriego
Pero ella sabe y a mí me consta
Que cuando los dos nos conocimos sabía que era parrandero

Entonces ahora después de viejo vive peleando conmigo
Si llego tarde o llegué temprano es la misma cantaleta

Ay voy a arreglar la maleta y voy a coger mi camino
Ay voy a arreglar la maleta y voy a coger mi camino

Adiós, adiós, adiós, adiós
Ya se va el cóndor herido

Adiós, adiós, adiós, adiós
Ya se va el cóndor herido

Adiós, adiós, adiós, adiós
Ya se va el cóndor herido

Adiós, adiós, adiós, adiós
Ya se va el cóndor herido

#AsíMeHizoDios #DiomedesDíaz #Vallenato 


Letra:
Me has hecho saber que ya no quieres vivir conmigo
Que vas a olvidar mis caminos, mis caminos
Yo puedo entender tu rabia toditos tus motivos
Pero yo que haré con tu olvido, con tu olvido

Vas a olvidar todos los años que te he dado
Vas a olvidar mis sentimientos mis caricias
Sólo porque el tiempo que no estoy a tu lado
Has decidido que te apartas de mi vida

A mí me pesa la culpa por las cosas que te he hecho
A mí me duele la vida por lo que ahora me pides
Yo sé que no te gustó la vida que yo he llevado
Pero así me hizo Dios contento y enamorado

Pero así me hizo Dios contento y enamorado
Si me vas a dejar déjame
Así te puedes quedar tranquila
Si me vas a dejar déjame

Así te puedes quedar tranquila
Que yo lo que hago es resignarme
Me curo solo las heridas
Que yo lo que hago es resignarme

Me curo solo las heridas
Comencé a luchar cuando me enamoraron tus besos
Pero ahora te vas y no entiendo, y no entiendo
Me vas a dejar faltando al sagrado juramento

No te importará si yo vuelvo, si yo vuelvo
A mí me duele que se acabe nuestra historia
Y que sigamos cada uno por su lado
Hoy tu pretexto es que siempre vives sola

No caes en cuenta que tú también has fallado
A mí me pesa la culpa por las cosas que te he hecho
A mí me duele la vida por lo que ahora me pides
Yo sé que no te gustó la vida que yo he llevado

Pero así me hizo Dios contento y enamorado
Pero así me hizo Dios contento y enamorado
Si me vas a dejar déjame
Así te puedes quedar tranquila

Si me vas a dejar déjame
Así te puedes quedar tranquila
Que yo lo que hago es resignarme
Me curo solo las heridas

Que yo lo que hago es resignarme
Me curo solo las heridas
Y si me vas a dejar déjame
Así te puedes quedar tranquila

Si me vas a dejar déjame
Así te puedes quedar tranquila
Que yo lo que hago es resignarme
Me curo solo las heridas
Que yo lo que hago es resignarme
Me curo solo las heridas

(Zara zara bahekta hai, mahekta hai
Aaj to mera tan badan, main pyaasi hoon
Mujhe bhar le apni baahon mein) - 2
Hai meri kasam tujhko sanam, door kahin na jaa
Yeh doori kehti hai paas mere aaja re
Yunhi baras baras kaali ghata barse
Hum yaar bheeg jaaye is chaahat ki baarish mein
Meri khuli khuli laton ko suljhaaye
Tu apni ungliyon se main to hoon isi khwaahish mein
Sardi ki raaton mein hum soye rahe ek chaadar mein
Hum dono tanha ho, na koi bhi rahe is ghar mein
Zara zara bahekta hai, mahekta hai
Aaj to mera tan badan, main pyaasi hoon
Mujhe bhar le apni baahon mein
Aaja re aa re
Tadpaaye mujhe teri sabhi baatein
Ek baar ae deewane jhootha hi sahi pyaar to kar
Main bhooli nahin haseen mulaaqaatein
Bechain karke mujhko mujhse yun na pher nazar
Roothega na mujhse, mere saathiya yeh vaada kar
Tere bina mushkil hai jeena mera mere dil mein
(Zara zara bahekta hai, mahekta hai
Aaj to mera tan badan, main pyaasi hoon

The Ed Sullivan Show was a television variety program that aired on CBS from 1948-1971. For 23 years it aired every Sunday night and played host to the world's greatest talents. The Ed Sullivan Show is well known for bringing rock n' roll music to the forefront of American culture through acts like Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones. The entertainers each week ranged from comedians like Joan Rivers and Rodney Dangerfield, to Broadway stars Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, to pop singers such as Bobby Darin and Petula Clark. It also frequently featured stars of Motown such as The Supremes, The Temptations, Stevie Wonder and The Jackson 5. The Ed Sullivan Show was one of the only places on American television where such a wide variety of popular culture was showcased and its legacy lives on to this day.

HERE COMES SANTA CLAUS (RIGHT DOWN SANTA CLAUS LANE)

HERE COMES SANTA CLAUS!
HERE COMES SANTA CLAUS!
RIGHT DOWN SANTA CLAUS LANE!
VIXEN AND BLITZEN AND ALL HIS REINDEER
ARE PULLING ON THE REINS.
BELLS ARE RINGING, CHILDREN SINGING,
ALL IS MERRY AND BRIGHT.
HANG YOUR STOCKINGS AND SAY YOUR PRAY'RS,
'CAUSE SANTA CLAUS COMES TONIGHT.

HERE COMES SANTA CLAUS!
HERE COMES SANTA CLAUS!
RIGHT DOWN SANTA CLAUS LANE!
HE'S GOT A BAG THAT IS FILLED WITH TOYS
FOR THE BOYS AND GIRLS AGAIN.
HEAR THOSE SLEIGH-BELLS JINGLE JANGLE,
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT.
JUMP IN BED, COVER UP YOUR HEAD,
'CAUSE SANTA CLAUS COMES TONIGHT.

HERE COMES SANTA CLAUS!
HERE COMES SANTA CLAUS!
RIGHT DOWN SANTA CLAUS LANE!
HE DOESN'T CARE IF YOU'RE RICH OR POOR
FOR HE LOVES YOU JUST THE SAME.
SANTA KNOWS THAT WE'RE GOD'S CHILDREN,
THAT MAKES EV'RYTHING RIGHT.
FILL YOUR HEARTS WITH A CHRISTMAS CHEER,
'CAUSE SANTA CLAUS COMES TONIGHT.

HERE COMES SANTA CLAUS!
HERE COMES SANTA CLAUS!
RIGHT DOWN SANTA CLAUS LANE!
HE'LL COME AROUND WHEN THE CHIMES RING OUT,
THEN IT'S CHRISTMAS MORN AGAIN.
PEACE ON EARTH WILL COME TO ALL
IF WE JUST FOLLOW THE LIGHT.
LET'S GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD ABOVE,
'CAUSE SANTA CLAUS COMES TONIGHT.

Dino James pens down the difficulties behind missing someone that he has loved. He feels helpless and apologetic. Ikka feels his heart sinking as he is incapable of fixing the broken relationship and cannot deal with the heartache anymore. Badshah’s verse starts by asserting that it is okay for a man to break down and go through the gut-wrenching feeling of a fleeting romance. ‘Woh’ is an extremely personal track which is bound to shake you if you have ever loved someone.

Lyrics
Dheere dheere se kaat rahi hai,
mujhe baant rahi hai tujhse yeh dooriya
Yeh bata de kya pyaar nahi tha,
khudaar kahin ka, tujhe dil kyun diya
Aage ka raasta kharab tha yeh laga tha bada Board
Mane bas yeh socha, hoga chota mota mod
Hua jab yeh haadsa, aur aaya mujhe hosh
Tab jake jana bus yahi tak thi road
Mana Meri galti thi, Meri thi saari chuk
Par teri bhi jab hoti thi mujhe deti thi looks
Maine chaha jab jaana mujhe kaha nahi kyu ruk
Kuch kehna tha par tune kar diya shussssh
Tu hai bani vajah meri siskiyo ki
aur mai hu beta karan teri hitchkiyo ki
tune bhe toh pal wo saare miss kiye honge
pata nahi tha khel yeh itne risky honge
Tujhe yaad bhi nahi aati meri that’s a little rude
Tu saath nahi mere mujhe ab bhi lage jhoot
Kyu Chatthi nahi hai sali kaali si ghata
Najane kab niklegi dhoop
Dheere dheere se kaat rahi hai,
mujhe baant rahi hai tujhse yeh dooriya
Yeh bata de kya pyaar nahi tha,
khudaar kahin ka, tujhe dil kyun diya
it’s funny kaise change ho rahe hai aapas mai saare Rishte
Pehle hug or kiss the, but Now it’s all twisted
Hamesha diya respect, naa kabhi kiya misbehave
Fir bhi tujhse keh raha hu, forgive me all my mistake
Dekhna toh kaise ho gaya hai tera D

Bas fake jhoot bolu tune kiya mujhe cheat
Baaki Ek baat toh hai ke khoke ho gaya hu deep
Ab wait karu tujh tak pahunche mere geet
Mere face pe lekha hai emotionally hu weak
Mera make hai ke kho deta hu jo hota azeez
Saale waste ho gaye hai saare dates
Ab jaise mere chest pe kisine aake rakh de ho eent
duur se hee eak duje ko hum karte hai hi
ab bhe tujhpe marta hu, I don’t know baby why
Ajeeb sa lage when I see you with some guy
Koi aake dede mujhe koi upayae
Dheere dheere se kaat rahi hai,
mujhe baant rahi hai tujhse yeh dooriya
Yeh bata de kya pyaar nahi tha,
khudaar kahin ka, tujhe dil kyun diya
Jitna mai tujhko bhoolna chahu
Utna rahe mere paas
Jane mai kab se juunjh raha hu
Samajhe naa itni se baat.
Dheere dheere se kaat rahi hai,
mujhe baant rahi hai tujhse yeh dooriya
Yeh bata de kya pyaar nahi tha,
khudaar kahin ka, tujhe dil kyun diya

Wishlist - Lyrics
Kabhi na kabhi badlega mausam,
Aur mujhpe bhi hogi khushiyon ki baarish
Ab shifarish nahi hoti meri aisi hi kharij
Bina koi chik-chik, ghit-ghit, 
khit-khit mil jaye mujhe mere saare gifts
Aur puri ho jaye jhat se meri yeh Wishlist
Meri yeh...hai… wish.

Har choti choti cheezo se mara hai maine maan
Socha kabhi toh milega mere kaamo ka return
Abhi leke apni list/ unhe karunga main tang
Sabhi ka toh ho raha hai/ mera bhi lage turn

Mummy papa ko bulana hai jaldi se mere saath
Mount Mary ke aas paas ek chota sa penthouse
Taki naste se pehle hi woh kar le pooja path
Mujhe abhi jake bapuji ne kaha hai shabash

Saare kaagaz unke naam, har cheez ka le hisaab
Roz subah unke purse mein karu apne haath saaf
Diya hain par pehente hi nahi sone ki watch
Laga laga ke main daat health ki karvata hu jaach

Mujhe award lete dekh kushi se bhar jaye unki aankh
Mere naam se hi hain budha budhi ki pehchan
Unhe saari saari balao se karu main protect
Ab no insurance/ cause ab hain Dino unlimited

Am lucky mujhe jeene ka mila hain ek maksad
Mummy khush hain/ papa kam hote ab upset
Hasi khushi se bhara hain ghar mera latpath
Finally message pahucha Rab tak

Kabhi na kabhi badlega mausam aur mujhpe bhi hogi khushiyon ki baarish
Ab sifarish nahi hoti meri aise hi kharij
Bina koi koi chick-chick, ghit-ghit, khit khit Mil Jaye mujhe mere saare gifts
Aur puri ho jaye jhat se meri yeh wish list
Meri yeh...hai… wish.

Kuch dosto ke dhande mujhe karwane hain set
Bada karna hain dad ka JIMMY ENTERPRISES
Ab no waiting list ka jhanjat  aur na tatkaal-e-ticket
flight mein bhav karke khati hain maa ab bhi biscuits

Na zyada bade sapne ,na zyada bade shauk
Bas choti choti khwaishein, aur chote chote khwab
Mummy ki shakal mujhe karni hain record
Jab girte padte wapas se aayega hancock

Muthi mein dabake rakha hain maine palak ko
Aasmaa main jaate dekha / toote bulb ko
Mangu kaise acha nahi hain mera talaffuz
Jaanu tum jante garaj ko

Haathon mein kuch nahi hain phir bhi
maane na dil yeh ziddi
Teri banavat hoon main kya karu

Roz ladta hoon kaise you should see
Feeling hai yeh good good si
Jaanu tu dekhe hain saare aasu

I just hope ke hum sabki wishes puri ho jaye yaar

Kabhi na kabhi badlega mausam aur mujhpe bhi hogi kushiyoo ke barish
Ab sifarish nahi hoti meri aise he kharij
Bina koi koi chick chick ghit ghit khit khit Mil Jaye mujhe mere saare gifts
Aur puri ho jaye jhat se meri yeh wish list
Meri yeh...hai… wish.

Lyrics:

Intro x4
Pyaar pyaar pyaar

 Verse 1:
 Koi bhi bina baatein shuru hui, yeh mat bhed
 Sun tere bin adhuri meri success
 Janboojh ke nahi bhula tera birthday
 Tu hai meetha mera choti meri cupcake
 
 Tu thi sang mere khaali the jab batwe
 Kaam badha toh fir mood hua fluctuate
 Mujhe sone se jaga de, mujhe khone se bacha le
 Mujhe hone laga thoda thoda heartbreak

 Adhura beta, tu hai toh complete
 Tujhi se bane gane Superhit
 Waise toh koi adta nahin mujhse
 Par daroon main ki tujhse na ho beef
 Udu main jaise panchi beparwah
 Hai mere peeche tera major part
 Artist hu na samjha kar na tu
 Cuddle de de, de de thoda laad

 Hook x4:
 Tu de de thoda Pyaar Pyaar Pyaar Pyaar Pyaar
 Pyaar Pyaar Pyaar
 Pyaar Pyaar Pyaar
 Pyaar Pyaar Pyaar
 Pyaar Pyaar Pyaar

 Verse 2:
 Main toh zombie hoon re tere bina murda
 Fir bhi jo bhi boloon lage tujhe ulta
 Maine dil diya aur diya gurda
 Sabhi tere liye bacha hua purja

 Main toh pyaar dera kyu deri tu BT
 Tune meri teri kyu nikali DP
 Mera sar ghoome badhe mera BP
 Ab bajoo jaise cooker ki seeti

 Bani tere liye hai Afro Beat
 Aur fir bhi tu aise karti treat
 Bakiyon ke liye hoon mai jaise hulk
 Par tere aage ho jaata hoon weak
 Hoon tujhe leke horny sara din
 Sataye mujhe morning wala pin
 Main chahke bhi padh nahi pa raha hoon
 Lage tu jaise Warney wala spin

 Hook x4:
 Tu de de thoda Pyaar Pyaar Pyaar Pyaar Pyaar
 Pyaar Pyaar Pyaar
 Pyaar Pyaar Pyaar
 Pyaar Pyaar Pyaar
 Pyaar Pyaar Pyaar
 Tu dede thoda pyaar

Lyrics: 

Verse 1

Maine comma jisko samjha, wo toh lag raha hai full stop sa
Tune batting khud hi kar li, jaana kiya tune toss kahan
Jo easy ball hai, samjhi muh pe aayi wo full toss sa
Kehne ka yeh matlab hai, tere jaate hi hoon Lost sa.
Main chain sara de kar, bus takleefein maine khareedi
Main sachi bolu, pagal ho gaya hoon sunke Arijit
Socha tu thi ghar he ki, par nikli tu Atithi
Akela rehna bhaye, ab kareeb nahi hai kareebi
Subah se main pee raha hu, par abhi bhi mujhe chadhi nahi
Bhari mera sir hai, kyuki haavi shayad Shaniji
Tera topic jab bhi aata hai toh ho jata hoon uneasy
Andar jalke, bahar sabse bolu mujhe padi nahi
Sare answer mere paas he hai, jaanke kar nahi paa raha hoon solve main
Ek bar me khatam kar sakta hoon par but I think I like installments
I know kya sahi hai mere liye, par le nahi paa raha hoon call main
Kisi ne socha tha ki breakup ke gaane karega John Wick

Kyu main aise rootha sa, dooba sa, sookha sa, chupa sa, toota sa khoya rahu.
Baatein sari, tu bata, subah se kyu bhala, hu khafa, baithe main aahein bharu

Hook
Baby I'm just so lost, I’m just so lost
Baby I'm just so lost, I’m just so lost

Verse 2
Shayad acha lag raha hai mujhe, I’m tripping on this pain now
Yeh mausam itna manhoos kyu hai? I think It’s gonna rain now
Dil ki planning fade ho rahi hai, I’m thinking from my brain now
I’m drained now, thak gaya hoon,
I just want to break this chain now
Body kaafi strong hai, beta dil se thoda weak hoon
Shuru me kafi fati thi, par ab lagta hai theek hoon
Wahi galtiyo ko dohrata hu, par aisa nahi ki seekh lu
Tujhe kutte jaise miss kar raha hoon, I know you’re missing me too

Mere soch ke yojana flop hua, aur yeh afsoos toh dil ke hai stroke sa
Ab yeh rooz ka, botla, vodka, chokra, joke sa, hausla khojta
Sare Sare dost ka rokna tokna kosna, Iss chot ka nahi koi totka
Sun tere honth ka dose toh dope tha, mai toh bus totla na koi hosh na
I'm a Rockstar, you're a rose flower,
Haath mein mere mogra tha ab hai Pokhraj,
Terko mujhe rokna tha na jab main wrong tha
Ab mere shoke ko aake thoda soke ja
Main toh baby rootla, lothada gosth ka
Pehle toh mai thoos tha, ab soft sa dhokla
Sachhi tune bahut saha jab maine no kaha, ab Lost hoon roz yahan
Ab sare sare din,un yaadon ke bus glimpse,
Bus kare mujhe pinch, yeh kaise mai sahu
Yeh kehti mujhe wind, aur deti mujhe chills
Ki aane wali zindagi tere bin na ho

Hook
Baby I'm just so lost, I’m just so lost
Baby I'm just so lost, I’m just so lost
Baby I'm just so lost, I’m just so lost
Baby I'm just so lost, I’m just so lost
