Letra ZAPATILLAS

Estoy cansado de salir de noche y ver siempre la misma gente, 
estoy flipando de que la gente se invente, cuente y luego reinvente, 
apoltronado en el sof√° de mi casa, vente se est√° caliente, 
amaestrados vamos al mismo sitio todos aunque luego ni entres, 
alucinando de que me miren de arriba a bajo como un delincuente,
intoxicado de que me pongan esa puta m√∫sica indiferente. 

Quiero entrar en tu garito con zapatillas, 
que no me miren mal al pasar, 
estoy cansado de siempre lo mismo, 
la misma historia y quiero cambiar, 
me da pena tanta tonter√≠a, 
quiero un poquito de normalidad, 
pero a ver, m√≠rame, y dime tronco, no veo ni un sitio y no puedo aparcar. 

Estoy muy harto de que me digan: Si no est√°s en lista no puedes pasar, 
solo entran cuatro, tenemos zona supermegaguay y nunca la ver√°s. 
Abarrotado, hay aforo limitado y ahora toca esperar, 
y, y, nos han multado y tu coche se ha llevado la grua municipal. 

Quiero entrar en tu garito con zapatillas, 
que no me miren mal al pasar, 
estoy cansado de siempre lo mismo, 
la misma historia y quiero cambiar, 
me da pena tanta tonter√≠a, 
quiero un poquito de normalidad, 
pero a ver, m√≠rame, y dime tronco, no veo ni un sitio y no puedo aparcar. 

Ya has aparcado el coche y ahora busca lo del ticket de la hora
Y cuando vuelvas a ponerlo te habr√°n puesto una receta de recuerdo
Quiero entrar en tu garito con zapatillas
Que no me miren mal al pasar
Estoy cansado de siempre lo mismo
La misma historia y quiero cambiar
Me da pena tanta tonter√≠a
Quiero un poquito de normalidad
Pero a ver, m√≠rame, y dime tronco, no veo ni un sitio
Quiero entrar en tu garito con zapatillas
Que no me miren mal al pasar
Estoy cansado de siempre lo mismo
La misma historia quiero cambiar
Me da pena tanta tonter√≠a
Quiero un poquito de normalidad
Pero a ver, m√≠rame, y dime tronco
No veo ni un sitio y no puedo aparcar

LETRA

No s√© si quedan amigos
Ni si existe el amor
Si puedo contar contigo
Para hablar de dolor
Si existe alguien que escuche
Cuando alzo la voz
Y no sentirme sola

Puede ser que la vida me gu√≠e hasta el sol
Puede ser que el mal domine tus horas
O que toda tu risa le gane ese pulso al dolor
Puede ser que lo malo sea hoy

Naces y vives solo
Naces y vives solo
Naces y vives solo

Voy haciendo mis planes
Voy sabiendo quien soy
Voy buscando mi parte
Voy logrando el control
Van jugando contigo
Van rompiendo tu amor
Van dej√°ndote solo

Naces y vives solo
Naces y vives solo
Puede Ser

Algo puede mejorar
Algo que pueda encontrar
Algo que me d√© ese aliento
Que me ayude a imaginar
Y yo lo quiero lograr
Y s√≥lo quiero recordar
Y darle tiempo a este momento
Que me ayude a superar
Que me d√© tu sentimiento",True,True,40209501.0,Not Found

Letra de Una Foto En Blanco Y Negro de El Canto del Loco:
Solamente oir tu voz
ver tu foto en blanco y negro
recorrer esa ciudad
yo ya me muero de amor
ver la vida sin reloz
o contarte mis secretos
no saber ya si besarte
o esperar a que salga solo

y vivir as√≠, yo quiero vivir as√≠
ni siquiera s√© si sientes t√∫ lo mismo...

Me despert√© so√±ando, que estaba a tu lado
y me qued√© pensando, que tienen esas manos
s√© que no es el momento, para que pase algo
quiero volverte a ver, quiero volverte a ver
quiero volverte a ver

Y me siento como un ni√±o,
imagin√°ndome contigo,
como si hubi√©ramos ganado por habernos conocido
esta sensaci√≥n extra√±a
que se adue√±a de mi cara
juega con esta sonrisa
dibuj√°ndola a sus anchas 

y vivir as√≠, yo quiero vivir as√≠
ni siquiera s√© si sientes t√∫ lo mismo...

Me despert√© so√±ando, que estaba a tu lado
y me qued√© pensando, que tienen esas manos
s√© que no es el momento, para que pase algo
quiero volverte a ver, quiero volverte a ver
quiero volverte a ver

Ni siquiera s√© si sientes t√∫ lo mismo...

Me despert√© so√±ando, que estaba a tu lado
y me qued√© pensando, que tienen esas manos
s√© que no es el momento, para que pase algo
quiero volverte a ver, quiero volverte a ver
quiero volverte a ver!

Letra Volver√° de El Canto del Loco:
Me acuerdo y pienso el tiempo que llev√°bamos sin vernos,
Dos ni√±os peque√±os que lo sent√≠an todo,
Pero lo sigo sintiendo hoy por ti,
Recuerdos que tengo,
No entiendo que dej√°ramos de vernos buscando
Mil besos que no son nuestros besos,
Deseo estar contigo hasta morir
Desesper√°ndome te buscaba en mis sue√±os y ahog√°ndome
Volver√° seguro que volver√°
Y sigo sintiendo te hecho de menos
Que acabe mi soledad volver√°
Te juro que volver√° ese amor verdadero
Cuando era peque√±o seguro que volver√°, volver√°
Te miro te miro mi tiempo y siento que tu eres lo que quiero
Mi ni√±a mi sue√±o todo eso que no tengo
Y q sigo sintiendo hoy por ti
Incluso en mis sue√±os me invento y creo q te tengo te toco,
Tu cuerpo y se que eso no es cierto
Me estoy acojon√°ndome sin ti
Desesper√°ndome te buscaba en mis sue√±os y ahog√°ndome volver√°
Seguro que volver√° y sigo sintiendo
Te hecho de menos que acabe mi soledad
Volver√° te juro que volver√° ese amor verdadero cuando era peque√±o
Seguro que volver√°, volver√°
Desesper√°ndome te buscaba en mis sue√±os y ahog√°ndome
Volver√° seguro que volver√°
Y sigo sintiendo te hecho de menos
Que acabe mi soledad volver√°
Te juro que volver√° ese amor verdadero cuando era peque√±o
Seguro que volver√°, y volver√°

Revivo aquel momento que me hizo perder 
esos pocos papeles que yo puedo tener

Es que la madre de Jos√É¬© me est√É¬° volviendo loco

Lyrics:

Your cruel device,
Your blood like ice.
One look could kill,
My pain, your thrill.

I wanna love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison

You're poison runnin through my veins
You're poison, I don't wanna break these chains.

Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace on sweat",True,True,328124343.0,hard rock

Formed in 1968, the original Alice Cooper band forged a theatrical brand of hard rock that was destined to shock and had never been seen before. Within five years they would release no fewer than seven studio albums, amongst them their international breakthrough School's Out (including the Top 10 hit of the same name) and the US #1 Billion Dollar Babies (1973).
By 1974, the band had risen to the upper echelon of rock stardom... and then, it dissolved.
 
In October 2015, over 40 years later, record store owner and superfan Chris Penn convinced the original line-up to reunite for a very special performance at Good Records, his record store in Dallas, Texas, USA.
 
Alice Cooper (vocals), Michael Bruce (guitar), Dennis Dunaway (bass) and Neal Smith (drums) were joined on stage by Alice‚Äôs current guitarist Ryan Roxie (standing in for the late Glen Buxton). A packed audience was expecting to attend Dennis Dunaway‚Äôs Snakes! Guillotines! Electric Chairs!‚Äô book signing‚Ä¶ but they ended up witnessing a full-blown happening.
 
This legendary reunion show includes all-time classics such as ‚ÄúNo More Mr. Nice Guy‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Eighteen‚Äù and ‚ÄúSchool‚Äôs Out‚Äù, and is now available for the very first time worldwide.
 
Luckily, the event was also filmed. The documentary movie ‚ÄúLive From The Astroturf, Alice Cooper‚Äù (edited and directed by Steven Gaddis) was very warmly welcomed at Film Festivals all over the world by music fans as well as rock journalists. The documentary won multiple awards for its coverage
of the historic event. This movie is included in the live album‚Äôs first print CD and Vinyl LP editions.

Lyrics: 
I remember every little thing
As if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl
Looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school
They were wishing they were me that night

And now our bodies are, oh, so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon, hold on tight
C'mon, hold on tight

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light

Lyrics: 
Baby we can talk all night
But that ain't getting us nowhere
I told you everything I possibly can
There's nothing left inside of here

And maybe you can cry all night
But that'll never change the way I feel
The snow is really piling up outside
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here

I poured it on and I poured it out
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long
I'm crying icicles instead of tears

Lyrics: 

It was a hot summer night
and the beach was burning.
There was fog crawling over the sand.
When I listen to your heart
I hear the whole world turning.
I see the shooting stars falling
through your trembling hands. 

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
And I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you.
And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
And I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you.

He was noted for his powerful, wide-ranging voice and theatrical live shows. He is on the list of best-selling music artists. His Bat Out of Hell trilogy ‚Äî Bat Out of Hell (1977), Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell (1993), and Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose (2006) ‚Äî has sold more than 65 million albums worldwide.The first album stayed on the charts for over nine years, still sells an estimated 200,000 copies annually, and is on the list of best-selling albums.
After the commercial success of Bat Out of Hell and Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell, and earning a Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for the song ""I'd Do Anything for Love"", Aday nevertheless experienced some difficulty establishing a steady career within the United States.The key to this success was his popularity in Europe, especially in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with him receiving the 1994 Brit Award in the United Kingdom for best-selling album and single. He appeared in the 1997 film Spice World and he ranked 23rd for the number of weeks spent on the UK charts in 2006. He ranks 96th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"".

Aday appeared in over 50 films and television shows, sometimes as himself or as characters resembling his stage persona. His film roles include Eddie in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) and Robert Paulsen in Fight Club (1999). His early stage work included dual roles in the original Broadway theatre cast of The Rocky Horror Show. He also appeared in the musical Hair, both on and Off-Broadway.

The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a 1975 musical comedy horror film by 20th Century Fox, produced by Lou Adler and Michael White and directed by Jim Sharman. The screenplay was written by Sharman and actor Richard O'Brien, who is also a member of the cast. The film is based on the 1973 musical stage production The Rocky Horror Show, with music, book, and lyrics by O'Brien. The production is a parody tribute to the science fiction and horror B movies of the 1930s through to the early 1960s. Along with O'Brien, the film stars Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, and Barry Bostwick and is narrated by Charles Gray with cast members from the original Royal Court Theatre, Roxy Theatre, and Belasco Theatre productions including Nell Campbell and Patricia Quinn.
The story centres on a young engaged couple whose car breaks down in the rain near a castle where they seek a telephone to call for help. The castle or country home is occupied by strangers in elaborate costumes celebrating an annual convention. They discover the head of the house is Dr. Frank N. Furter, an apparently mad scientist who actually is an alien transvestite from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania, who creates a living muscle man named Rocky in his laboratory.
The film was shot in the United Kingdom at Bray Studios and on location at an old country estate named Oakley Court, best known for its earlier use by Hammer Film Productions. A number of props and set pieces were reused from the Hammer horror films. Although the film is both a parody of and tribute to many kitsch science fiction and horror films, costume designer Sue Blane conducted no research for her designs. Blane has claimed that her creations for the film directly affected the development of punk rock fashion trends such as torn fishnet stockings and colourfully-dyed hair.
Initial reception was extremely negative, but it soon became a hit as a midnight movie when audiences began participating with the film at the Waverly Theater in New York City in 1976. Audience members returned to the cinemas frequently and talked back to the screen and began dressing as the characters, spawning similar performance groups across the United States. At almost the same time, fans in costume at the King's Court Theater in Pittsburgh began performing alongside the film. This ""shadow cast"" mimed the actions on screen above and behind them, while lip-syncing their character's lines.
Still in limited release in 2022, some 46 years after its premiere, it is the longest-running theatrical release in film history. In many cities live amateur shadow-casts act out the film as it is being shown and heavily draw upon a tradition of audience participation",False,False,20266537.0,rock music

A rebel and I don't hide                            
Remember all the words that you said          

Even if the love was hurtin'
I'll be yours, I‚Äôll be yours again
I can feel that fire‚Äôs burnin' 
Give me more

So tell me would you feel my love?
'Cause I can never get enough 
So tell me would you feel my love?

Yeah I could never leave
Cause I need it, that feeling
Let me feel your love
Let me feel your love   

You can make me let go
Forget about the world for a while
You had me at hello
I‚Äôm drownin' in the blue of your eyes

Even if the love was hurtin'
I'll be yours, I‚Äôll be yours again
I can feel that fire‚Äôs burnin' 
Give me more

So tell me would you feel my love?
'Cause I can never get enough 
So tell me would you feel my love?

Yeah I could never leave
Cause I need it, that feeling
Let me feel your love  

'Cause I can never get enough 
So tell me would you feel my love?

Lyrics:

I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive

I'll fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again...

Crowe portrays the loyal Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when the Emperor's ambitious son, Commodus, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murder of his family and his Emperor.

Released in the United States on May 5, 2000, Gladiator was a box office success, receiving positive reviews, and was credited with briefly reviving the historical epic. The film was nominated for and won multiple awards, particularly five Academy Awards in the 73rd Academy Awards including Best Picture. Although there have been talks of both a prequel and sequel, as of 2012, no production has begun.
Gladiator is the original soundtrack of the 2000 film of the same name. The original score and songs were composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard and was released in 2000, entitled Gladiator: Music From the Motion Picture. The Lyndhurst Orchestra performing the score was conducted by Gavin Greenaway.

The album won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and was also nominated for the Academy Award and BAFTA Award for Best Score (""Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music"").
The Oscar-nominated score was composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, and conducted by Gavin Greenaway. Lisa Gerrard's vocals are similar to her own work on The Insider score.[42] The music for many of the battle scenes has been noted as similar to Gustav Holst's ""Mars: The Bringer of War"", and in June 2006, the Holst Foundation sued Hans Zimmer for allegedly copying the late Gustav Holst's work.[43][44] Another close musical resemblance occurs in the scene of Commodus's triumphal entry into Rome, accompanied by music clearly evocative of two sections‚Äîthe Prelude to Das Rheingold and Siegfried's Funeral March from G√∂tterd√§mmerung‚Äîfrom Wagner's Ring of the Nibelungs. The ""German"" war chant in the opening scene was borrowed from the 1964 film Zulu, one of Ridley Scott's favorite movies. On February 27, 2001, nearly a year after the first soundtrack's release, Decca produced Gladiator: More Music From the Motion Picture. Then, on September 5, 2005, Decca produced Gladiator: Special Anniversary Edition, a two-CD pack containing both the above mentioned releases. Some of the music from the film was featured in the NFL playoffs in January 2003 before commercial breaks and before and after half-time.[45] In 2003, Luciano Pavarotti released a recording of himself singing a song from the film and said he regretted turning down an offer to perform on the soundtrack.[46] The Soundtrack is one of the best selling film scores of all time, and also among the most popular.

Letra ""Tierra Firme"":

sigo buscando afuera
sigo domando la espera
repitiendo heridas
que ganas de irme.

sigo pero a mi manera
sigo colgado de la palmera
reviviendo el dia
que empece a redirme.

era un futuro en cada parte
eramos una obra de arte
era mas seguro evitarte
que sumergirme.

Pasabamos la noche entera
dos locos en la tierra firme
nos ganar pero tampoco
se rendirme.

pasabamos la noche entera
mi juramento sigue vivo
cierro los ojos y me siento
ahi ahi contigo
pasabamos contigo.

sigo pensando sin parar pero cuidado
que el tiempo vuela y nosotros caminamos quiz√°s duela si nos olvidamos.

""Nothing's Gonna Change My Love for You"" is a song written by composers Michael Masser and Gerry Goffin. It was originally recorded by American singer and guitarist George Benson for his studio album 20/20, released by Warner Bros. Records. This original version was produced by co-writer Masser, and was released as a single in Europe only in 1985. Two years later, in 1987, Hawaiian singer Glenn Medeiros sang his cover version, which became a worldwide success.

George Washington Benson (born March 22, 1943) is an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He began his professional career at the age of 19 as a jazz guitarist.
A former child prodigy, Benson first came to prominence in the 1960s, playing soul jazz with Jack McDuff and others. He then launched a successful solo career, alternating between jazz, pop, R&B singing, and scat singing. His album Breezin' was certified triple-platinum, hitting no. 1 on the Billboard album chart in 1976. His concerts were well attended through the 1980s, and he still has a large following. Benson has been honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

This song reached no. 3 in the Dutch Tipparade on 8 June 1985.
This TopPop broadcast was on 22 April 1985.

If I had to live my life without you near me
The days would all be empty
The nights would seem so long
With you I see forever, oh, so clearly
I might have been in love before
But it never felt this strong

Our dreams are young and we both know
They'll take us where we want to go
Hold me now, touch me now
I don't want to live without you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You oughta know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You oughta know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through
But nothing's gonna change my love for you

If the road ahead is not so easy
Our love will lead the way for us
Like a guiding star
I'll be there for you if you should need me
You don't have to change a thing
I love you just the way you are

So come with me and share the view
I'll help you see forever too
Hold me now, touch me now
I don't want to live without you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You oughta know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You oughta know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through
But nothing's gonna change my love for

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You oughta know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love

Nothing's gonna change my love for you

Lyrics:
Whenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party starts to come alive
Until the day is dawning
You can throw out all the blues and hit the city lights

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night (Give me, give me)
(Alright, tonight)
Gimme the night (Give me, give me)
(Every night)

You need the evening action (Ba-dubadub-dubadub-dubadub)
A place to dine, a glass of wine, a little late romance
It's a chain reaction (Ba-dubadub-dubadub-dubadub)
You'll see the people of the world coming out to dance

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night (Give me, give me)
(Every night)
Gimme the night (Give me, give me)
(Alright, tonight)

So come on out tonight and we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise
And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see that starlight
Look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly

Just gimme the night (Give me, give me)
(Alright, tonight)
Gimme the night (Give me, give me)
(Every night)

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night (Give me, give me)

So come on out tonight and we'll lead the others

And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see that starlight
Look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly

And if we stay together (Ba-dubadub-dubadub-dubadub)
We'll feel the rhythm of the evening taking us up high
Never mind the weather (Ba-dubadub-dubadub-dubadub)
We'll be dancing in the street until the morning light

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere

Lyrics:
I heard he sang a lullaby
I heard he sang it from his heart
When I found out thought I would die
Because that lullaby was mine
I heard he sealed it with a kiss
He gently kissed her cherry lips
I found that so hard to believe
Because his kiss belonged to me

How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch my falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?

Lyrics (Letra)
When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;
When troubles come and my heart burdened be;
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,
Until you come and sit awhile with me.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up... To more than I can be.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up... To more than I can be.

There is no life - no life without its hunger;
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly;
But when you come and I am filled with wonder,
Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up... To more than I can be.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up... To more than I can be.

You raise me up... To more than I can be.

Lyrics:

Baby sneezes
Mommy pleases
Daddy breezes in
So good on paper
So romantic
But so bewildering
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart
You pay the grocer
You fix the toaster
You kiss the host goodbye
Then you break a window
Burn the souffle
Scream a lullaby
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again",True,True,99926514.0,rock music

The real finds on ""Boys in the Trees"" are when she (pardon the pun) branches out. ""Tranquillo"" finds Simon in a lightly funky disco setting...

~excerpt from a review by John Jones
http://www.amazon.com/Boys-Trees-Carly-Simon/dp/B001ET083U

In a 1978 review of the album in Rolling Stone, Janet Maslin wrote that Paul McCartney ""was confident that he'd successfully made the transition, in his audience's mind, from boyish sex symbol to full grown family man."" The same, she implied, was true for Carly Simon. Well, heh, I'm not at all sure Carly Simon has ever ceased to be a sex symbol, blessed as she is with being one of rock's most photogenic stars as well as ""the subject of a succession of provocative, classy, groundbreaking album covers."" But this particular song finds her torn between being a dancing queen and a mom‚Äîand lovingly siding with the mom part. And that's why I like the heart of this song as well as its gorgeous westcoast sound.

~thatMimosaGrove

***

Btw, the album cover has always intrigued me and I recently discovered the following:

Among all of Carly Simon's album covers, Boys in the Trees stands as the pi√®ce de r√©sistance. The inspiration for this sultry, sophisticated image was of course the album's stunning title song. A steamy portrait of the longing, guilt and hesitation that accompanies adolescent sexual awakening, the song's lyrics are among Carly's most introspective and incisive, while the accompaniment - a trio of acoustic guitars that strum and pluck and arrive at sudden, dramatic flourishes - serves as a perfect musical landscape for the swirl of feelings the song depicts. 

It was Carly's own idea that the cover photograph should be a surreal representation of the song. She initially imagined being photographed ""in a child-sized bed, with huge trees outside looking threatening"", but she credited the photographer Deborah Turbeville with arriving at an even more surreal concept. It was Turbeville, whose work often centres on dancers, who chose the ballet studio as the setting for the album's photographs. On the cover, and by placing her subject off-centre, Turbeville emphasizes the vast emptiness of the studio, and thereby allows Carly's presence - the curve of her body, her thoughtful glance, her delicate pull on the stocking and the silky smoothness of her skirt - to fill the space. The light dusting of foliage on the floor adds to the effect, drawing us into her imagination, and allowing us to speculate on what quietly delicious thoughts are prompting that very slight, sensuous, contemplative smile.

It is an image that cannot be taken literally, and so it is more imaginative and feminine than it is intrusive or leering. Thus, it was only right and proper that, while Carly was actually topless during the photo session, a top was painted on to the photograph, covering her bare breasts.

Lyrics:
O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by.
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight
In thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight
O holy Child of Bethlehem,
Descend to us, we pray,
Cast out our sin, and enter in,
Be born in us today!
 
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell.
O come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel.
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel

""While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks"" (also known as ""Whilst Shepherds Watched Their Flocks,"" ""While Shepherds Watched"" or ""The Vision of the Shepherds""[citation needed]) is a Christmas carol with words attributed to Irish hymnist, lyricist and England's Poet Laureate, Nahum Tate.

The exact date of Tate's composition is not known, but the words appeared in Tate and Nicholas Brady's 1700 supplement to their New Version of the Psalms of David of 1696. It was the only Christmas hymn authorised to be sung by the Anglican Church; before 1700 only the Psalms of David were permitted to be sung. It is written in common metre and based on the Gospel of Luke 2:8-14, although the gospel's ""peace on earth to men of good will"" is modified to the more encompassing ""goodwill henceforth from heaven to men"". It is the only one of the sixteen works in the 1700 supplement to still be sung today.

        While shepherds watched their flocks by night, 
all seated on the ground; 
the angel of the Lord came down, 
and glory shone around, 
and glory shone around. 

""Fear not!"" said he, for mighty dread 
had seized their troubled mind. 
""Glad tidings of great joy I bring 
to all of humankind, 
to all of humankind."" 

""To you, in David's town, this day 
is born of David's line 
a Savior, who is Christ the Lord, 
and this shall be the sign,
and this shall be the sign:"" 

""The heavenly babe you there shall find 
to human view displayed, 
all meanly wrapped in swathing bands, 
and in a manger laid, 
and in a manger laid."" 

Thus spake the seraph and forthwith 
appeared a shining throng 
of angels praising God on high, 
who thus addressed their song, 
who thus addressed their song: 

""All glory be to God on high, 
and to the earth be peace; 
good will henceforth from heaven to earth 
begin and never cease, 
begin and never cease!""",False,False,2964047.0,Not Found

It was during Bach‚Äôs first months as cantor and he reused music that he had to hand, as he often did. Bach had already written most of BWV 147 in 1716, as an advent cantata for the court chapel in Weimar, but it was only in Leipzig that he added the recitatives with instrumental accompaniment and the well-known chorale. So Bach turned a concise cantata (opening chorus, four arias and probably a simple closing chorale) into a big two-part cantata.

Recorded for the project All of Bach on December 13th 2018 at the Grote Kerk, Naarden. If you want to help us complete All of Bach, please subscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/2vhCeFB and consider donating http://bit.ly/2uZuMj5.

The final verse of 'Once in royal David's city', with descant by Sir Stephen Cleobury, from King's College Choir's new album 'In the bleak midwinter'. The Choir of King's College, Cambridge, is directed by Daniel Hyde.

The album reflects a Christmas that was unlike any other in recent history. Much of the music on this album was heard around the world as part of the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, a service that has been broadcast live from King‚Äôs on Christmas Eve every year since 1930.

But for Christmas Eve 2020 in the face of a global pandemic, the continuation of this uniquely long-running tradition was not possible ‚Äì not sung live or with a congregation in the Chapel as well as the global audience who have long listened from around the world. Instead, a full service, with lessons, carols, organ voluntaries and prayers, was recorded in an empty Chapel. For its millions of listeners, the broadcast meant the continuation of a Christmas tradition in a year when so many were without their friends and family, and without so much of what makes Christmas special.

This album contains music from the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols together with a selection of specially recorded tracks. It marks the beginning of a new era for the Choir of King‚Äôs College under the direction of Daniel Hyde, with this his first full album at King‚Äôs since his appointment in 2019.

T√°
Entendi
Tr√™s da manh√£ me chamando 
Sei
Fala a√≠ 
S√≥ n√£o precisa falar eu te amo
Quando a gente tava junto
Voc√™ s√≥ vacilava
E agora t√° ligando essa hora 
Pra dizer que me amava 

Amava porra nenhuma 
Deixa de onda 
Para com isso
N√£o vai me enganar 

Amava
porra nenhuma 
Pode falar
Tu s√≥ lembra de mim
Quando tu quer transar 

Amava porra nenhuma 
Deixa de onda 
Para com isso
N√£o vai me enganar 

Amava
porra nenhuma 
Pode falar
Tu s√≥ lembra de mim
Quando tu quer transar 

Amava porra nenhuma

Amava porra nenhuma 
sua mentirosa, vem cheia de gracinha querendo me enganar
saudade porra nenhuma, deixa de hist√≥ria
manda mensagenzinha querendo me encontrar
amava porra nenhuma
puta que me pariu
sua amiga falsa me viu 
eu tava de glock a cal√ßa dela quase caiu
ela quis pagar um boque, ah what a fuck
ah, fala que tu nem viu, fala que n√≥s √© o terror do rio
Olha com quem voc√™ anda, s√≥ se lembra que voc√™ n√£o me manda 
afters, lovers, nos stories sua bunda se move!
no Direct, nude chove!
Nosso bonde odeia X9
Seu bumbum marrom, tu √© minha musa do ver√£o
meu cora√ß√£o s√≥ mente quando te ama

Quando a gente tava junto
Voc√™ s√≥ vacilava
E agora t√° ligando essa hora 
Pra dizer que me amava 

Amava porra nenhuma 
Deixa de onda 
Para com isso
N√£o vai me enganar 

Amava porra nenhuma 
Pode falar
C√™ s√≥ lembra de mim
Quando tu quer transar

Amava porra nenhuma

LETRA - S√ì VOC√ä

Para pra pensar se a gente √© acidente
Se foi por acaso que o beijo rolou
Deve ser coisa de Deus na minha frente 
porque de (oh senhor) tantas bocas a nossa encaixou (agora sim)

Voc√™ nem precisa preocupar, amores eu vivi, mas todos me levaram a voc√™ (a voc√™) 
esse tal amor, que eu nunca vi enfim chegou

(2x) 
S√≥ preciso de voc√™ 
S√≥ voc√™ 
Me dando aquela sentada 
Seu bumbum me faz querer 
Sem querer querendo 
Te ver sem pelada

Eu te prometo que meu corpo eu te empresto
Eu te prometo que meu p** eu te empresto

Vamos combinar assim, s√≥ ligar pra mim
Fala quando quer, que eu digo que tamb√©m te quero

Se ta dando certo n√£o mexe pra dar errado
√â s√≥ tu me chamar de quadro
Chacoalhando o rabo

Eu falei Dennis, n√£o falei t√™nis, n√£o confunda

Letra oficial / Lyrics:

Escucha hermano la canci√≥n de la alegr√≠a
El canto alegre del que espera un nuevo d√≠a

Ven canta, sue√±a cantando
Vive so√±ando el nuevo sol
En que los hombres volver√°n a ser hermanos

Ven canta, sue√±a cantando
Vive so√±ando el nuevo sol
En que los hombres volver√°n a ser hermanos

Si en tu camino solo existe la tristeza
Y el llanto amargo de la soledad completa

Ven canta, sue√±a cantando
Vive so√±ando el nuevo sol
En que los hombres volver√°n a ser hermanos

Si es que no encuentras la alegr√≠a en esta tierra
B√∫scala hermano m√°s all√° de las estrellas

Ven canta, sue√±a cantando
Vive so√±ando el nuevo sol
En que los hombres volver√°n a ser hermanos

Si es que no encuentras la alegr√≠a en esta tierra
B√∫scala hermano m√°s all√° de las estrellas

Letra/Lyrics:

Nos falt√≥ una noche de franela
De pijama feo y calcet√≠n por fuera
De sof√° con ducha fr√≠a y traicionera
Con masaje, crema, una copita y velas
 
Nos falt√≥ una mentira entera
Una falsa espera y una tarde fea
Nos falt√≥ desdibujar tu nombre
Y nuestro coraz√≥n de toda la escalera
 
Nos falt√≥ una s√°bana de Ikea
Un viaje de cart√≥n, un despertar de seda
Un d√≠a remol√≥n y una caricia vieja
Un v√°monos pa‚Äô all√° y un sea donde sea
 
Nos falt√≥ una noche sin dormir
Y un baile de sal√≥n en una calle estrecha
Nos falt√≥ descaminar Madrid
Desencallar el fin y reservar la fecha
 
Y sobraron los cuatro disparos
Que con tanto descaro nos dio el coraz√≥n
 
Y sobraron los veinte pu√±ales
Y es que a veces la vida no atiende a raz√≥n
Y entre sobras y sobras me faltas
Y me faltan las sobras que ten√≠a tu amor
Y sobraron las quinientas veces que dijimos que no
 
Nos faltaron un par de se√±ales
Unos cuantos rivales
Y un trocito de adi√≥s
Nos falt√≥ despertar con abrazos
Nos falt√≥ una deriva por dos
 
Y sobraron los cuatro finales
Que con tanto detalle nos dio el coraz√≥n
 
Y sobr√≥ lo de ser incapaces
Y es que a veces no afina ni rima el valor
Y entre sobras y sobras me faltas
Y me faltan las sobras que ten√≠a tu amor
Y sobraron las quinientas veces que dijimos que no
 
Y sobraron los cuatro disparos
Que con tanto descaro nos dio el coraz√≥n
 
Y sobraron los veinte pu√±ales
Y es que a veces la vida no atiende a raz√≥n

Lyrics:
Ayy, nigga, get your weed, get your blow
Get your drank together
'Cause we 'bout to get high

Half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some‚Äî
Bring that dro and plenty P
Half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some‚Äî
Bring that dro and plenty P

Nose all runny, found a snow bunny
Take her to the crib, make her drink cummy
I'm from the hood, I ain't never did this
But now I can say that I done done it
Cocaine Blain, that's my dawg
I called him up to house this slut
We gon' fuck her in the back of the bus
And fill her nose up full of that dust
Three 6 Mafia, wild on tour
Whoopin' these niggas and fuckin' these whores
In the bathroom 'bout two whole hours
Gettin' real high, passed out on the floor
Fuck that shit, niggas out the frame
Take a one-on-one, back in the game
Back on the street, back on the strip
Lookin' for a freak to run a train
[Verse 2: Crunchy Black]
What you boys doin' with that weed?
Where you boys goin' with that shit?
Beggin' like a little kid
Give the homie a little bit
I ain't ever smoke, yeah, I smoke
Cheefin' on that indo dope
Hypnotize better, we make cheddar
All the haters hit the road (Kill yourself!)

Half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some‚Äî
Bring that dro and plenty P
Half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some‚Äî
Bring that dro and plenty P

My nostrils so stopped up, I can't even smell the weed smoke
The green man done got locked up so I better make the best out this dro
I sniff, I choke, I really enjoy myself
It might seem like I'm sick but that done kicked in and got me there
I got a couple of chocolate thangs, I got me a couple of white thangs
I got me a couple of Chinese bitches, that pussy really sideways
A gallon bag, zip lock, filled to the brim with a pound in it
Me and Scarecrow gon' fuck these hoes, mane, and put a dent in it
[Verse 4: Crunchy Black]
DJ Paul, that's my dawg
We break down walls like King Kong
Any nigga roll up, I pass me the RAW
We smoke so much, call us Cheech and Chong
High as a bird, no, as a plane
It got me high, I'm feelin' this, mane
Ain't no shame in my game
Give your boy that co-cocaine

Half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some‚Äî
Bring that dro and plenty P
Half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some blow
Half on a s‚Äî, half-half on a sack of some‚Äî
Bring that dro and plenty P

Lyrics:

I'm trill working the wheel, a pimp, not a simp
Keep the dope fiends higher than the Goodyear Blimp
We eat so many shrimp, I got iodine poisoning
Fuck niggas make me sick with all that pinching and bargaining
You say that you a boss, I ain't believing that shit
You got the funny Geneva watch, with the Ferrari kit
Take that monkey shit off, you embarrassing us
I got the red promethazine, thick orange, and yellow tuss
Hydrocodone on the hands-free phone
The '84 Brougham on them blades, twenty-inch chrome
If you got sixteen, you can get a bizzerd
I'm choking on that doja sweet and sipping on that sizzurp

Lyrics:

Now every since I could remember I been poppin' my collar
Poppin', poppin' my collar, poppin', poppin' my collar
Every since I could remember I been working these hoes
And they better put my money in my hand

I know you sicker than sick-ahh
When you see the rims flick-ahh
Paint drip off
Ice in my Range glitt-ahh
I straight flippa
The cheese like pancake
Foldin' my cheese like the leaves
In my hand bricka?
Project Pat-ter
Attracted to dime pieces
I'm dirty southern
French braids, gold teeth
I'm out here makin' sense
Plus, I'm out here makin' dollars
I keep a bad broad, though
And a popped collar

Lyrics:
[Juicy J]
Let me chirp these fools

Juice got weed Juice got pills
Juice got the work on the corner cutting deals
Juice know you haters out there snitching ain't for real
So Juice got some gang niggas down for the kill
Juice know the feds got surveillance on the field
We never had a job but we sitting on a mill
We ball out in the club wit our niggas staying trill
We never wrote a check just them big face bills
A player drinking Makers Marka, cranberry vodka
Wearing a mink coat thats furry as Chewbacca
I saw ya main girl and a player had to stop her
Her name wasn't Silkk but her face was The Shocker
The feds taking pictures of us balling but I got 'em
A 7 footer hole for his body we gonna drop 'em
We always on the grind we be watching when they watching
And when they turn they back its the clucka-clucka-rock 'em yeah!

[Chorus - Project Pat x2]
If you boys got beef we can (roll wit it)
In the club or the street we can (go wit it)
It don't make me none (blow for blow wit it}
Crack his head wit a gun (I'ma sho split it)

[DJ Paul]
We got them tones in the club and them bulletproof vests
Them three fifty seven titanium Smith-N-Wess
And plus we deep as hell and prepared to bust
You gonna have hell if you fuck wit us and thats whats up
The whole club we maintain
These hydrashock bullets mushroom in ya brain
We in bed with the med we give 'em something to do
Cause clown ass niggas love to act a fool

[Crunchy Blac]
My hood is real nigga my hood ain't fake
My hood is home nigga everything straight
My hood will rob you with mask on they face
My hood will do it to put food on they plate
My hood ain't tame dog they wanna jump fool
My hood they hang together they all jump you
And if you don't believe me then come to my hood
And you will see that it ain't all good
