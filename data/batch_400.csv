Lyrics:
 No me importa lo que de mí se diga
Vida usted su vida, que yo vivo la mía
Que solo es una, disfruta el momento
Que el tiempo se acaba y pa'trás no vira
Bebiendo, fumando y jodiendo
Sigo vacilando de party to' los día'
Síguelo, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (Farru)
Síguelo, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (la rola y pepa)
Pepa y agua pa' la seca
To' el mundo en pastilla' en la discoteca
Pepa y agua pa' la seca
To' el mundo en pastilla' en la discoteca
Desacata'o
Empastilla'o
Qué maldita nota
Arcoíris
Fa-Fa-rru
Sube las mano' y las botella' pa' arriba (¡blep!)
Siempre la movie la tenemo' prendi'a
Hoy vamo' a darle hasta que se haga de día
Sigo rulay y 'toy en la mía
Salió el sol, wol
Tráeme la hookah y el alcohol
Y préndelo, oh-oh, woh-oh-oh
Esto se salió de control
Y síguelo, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (la rola y pepa)
Pepa y agua pa' la seca
To' el mundo en pastilla' en la discoteca (desacata'o)
Pepa y agua pa' la seca
To' el mundo en pastilla' en la discoteca (empastilla'o)
¡Blep!
Fa-Fa-rru
Qué maldita nota
Arcoíris
No me importa lo que de mí se diga
Vida usted su vida, que yo vivo la mía
Que solo es una, disfruta el momento
Que el tiempo se acaba y pa'trás no vira

Letra: 
Gangalee

Ra’ Rauw
¿Cómo le puedo hacer?
Pa’ convencerte 
A solas quiero tenerte…

¿Qué tú harás si te digo?
Mis fantasías contigo
Susurrado al oído
Te comienzas a calentar…

Tú me dices y nos vamos
¿Qué nosotros esperamos?
Si los dos nos gustamos 
Y las miradas no lo pueden negar

Farru!
Desde que te vi yo sabía
Que tú ibas a ser mía
Y algo a mí me decía
Que tú eres la baby que tanto quería…

Porque rápido hubo química 
Y te vi tan simpática 
Te miraba tan exótica 
Que rápido te jale pa’ca (briba, ba, ba, baiii)

Y gozamos, bebimos, fumamos
Bailamos to’a la noche y en casa terminamos
Todavía no sé cómo se llama
Y tampoco sé cómo terminamos en mi cama

Pero tuvimos química 
Y te vi tan simpática 
Te miraba tan exótica 
Que rápido te jale pa’ca (briba, ba, ba)

¿Qué tú harás si te digo?
Mis fantasías contigo
Susurrado al oído
Te comienzas a calentar…

Tú me dices y nos vamos
¿Qué nosotros esperamos?
Si los dos nos gustamos 
Y las miradas no lo pueden negar (uoo)

To’as las cosas que pasan por mi mente
En mi habitación, mujer…
Yo dándote
Que llegue el proceso de tu traje yo subir
Dame tus besos que son hechos para mí
Yo calentándote,
Tú calentándome,
Tú dices que tú eres brava, eso lo quiero ver…

Que llegue el proceso de tu traje yo subir
Dame tus besos que son hechos para mí
Sigue bailándome,
Sigue cucándome,
Que te voy a dar duro contra la pared

¿Cómo le puedo hacer?
Pa’ convencerte 
A solas quiero tenerte…

¿Qué tú harás si te digo?
Mis fantasías contigo
Susurrado al oído
Te comienzas a calentar…

Tú me dices y nos vamos
¿Qué nosotros esperamos?
Si los dos nos gustamos 
Y las miradas no lo pueden negar

Lyrics:

I’m sorry but
Don’t wanna talk
I need a moment before i go
It`s nothing personal

I draw the blinds
They don’t need to see me cry
Cause even when they understand
They don’t understand

So then when I’m finished
I’m all ‘bout my business
And ready to save the world
I’m takin my misery
Make it my bitch
Can’t be everyone’s favourite girl

So, take aim and fire away
I’ve never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way

Lo siento mucho, pero me voy
Por que a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy
Y me cansé de luchar y de guerrear en vano
De estar en la línea de fuego y de meter la mano
Acepto mis errores, también soy humano
Y tu no vez que lo Hago por que te amo

Pero ya, no tengo mas na' que hacer aquí
Me voy, llego la hora de partir
En mi propio camino seguiré lejos de ti

So, take aim and fire away
I’ve never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way

Letra de «Si Me Dices Que Sí»

(Lara mercy gang)
(For you my love)

Qué pasa si te digo 
Que yo no te he olvidado
Que no aprendí a vivir sin ti

(Reik)

Qué pasa si esta noche
Jugamos al pasado
Para curar la cicatriz

(Camilo)

¿Qué no daría por besar tu cuello?
¿Qué no daría por oler tu pelo
Mientras te me duermes en el pecho?
Daría todo por volver el tiempo

(Wo)
Es así
Si yo no tengo tus besos
Yo me puedo morir
(Wa yo, wa yey)
Si tú te alejas de mí
Ya no quiero vivir

Si desde lejos se nota 
Que ya no eres feliz
(Uh, oh)
Yo dejo todo por ti
Si me dices que sí

(¿A quién engañas?)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
(Lara mercy gang)

Si me dices que sí
(¿A quién engañas?)
(Wuo)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
(Farru)
Si me dices que sí

Tu boca se acuerda 
De mí si la toco
Mi mente no olvida 
Y mi cuerpo tampoco
Tú me enseñaste a amarte
Pero nunca a olvidarte

Dime qué voy a hacer 
Para que tú te quedes aquí
(Eh, eh)
(Dime qué hago)

Si no eres tú no es nadie
(Wu, oh, uh, oh)

Y es así
(Y es así)
Si yo no tengo tus besos
Yo me puedo morir
(Si no estás me muero)
Si tú te alejas de mí
Ya no quiero vivir
(Ya no quiero vivir)

Si desde lejos se nota 
Que ya no eres feliz
Yo dejo todo por ti
(Uh, oh)
Si me dices que sí

(¿A quién engañas?)
(Lara mercy gang)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)

Si me dices que sí
(¿A quién engañas?)
(Wuo)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
Si me dices que sí

Si me dices que sí

Te compro Richard Mille
Te regalo una casa ahí en Beverly Hills 
Pa’ vivi’no’ la movie flow Nicki MeekMilly
Como la serie del patrón somo’ El Topo y El Chili
Inseparables, cómplices apasionados en placer 
Si te lograra convencer 
Para que volvieras otra vez

Y dime que no
Lánzame un sí camuflajeado
Clávame una duda
Y me quedaré a tu lado

¿Qué no daría por oler tu pelo
Mientras te me duermes en el pecho?
Daría todo por volver el tiempo

(¡Farru!)

Y es así
Si yo no tengo tus besos
Yo me puedo morir
(Wai oh, wah yeh)
Si tú te alejas de mí
Ya no quiero vivir

Si desde lejos se nota 
Que ya no eres feliz
(Wuo)

Yo dejo todo por ti
Si me dices que sí

(¿A quién engañas?)
(Si me dices que sí)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)

Si me dices que sí
(Yeah)
(¿A quién engañas?)
(Wuo)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
Si me dices que sí

Qué no daría por besar tu cuello
Qué no daría por oler tu pelo
Mientras te me duermes en el pecho
Daría todo por volver el tiempo

Letra:

Sé
Que hay en tus ojos con solo mirar,
Que estás cansado de andar y de andar
Y caminar
Girando siempre en un lugar

Sé
Que las ventanas se pueden abrir,
Cambiar el aire depende de ti…
Te ayudará, Vale la pena una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda,
Quitarnos los miedo, dejarlos afuera…
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Vale más el presente que el futuro,
Dale suave que aquí no hay apuro
Ya salimos adelante, ya no le des mente
Y abrazo pa´ toda mi gente.

É melhor perder-se que nunca embarcar
Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
E assim será
E a vida muda, mudará.

Sé
Que en lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza algún día se irá y así será
La vida cambia y cambiará

Sentirás que el alma vuela
Por cantar una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, echarlos pa fuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro
con el corazón

Lyrics:
Adios madre mía
Échame la bendición
Perdón por esta agonia
Que causé a tu corazón
Dobla rodillas por mí
Rézale a dios por mí
Que tenga misericordia
Por la vida que escogí
En el barrio donde vivo
Me vinieron a buscar
Mamá, habla con el juez
Que me de la libertad
En el patio de la carcel
Hay un charco y no ha llovido
Son las lagrimas de un preso
Que ha entrado y no ha salido
Cuatro de la madrugada entran le rompen la puerta
A la vieja con una orden de arresto
Agentes enmascarados con el chaleco puesto
“Señora entregue a su hijo, ¿O prefiere verlo muerto?”
Mi madre confundida estalla en llanto
Pide misericordia en medio del quebranto
Yo nunca había visto a mami llorar
Pero aun así no paraba de rezar
Al verla así, mis manos levanté
No lo pensé y de una me entregué
Yo le gritaba “¡Madre perdóneme,
Esto no se lo merece usted!”
En el barrio donde vivo
Me vinieron a buscar
Mamá, habla con el juez
Que me de la libertad
En el patio de la carcel
Hay un charco y no ha llovido
Son las lagrimas de un preso
Que ha entrado y no ha salido
Yo tenía un mal presentimiento
De que algo mal iba a salir
Y antes de salir de casa
A mi viejita le pedí
Dobla rodillas por mí
Rézale a dios por mí
Que tenga misericordia
Por la vida que escogí
Salgo entregao’ puesto pa la vuelta
Si damo’ este palo me toca el 50
La cara tapá’ me enganché la 40
Por si algo sale mal le vacío el de 30
Toy viendo dimareo, una movida rara
Ya mate al contacto porque no nos da la cara
Detras viene una patrulla y si viene y nos para
“Mi libertad no tiene precio, dispara” Para-ra-ra-rapae!
Suenan los fules
Llegan los azules
Tabala tanta sangre no había visto
Si salimos vivos de aquí es gracias a Cristo
Por fin lo conseguimos a base de palos
De donde venimos nadie nos daba la mano
La cara tapada nos encapuchamos
Confío en el de arriba que nunca me ha traicionado
En mi coro no hay chivato’, yeh
Con Los Fedes no hicimos trato
En la calle tengo un contrato’ yeh
Siempre real y nunca sapo, nunca sapo Yeiyeeh
En el coro si hay un chivato
Que con Los Fedes hizo un trato
Por mi cabeza hay un contrato
No son real estos son sapo, estos son sapos
En el barrio donde vivo
Me vinieron a buscar
Mamá, habla con el juez
Que me de la libertad
En el patio de la carcel
Hay un charco y no ha llovido
Son las lagrimas de un preso
Que ha entrado y no ha salido

Lyrics:
Fuckin' Robitussin
I don't know why this shit got me lazy right now, yeah
Can't do Percocets or Molly (Molly)
I'm turnin' one, tryna live it up here right, right, right

Baby, you can
Ride it, ooh, yeah
Bring it over to my place
And you be like
""Baby, who cares?""
But I know you care
Bring it over to my place

You don't know what you did, did to me
Your body lightweight, speaks to me
I don't know what you did, did to me
Your body lightweight, speaks to me

Yeah
Yeah

I can make it hurricane on it
Hunnid bands, make it rain on it
Tie it up, put a chain on it
Make you tattoo my name on it, oh
Make you cry like a baby, yeah
Let's GoPro and make a video, yeah
Make you cry like a baby, yeah
Let's GoPro and make a video
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby, you can
Ride it, ooh, yeah
Bring it over to my place
And you be like
""Baby, who cares?""
But I know you care
Bring it over to my place

You don't know what you did, did to me
Your body lightweight, speaks to me
I don't know what you did, did to me
Your body lightweight, speaks to me

Lyrics:
El Rvssian

Aquella noche que volviste 
Llorando me Convenciste
Que tu no quería hacerme daño 
Hicimos el amor en el baño 

Tu mirada no es confiable
Como Tokyo inestable 
Sin importar el daño que has causado 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 

Malo malo pero malo 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 
Malo malo pero malo 
Estar cerca de ti pa mi eso es malo 
Pa mi eso es malo 

I’m tryna keep you warm
Quarentining with me for no reason 
Love drunk got me floored
Left your Chanel bag in my Porsche 
I shoulda dropped you off
Memories we repeat every weekend
Lie like this before
You do me when you get bored 
It ain’t no problem 
It’s cool what you doing tonight 
Long as you keep coming and I’m fucking you right
Lil mami amor
Another chance for me to give you what’s yours
And I know that it’s bad
When I let you pull me right back 
Cause you never promise tomorrow 
You give me your love but it’s borrowed 
Lay you down and forget all the past 
Only one that could do me like that 
How you coming and goin is tidal 
You wrapped on my body but I know

Malo malo pero malo 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 
Malo malo pero malo 
Estar cerca de ti pa mi eso es malo 

Baby se acabo 
Te corté de raíz ahora dónde ponerte decido yo 
Que se muera mi flor 
Difícil me la puso 
Acabo de ver en mi carro que su cartera se quedó
A propósito la dejó 
Siempre pone una excusa pa volverme a ver 
Después que peleamos me lo quiere hacer 
Con solo un beso se me olvidó 
Todo lo que ella me hizo 

Aquella noche que volviste 
Llorando me convenciste 
que tu no quería hacerme daño 
Hicimos el amor en el baño 
Tu mirada no es confiable 
Como Tokyo inestable 
Sin importar el daño que has causado 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 

Malo malo pero malo 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 
Malo malo pero malo 
Estar cerca de ti pa mi eso es malo 
Pa mi eso es malo

Lyrics:

I need you boo, (oh)
I gotta see you boo (hey)
And the heart's all over the world tonight,
Said the heart's all over the world tonight

Hey! Little mama,
Ooh, you're a stunner
Hot little figure,
Yes, you're a winner
And I'm so glad to be yours,
You're a class all your own
And
Oh, little cutie
When you talk to me
I swear the whole world stops
You're my sweetheart
And I'm so glad that you're mine
You are one of a kind and...

You mean to me
What I mean to you and
Together baby,
There is nothing we won't do.
'Cause if I got you,
I don't need money,
I don't need cars,
Girl, you're my all.
And...""

Lyrics: 
[Intro]
Yeah, word to Mazii, n*gga (ah)
F*ck these n*ggas talkin' 'bout, n*gga?
Haha
When they swing that way to the right, you swing to the left, you heard?

[Verse]
Woo, damn
I ain't been broke in a minute, don't get offended
Tore off the bow in a Bentley, f*cking your ho in her kidney
F*ck up the city, I do not dance, I jiggy
Gun is tucked under this Fendi
I like it, I spend it, I just came right out the jeweller
The ice on my neck and my wrist and my fist, I ain't finished
I was just workin' at Denny's, came back and counted some millions
I ain't no regular civillian
Red, yellow, green, look like my neck a chameleon
Ugh, okay, spin it, ugh
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I hit his b*tch, he offended
I'm in Givenchy and Fendi
They let me finish
I cut that Chevy for four day
My scammer bussing bottles off the '08
I cannot cuff, she's f*cking on my brozay
I'm just gon' f*ck her, treat her like a throwaway
Ooh, damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I'm at the mall out in Venice
I need it, swiping the digits
Calling up Kelz, he did 250 on biddie
It ain't no biggie, uh
Moncler kick it
F*cked that lil bih, made a viddie
She wanna leak it
She wanna send it
Ayy, f*ck that b*tch, my face wasn't in it
Damn, b*tch do scams on bitty
Bands in my hands look pretty
Hit another band on the 'gram, I'm litty
When I was broke, man, she fronted
But then I got rich and I hit it
Homie, I don't dance, I jiggy
Weed is so strong, I feel like I'm Popeye off the spinach
I cut the corner and bend it
B*tch, I'm a menace like Dennis
Don't sell me p*ssy, I need a percentage
If you gon' f*ck me, this shit is expensive
Nordstrom Rack, swipe my gift
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute, ayy (Woo, woo, woo)

[Outro]
I ain't been broke in a minute, damn (Woo)
I ain't been broke in a minute (Woo, woo, woo)
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute (Woo)
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute, damn

Lyrics: 

I'm not tryna be here for a long time
Just, just a good, good time
I got a lot of shit weighin' on my mind
Weighin' on my mind

So f*ckin' serious, you ni*gas' delirious
Said it wit' exclamation, but ni*gas can't f*ck wit' me, period
B*tch, right off the back, I need y'all to flex
All of this stuntin' look good for my ex
All of these zeros look good on my checks
I got like two or three phones for business and b*tches and still can't even answer a text
Yeah, we in the spot, we won't give it a rest
They be sayin' that that liquor gon' catch up to you
N*gga, it ain't caught up to me yet
I hit the road, I look like the mayor
Countin' up fifties and twentiеs and tens
I'm out of state, they givе me a ten
Ballin' again, again, again, again, again
Ballin' again, again, again, again, again
That was the plan again, b*tch, I'm the man again
Walk out of Louis, it look like a mannequin
All the store management wanna know how much I spend, I spend, yeah
I don't f*ck wit' her, she fiesty
All of the n*ggas that's wit' me are shiesty
This is the reason these n*ggas don't like me, yeah
I gotta win, I gotta hit from the back when it's pricy
I gotta fly out the trappers to sight-see
She wanna f*ck wit' a R&B singer
I hit her, I ducked her, I sent her to Nyce B
I'm on a roll like the motherf*ckin' dice be
I'm catchin' p*ssy like I'm Jerry Rice
I'm catchin' p*ssy like it was a flight
I'm in your city, what's up for the night?

I, I've had way too much to drink, you know, I
1942, it ain't on me, sing to five
Ex callin' up my phone, f*ckin' up the vibe
Tonight's not the night, tonight's not the—
Yeah (Yeah), f*ck that b*tch, yeah (Uh)
Hop on the couch, yeah (Yeah), take me a flick, yeah (Uh)
Louis V belt, yeah (Yeah), Louis V belt, yeah (Uh)
F*ck that b*tch, yeah (Yeah)
Hop on the couch, yeah (Yeah), take me a flick (Woah), yeah (Yeah)

Merry Christmas is the first Christmas album, and the fourth studio album, by Mariah Carey. The album features cover versions of popular Christmas tunes and original material. Carey worked with Walter Afanasieff, with whom she wrote all of the original tracks, as well as producing Carey's interpretations of the covered material. The album contains a contemporary holiday theme, and featured ""authentic, gospel flavored background vocals."" Three singles were released from the album, of which All I Want for Christmas Is You went on to become one of the best-selling singles of all time.

Lyrics:
Oh when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Oh baby I'm so into you
Darling if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming but I'm not sleeping

Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go
And now it's only fair
That I should let you know

Lyrics:
Oh, holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error, pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt it's worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees, oh, hear the Angels' voices
Oh, night divine, oh, night when Christ was born
Oh, night divine, oh, night, oh night divine

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees, oh, hear, hear the Angels' voices
Oh, night divine, yeah, oh, night when Christ was born
Oh, night divine, oh, night, oh night divine

Oh, night divine

Lyrics:

MUKHDA
Mujhko itna bataaye koi
Kaise tujh se dil no lagaaye koi

Rabba ne tujhko banaane mein
Kar di hain husn ki ख़ाली tijoriyaan
 
Kaajal ki 
Siyaahi se likhi 
Hain tu ne jaane
Kitnon ki love storiyaan 

[ Kesariya tera ishq hai piya
Rang jaaun jo main
Haath lagaaun
Din beete saara teri fikr mein
रैन saari teri खैर manaaun] x2

ANTARA
पतझड़ ke mausam mein bhi
रंगी chanaaron jaisi
Jhanke sannaaton mein tu
Veena (वीना) ke taaron jaisi

Sadiyon se bhi Iambi ye
Man ki amaavasein hain
Aur to phuljhadiyon vaale
Tyohaaron jaisi ..

Chanda bhi deevaana hai tera
Jalti hain tujhse
Saari chakoriyaan 

Kaajal ki
Siyaahi se likhi
Hain tu ne jaane
Kitnon ki love storiyaan

[Kesariya tera ishq hai piya
Rang jaaun jo main
Haath lagaaun
Din beete saara teri fikr mein
रैन saari teri खैर manaaun] x2

Shining in the sand in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and feel me, Ho Feel me 
Shining in the shed in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and heal me, O Heal me 

Thinking about the love n making The Life for sharing 
Come and feel me O feel me 
Shining in the sand in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and feel me, Come on Heal me.. 

Hua Jo tu bhi mera Mera, Tera Jo ikrarr hua 
To kyun na mein bhi, Keh dun keh dun 
Hua mujhe bhi Pyaar hua 
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon 
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon

Shining in the sand in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and feel me, O Feel me 
Shining in the shade in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and Heal me.. O Heal me.. 
umm waise to maan mera 
Phele bhi raaton mein 

Aksar hi chahat ke haan, Sapne Sanjota tha 
Phele bhi dhadkan yeh, Dhoonn koi gaati thi 
Par abb jo hota hai who, Phele na hota tha 
Hoona hai Tujhe jo bhi jo bhi 
Mujhe bhi is paar hua

To kyun na main bhi keh doon keh doon 
hoona mujhe bhi pyaar hua
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon 

Aankhon se chhoon lu k baahein tarasti hain 
Dil ne pukaara hai haan, Ab to Chale aao 
Aao k Shabnam ki Bundein Barasti hain 
Mausam Ishaara hai haan... 
Ab to Chale aao!!
Baahon mein Daale Baahein Baahein 
Baahon ka Jaise haar hoona.. 
Haan Maana maine maana maana... 
hoona mujhe bhi pyaar hoona 
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon 
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon 

Shining in the sand in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and feel me, Haan Feel me 
Shining in the sand in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and feel me, Haan Feel me 
Thinking about the love n making entire Life for sharing 
Come and feel me, Ho Heal me

Jeena mujhko raas aane laga
Jabse chehkeen batiyaan teri

Jogan tera maara rasiya
Jag jeeeta dil haara rasiya
Pag tere chaubaare thehre
Sadqe main banjaara rasiya

Rasiya ..
Ye tera hua tune jiya moh liya

Aaja mujhe seench de
Murjhaaya hun main

Jaise mera daaman hai tu
Aur teri chhaaya hun main

MALE
Tabhi tera baavra
Kehlaaya hun main

Teri baahon mein ho ke
Lagta hai ke zameen pe
Jannat sach mein agar kahin hai

FEMALE 
Yahin hai ..

Ban kar tera yaara rasiya
Soche naa dobaara rasiya

Pag tere chaubaare thehre
Sadqe main banjaara rasiya

It was released as a single in 1980 with ""Hey You"" as the B-side. The music was composed by guitarist David Gilmour, and lyrics were written by bassist Roger Waters.

The Wall is a concept album about an embittered and alienated rock star named Pink. In ""Comfortably Numb,"" Pink is medicated by a doctor so he can perform for a show.

Guitarist David Gilmour recorded a wordless demo, and bassist Roger Waters wrote lyrics, inspired by an experience of being injected with tranquilizers for stomach cramps before a 1977 performance in Philadelphia on the In the Flesh Tour. ""That was the longest two hours of my life,"" Waters said, ""trying to do a show when you can hardly lift your arm."" The song's working title was ""The Doctor"".

For the chorus, Gilmour and session player Lee Ritenour used a pair of acoustic guitars strung similarly to Nashville tuning, but with the low E string replaced with a high E string, two octaves higher than standard tuning. This tuning was also used for the arpeggios in ""Hey You"".

Waters and Gilmour disagreed about how to record the song; Gilmour preferred a more grungy style for the verses. Gilmour said: ""We argued over 'Comfortably Numb' like mad. Really had a big fight, went on for ages."" In the end, Waters' preferred opening and Gilmour's final solo were used.[citation needed]

To write the two guitar solos, Gilmour pieced together elements from several other solos he had been working on, marking his preferred segments for the final take.

**50TH ANNIVERSARY OF PINK FLOYD‘S ‘THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON’. OUT MARCH 24**
Announcing the release of Pink Floyd’s ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ as a deluxe box set to celebrate 50 years since the release of one of the best-selling albums of all time. Newly remastered, the box set will be released on 24th March 2023. 

One of the most iconic and influential albums ever, Pink Floyd’s ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ continues to find new audiences globally. The album was partly developed during live performances, and the band premiered an early version of the suite at London’s Rainbow Theatre several months before recording began. ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ is the eighth studio album by Pink Floyd, originally released in the US on 1 March and then in the UK on 16th March 1973.  The new material was recorded in 1972 and 1973 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road studios) in London. The iconic sleeve, which depicts a prism spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis and drawn by George Hardie. ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ has sold over 50 million copies worldwide.

The new deluxe box set includes CD and gatefold vinyl of the new 2023 remastered studio album and Blu-Ray + DVD audio featuring the original 5.1 mix and remastered stereo versions.  The set also includes additional new Blu-ray disc of Atmos mix plus CD and LP of ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon - Live At Wembley Empire Pool, London, 1974’. For full details see listing below.

**'THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON - LIVE AT WEMBLEY EMPIRE POOL, LONDON, 1974’**
Simultaneously, on 24th March, the CD and first ever vinyl issue of Pink Floyd’s ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon - Live At Wembley Empire Pool, London, 1974’ will be released independently. It was originally recorded in November 1974 as part of the band’s winter tour and this is the first time it will be available as a stand-alone album, with artwork featuring an original 1973 line-drawn cover by George Hardie.

**ANIMATED VIDEO COMPETITION**
The 50th Anniversary release will also be celebrated as Pink Floyd invite a new generation of animators to enter a competition to create music videos for any of the 10 songs on the iconic 1973 album. Pink Floyd has a rich history of collaborating with animators from the beginnings of the band (Ian Emes, Gerald Scarfe etc.), and in some cases the visuals that accompany the songs have become synonymous with the music itself. The 50th Anniversary will be no exception. The band would like to give all animators an opportunity to present a fresh take on these timeless aural works. Animators can enter up to 10 videos, one per song on the album. A winner will be selected from a panel of experts which will include Pink Floyd’s Nick Mason, Aubrey 'Po' Powell (Pink Floyd's creative director) and the BFI (British Film Institute). The deadline for submissions is November 30th 2023. To enter and for more information go to https://www.pinkfloyd.com/competition/

**PINK FLOYD - THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON: 50TH ANNIVERSARY BOOK**
The book Pink Floyd - The Dark Side Of The Moon: 50th Anniversary will also be published separately by Thames & Hudson on March 24, 2023 to coincide with the box set release. Curated by photographer Jill Furmanovsky and art directed by Hipgnosis co-founder Aubrey Powell, this LP-sized volume showcases rare and previously unseen photographs taken during The Dark Side Of The Moon tours of 1972-1975 and was created with the involvement of the band members.

**NEW PLANETARIUM ALBUM EXPERIENCE ANNOUNCED**
Fifty years on, in recognition of the iconic album and with the help of huge strides in technology, an official full dome experience with stunning visuals of the solar system and beyond and played out to 42 minutes of The Dark Side Of The Moon, will be released in Planetariums around the world in March. Contact your local Planetarium for any screening details.

The show itself will be divided between the 10 tracks off the album, in chronological order, each having a different theme; some futuristically looking forward and some a retro acknowledgment to Pink Floyd’s visual history, all relating to a time and space experience, embracing up to the minute technology that only a Planetarium can offer. It promises to be immersive; an all-encompassing surround sound and visual treat that will transcend reality and take you way beyond the realms of 2D experience.

OUT MARCH 24**

Announcing the release of Pink Floyd’s ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ as a deluxe box set to celebrate 50 years since the release of one of the best-selling albums of all time. Newly remastered, the box set will be released on 24th March 2023. 

One of the most iconic and influential albums ever, Pink Floyd’s ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ continues to find new audiences globally. The album was partly developed during live performances, and the band premiered an early version of the suite at London’s Rainbow Theatre several months before recording began. ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ is the eighth studio album by Pink Floyd, originally released in the US on 1 March and then in the UK on 16th March 1973.  The new material was recorded in 1972 and 1973 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road studios) in London. The iconic sleeve, which depicts a prism spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis and drawn by George Hardie. ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ has sold over 50 million copies worldwide.

The new deluxe box set includes CD and gatefold vinyl of the new 2023 remastered studio album and Blu-Ray + DVD audio featuring the original 5.1 mix and remastered stereo versions.  The set also includes additional new Blu-ray disc of Atmos mix plus CD and LP of ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon - Live At Wembley Empire Pool, London, 1974’. For full details see listing below.

**'THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON - LIVE AT WEMBLEY EMPIRE POOL, LONDON, 1974’**
Simultaneously, on 24th March, the CD and first ever vinyl issue of Pink Floyd’s ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon - Live At Wembley Empire Pool, London, 1974’ will be released independently. It was originally recorded in November 1974 as part of the band’s winter tour and this is the first time it will be available as a stand-alone album, with artwork featuring an original 1973 line-drawn cover by George Hardie.

**ANIMATED VIDEO COMPETITION**
The 50th Anniversary release will also be celebrated as Pink Floyd invite a new generation of animators to enter a competition to create music videos for any of the 10 songs on the iconic 1973 album. Pink Floyd has a rich history of collaborating with animators from the beginnings of the band (Ian Emes, Gerald Scarfe etc.), and in some cases the visuals that accompany the songs have become synonymous with the music itself. The 50th Anniversary will be no exception. The band would like to give all animators an opportunity to present a fresh take on these timeless aural works. Animators can enter up to 10 videos, one per song on the album. A winner will be selected from a panel of experts which will include Pink Floyd’s Nick Mason, Aubrey 'Po' Powell (Pink Floyd's creative director) and the BFI (British Film Institute). The deadline for submissions is November 30th 2023. To enter and for more information go to https://www.pinkfloyd.com/competition/

**PINK FLOYD - THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON: 50TH ANNIVERSARY BOOK**
The book Pink Floyd - The Dark Side Of The Moon: 50th Anniversary will also be published separately by Thames & Hudson on March 24, 2023 to coincide with the box set release. Curated by photographer Jill Furmanovsky and art directed by Hipgnosis co-founder Aubrey Powell, this LP-sized volume showcases rare and previously unseen photographs taken during The Dark Side Of The Moon tours of 1972-1975 and was created with the involvement of the band members.

**NEW PLANETARIUM ALBUM EXPERIENCE ANNOUNCED**
Fifty years on, in recognition of the iconic album and with the help of huge strides in technology, an official full dome experience with stunning visuals of the solar system and beyond and played out to 42 minutes of The Dark Side Of The Moon, will be released in Planetariums around the world in March. Contact your local Planetarium for any screening details.

The show itself will be divided between the 10 tracks off the album, in chronological order, each having a different theme; some futuristically looking forward and some a retro acknowledgment to Pink Floyd’s visual history, all relating to a time and space experience, embracing up to the minute technology that only a Planetarium can offer. It promises to be immersive; an all-encompassing surround sound and visual treat that will transcend reality and take you way beyond the realms of 2D experience.

But in a certain moment it turns out however we have missed the start of race and behind us there are lost years to which we can not get back.

Desperately, we're trying to make up for lost time; we race trying catch the sun. At the same time, we're aging, we're running out of breath and the moment of death is getting closer and closer.

The most loneliest day of my life
Such a lonely day

It's a day that I can't stand

The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life

Such a lonely day
Shouldn't exist
It's a day that I'll never miss
Such a lonely day
And it's mine
The most loneliest day of my life

And if you go
I wanna go with you
And if you die
I wanna die with you
Take your hand and walk away

The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life

Such a lonely day
And it's mine
It's a day that I'm glad I survived

Lyrics: 
Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

And I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Huh yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh)

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

Lyrics: 
Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new mania
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind-fuck America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Don't wanna be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's calling out to idiot America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

#GreenDay #Nimrod25 #GoodRiddanceTimeOfYourLife

Lyrics: 
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life...

Lyrics: 
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends...

Lyrics: 
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone, I walk a-

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Lyrics: 
Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around

Lyrics: 
Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Lyrics: 
Say hey!
Cha

Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery"" (Hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday!

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday!

Three, four!
""The representative from California has the floor.""
Sieg Heil to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass
And kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just ‘cause (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Just ‘cause (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Because we're outlaws, yeah!

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday

Lyrics: 
I'm having trouble trying to sleep
I'm counting sheep but running out
As time ticks by
still I try
No rest for crosstops in my mind
On my own... here we go

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own... here we go

My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughing in my face
A crooked spine
My senses dulled
Passed the point of delirium
On my own... here we go

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own... here we go

Jaded:

Somebody keep my balance
I think I'm falling off
Into a state of regression

The expiration date
Rapidly coming up
It's leaving me behind to rank

Always move forward
Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere

There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

I'm taking one step sideways
Leading with my crutch
Got a fucked up equilibrium

Count down from 9 to 5
Hooray! We're gonna die!
Blessed into our distinction

Always move forward
Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere

There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

Always move forward
Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere

There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
In nowhere
In nowhere

 Underwater, Einaudi's first full solo piano album for 20 years, is a manifesto for life and a statement for this time when the world around him was quiet and silent.

With 12 beautiful and intimate piano tracks featuring his trademark melodies, the album was written while Ludovico was isolated at his home in Italy, working without any distractions or the usual commitments that come with his busy schedule:

""I felt a sense of freedom to abandon myself and to let the music flow in a different way. I didn't have a filter between me and what came out of the piano, it felt very pure."" – Ludovico Einaudi

Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't want to miss a thing

LYRICS
I push my fingers into my eyes...
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache...
But it's made of all the things I have to take...
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside...
If the pain goes on...

I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited as my time's elapsed
Now, all I do is live with so much fate
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact:
You cannot kill what you did not create
I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on,
I'm not gonna make it!

Put me back together
Or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone
Tell me the reality is better than the dream
But I found out the hard way,
Nothing is what it seems!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside
If the pain goes on,
I'm not gonna make it!

All I've got...all I've got is insane...
All I've got...all I've got is insane...
All I've got...all I've got is insane!
All I've got...all I've got is insane!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside
If the pain goes on,
I'm not gonna make it!",True,True,525198814.0,nu metal

LYRICS
Stapled shut, inside an outside world 
And I'm sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home
I'm claustrophobic - closing in 
And I'm catastrophic, not again
I'm smeared across the page, and doused in gasoline
I wear you like a stain, yet I'm the one who's obscene
Catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections,
I've got no time to lose, and I'm just caught up in all the cattle

Fray the strings
Throw the shapes
Hold your breath
Listen!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

I'm ripped across the ditch, and settled in the dirt 
I wear you like a stitch, yet I'm the one who's hurt
Pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions
I've got no right to win, I'm just caught up in all the battles

Locked in clutch
Pushed in place
Hold your breath
Listen!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

My end
It justifies my means
All I ever do is delay
My every attempt to evade
The end of the road and my end
It justifies my means
All I ever do is delay
My every attempt to evade
THE END OF THE ROAD!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

LYRICS
I did my time and I want out
So effusive - fade - it doesn't cut
The soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion
Pseudo sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done! It has begun! I'm not the only one!

And the rain will kill us all...
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Psychosocial!

There are cracks in the road we laid
But where the temple fell
The secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had
Who needs another mess?
We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness
Venomous, insipid
I think we're done. I'm not the only one!

Psychosocial!

THE LIMITS OF THE DEAD!

Fake anti-fascist lie - (psychosocial!)
I tried to tell you but - (psychosocial!)
Your purple hearts are giving out - (psychosocial!)
Can't stop a killing idea - (psychosocial!)
If it's hunting season - (psychosocial!)
Is this what you want? - (psychosocial!)

LYRICS
I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander out where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 

Goodbye! 

I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time 
Everything is 3D blasphemy 
My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up 
This is not the way I pictured me 
I can't control my shakes 
How the hell did I get here? 
Something about this, so very wrong... 
I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this 
Is it a dream or a memory? 

I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander out where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 

Get outta my head cuz I don't need this 
Why I didn't I see this? 
I'm a victim - Manchurian candidate 
I have sinned by just 
Makin' my mind up and takin' your breath away 

I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander over where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 

Goodbye! 

You haven't learned a thing 
I haven't changed a thing 
My flesh was in my bones 
The pain was always free 

I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander out where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed...

Lyrics:

Oh, I’ll never kill myself to save my soul/I was gone but how was I to know?
I didn’t come this far to sink so low/I’m finally holding on to letting go
 
I’m just weathering a rough patch… another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the Hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it/Pick a Lord and you pray to it
You’re so demanding when you want the truth, but your stories don’t read for me
Oh, I’ll never kill myself to save my soul/I was gone but how was I to know?
I didn’t come this far to sink so low/I’m finally holding on to letting go
 
Indecision Overload/Keep a buckle on the Devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God, but did you Think- You’d- Shake- Your- Own?
This Killing Field is all grown over- the Motherfucker wants it wild
Go sew your oats in alphabetical order/the Anti-Antagonist is back- in- style
MYOPIC/Cannot See Straight/DYSTOPIC/One Sin Too Late
You got to lie if you want to believe, but your Bibles don’t work on me
Oh, I’ll never kill myself to save my soul/I was gone but how was I to know?
I didn’t come this far to sink so low/I’m finally holding on to letting… GO
 
Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I’m not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more- but you didn’t want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I’m setting you free- I’m setting you free
 
You’ve Killed The Saint In Me
How Dare You Martyr Me
You’ve Killed The Saint In Me
 
Oh, I’ll never kill myself to save my soul/I was gone but how was I to know?
I didn’t come this far to sink so low/I’m finally holding on to letting go

LYRICS
Undo these chains, my friend. I’ll show you the rage I’ve hidden.
Perish the Sacrament. Swallow, but nothing’s forgiven.
You and I can’t decide which of us was taken for granted.
Make amends… some of us are destined to be outlived.

STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil anymore

Under the words of men, something is tempting the father.
Where is your will, my friend? Insatiates never even bother.
You and I, wrong or right, traded a lie for the leverage.
In between the lens in light, you’re not what you seem.

STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil…
I’m Not Your Devil Anymore

Your Station- Is Abandoned- Fool You ‘cause I know what you’ve done
Sensation- Depravation- You should’ve burned when you turned on everyone

SO STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Oh, when all that’s left does not make sense
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
I know you’ll find your answers in the end
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil… anymore

LYRICS
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, 
And leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage 
For what resembles rage again...

So if you love me, let me go.
And run away before I know.
My heart is just too dark to care.
I can't destroy what isn't there.
Deliver me into my fate -
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you...
My smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

So save your breath, I will not care.
I think I made it very clear.
You couldn't hate enough to love.
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend.
Then I could hurt you in the end.
I never claimed to be a saint...
Ooh, my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away - you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control...
Ooh, my love was punished long ago

Lyrics:
Put Your Hands Into The Water- Let Your Mouth Go Sick And Dry
Put Your Life Into Your Death Now- Let Them Sing Until You Die
DIE!

Radical, rather than rhetorical, babble like an Oracle
Why am I always in your debt?
Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost- Communist Comatose
Show me all the wagers are a bet
The middle of a nuclear winter is a modern 
Achievement of the retro apocalyptic horde
Satan, you must be mistaken, there are no more Satans
Only The Bosses on the Board
Forget Deny Ignore Nice Try It’s You
Regret Rely Remorse Inside Of You

Maybe you’ve been down too long…

The Heart Begins To Suffer When The Soul Has Given Up
And The Flesh Is Barely More Than Bone
When No One Else Is Listening- Only When You’ve Had Enough
Time To Sing This Dying Song Alone
Put Your Hands Into The Water- Let Your Mouth Go Sick And Dry
Put Your Life Into Your Death Now- Let Them Sing Until You Die
DIE!

Maybe you’ve been down too long…

Think Hard You Bastards- You’re Gonna Tell Me Why
If I Don’t Get An Answer, You’re Gonna Sing and Die
Think Hard You Bastards- You’re Gonna Tell Me Why
If I Don’t Get An Answer, You’re Gonna Sing and Die

The Heart Begins To Suffer When The Soul Has Given Up
And The Flesh Is Barely More Than Bone
When No One Else Is Listening- Only When You’ve Had Enough
Time To Sing This Dying Song Alone

LYRICS
She seemed dressed in all of me, 
Stretched across my shame.
All the torment and the pain
Leaked through and covered me
I'd do anything to have her to myself
Just to have her for myself
Now I don't know what to do, 
I don't know what to do when she makes me sad.

She is everything to me
The unrequited dream
A song that no one sings
The unattainable, 
She's a myth that I have to believe in
All I need to make it real is one more reason
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do when she makes me sad.

But I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me

I catch in my throat choke
Torn into pieces
I won't, no!
I don't wanna be this...

But I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me

She isn't real
I can't make her real
She isn't real
I can't make her real",True,True,120556550.0,nu metal

Lyrics: 

Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you shoulda, somehow, realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

Back beat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you
By now you shoulda somehow realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me

Lyrics:

Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don`t you know you might find
A better place to play
You said that you`d once never been
All the things that you`ve seen
Will slowly fade away
 
So I start the revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
Step outside the summertime`s in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain`t ever gonna burn my heart out
 
So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we`re walking on by
Her soul slides away, but don`t look back in anger I hear you say
 
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it`s night or day
Please don`t put your life in the hands
Of a Rock n Roll band
Who`ll throw it all away
 
So I start the revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
Step outside the summertime`s in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain`t ever gonna burn my heart out
 
So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we`re walking on by
Her soul slides away, but don`t look back in anger I hear you say
 
Don`t look back in anger
Don`t look back in anger
Don`t look back in anger
At least not today

Lyrics: 

How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky
Wake up the dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the land slide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova
Cuz people believe that they`re
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world`s still spinning around
We don`t know why
Why why why why
How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky
Cuz people believe that they`re
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world`s still spinning around
We don`t know why
Why why why why
How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high

Lyrics:

Oh yeah

Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone?

Maybe I just wanna fly
Wanna live, I don't wanna die
Maybe I just wanna breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

I said maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone?

Maybe I will never be
All the things that I wanna be
Now is not the time to cry
Now's the time to find out why
I think you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone?

Maybe I just wanna fly
Wanna live, I don't wanna die
Maybe I just wanna breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

Gonna live forever
Gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
Gonna live forever
Gonna live forever

Lyrics:

I need to be myself
I can't be no one else
I'm feeling supersonic
Give me gin and tonic
You can have it all but how much do you want it?
You make me laugh
Give me your autograph
Can I ride with you in your B.M.W?
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine

You need to find out
'Cause no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you want to say
But before tomorrow

'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody could ever hear him call
Nobody could ever hear him call

You need to be yourself
You can't be no one else
I know a girl called Elsa
She's into Alka Seltzer
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train
And she makes me laugh
I've got her autograph
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter
She's sniffin in her tissue
Sellin' the Big Issue

When she finds out
No one's gonna tell her what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you wanna say
But before tomorrow

'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody could ever hear him call

Lyrics:

She's electric
She's in a family full of eccentrics
She's done things I never expected
And I need more time

She's got a sister
And God only knows how I've missed her
And on the palm of her hand is a blister
And I need more time

And I want you to know
I've got my mind made up now (mind made up now)
But I need more time
And I want you to say
""Do you know what I'm saying?"" (what I'm saying)
But I need more

'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
Lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?

She's got a brother
We don't get on with one another
But I quite fancy her mother
And I think that she likes me

She's got a cousin
In fact she's got 'bout a dozen
She's got one in the oven
But it's nothing to do with me

And I want you to know
I've got my mind made up now
But I need more time
And I want you to say
""Do you know what I'm saying?""
But I need more

'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
There's lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?

Can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?

'Stand By Me' Lyrics:

Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday
I've got a lot of things to learn
Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
Before my heart starts to burn

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know, the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Times are hard when things have got no meaning
I've found a key upon the floor
Maybe you and I will not believe in
The things we find behind the door

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know, the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows
Yeah, nobody knows the way it's gonna be

If you're leaving will you take me with you
I'm tired of talking on my phone
There is one thing I can never give you
My heart will never be your home

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know, the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows
Yeah, nobody knows the way it's gonna be

The way it's gonna be, yeah
Maybe I can see, yeah
Don't you know, the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows
Yeah, God only knows, the way it's gonna be

Lyrics:
Talking to the songbird yesterday
Flew me to a place not far away
She`s a little pilot in my mind
Singing songs of love to pass the time

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She`s not anyone

A man can never dream these kinds of things
Especially when she came and spread her wings
Whispered in my ear the things I`d like
Then she flew away into the night

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She`s not anyone",True,True,42404903.0,indie rock

Lyrics:
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back

I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black

Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you

If I look hard enough into the settin' sun
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I wanna see your face, painted black
Black as night, black as coal

I wanna see the sun flying high in the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black
Yeah!

Lyrics:

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination

I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm watchin' my TV
And that man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts can be
But he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me

I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm ridin' round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm signing that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl
Who tells me baby better come back later next week
Cause you see I'm on losing streak

I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no, I can't get no
I can't get no satisfaction
No satisfaction, no satisfaction, no satisfaction

Oh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Ooh, see the fire is sweepin'
Our very street today
Burns like a red coat carpet
Mad bull lost your way

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

The flood is threat'ning
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm gonna fade away

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

I tell you love, sister, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
Kiss away, kiss away

The Rolling Stones performing ""Sympathy For The Devil"" from The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus

Recorded before a live audience in London in 1968, The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus was originally conceived as a BBC-TV special. Directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, it centers on the original line up of The Rolling Stones -- Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman (with Nicky Hopkins and Rocky Dijon) -- who serves as both the show’s hosts and featured attraction. For the first time in front of an audience, “The World’s Greatest Rock and Roll Band” performs six Stones classics. The program also includes extraordinary performances by The Who, Jethro Tull, Taj Mahal, Marianne Faithfull, Yoko Ono, and The Dirty Mac. A ‘supergroup’ before the term had even been coined, the band was comprised of Eric Clapton (lead guitar), Keith Richards (bass), Mitch Mitchell of The Jimi Hendrix Experience (drums), and John Lennon on guitar and vocals.

Lyrics:
I watched you change
Into a fly
I looked away
You were on fire

And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

I took you home
Set you on the glass
I pulled off your wings
Then I laughed

And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

It's like you never had wings

I look at the cross
Then I look away
Give you the gun
Blow me away

And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

Now you feel alive
You feel alive
You feel alive
I've watched you change
It's like you never had wings

You've changed
You've changed
You've changed
Into a fly
