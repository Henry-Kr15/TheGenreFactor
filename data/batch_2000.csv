Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Yeah
The world is my expense
The cost of my desire
Jesus blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire
So raise your fists and march around
Just don't take what you need
I'll jail and bury those committed
And smother the rest in greed
Crawl with me into tomorrow
Or I'll drag you to your grave
I'm deep inside your children
They'll betray you in my name

[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire

[Verse 2]
The lie is my expense
The scope of my desire
The party blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire

[Pre-Chorus]
I am the Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer
The agents of orange, the priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire
Sleep now in the fire

[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire

[Verse 3]
For it's the end of history
It's caged and frozen still
There is no other pill to take
So swallow the one that makes you ill

[Pre-Chorus]
The Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer
The agents of orange, the priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire
Sleep now in the fire
Yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire

Lyrics:
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
We're the renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades
Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades

Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
Right down through the Middle Ages
Planet Earth kept going through changes
And then no renaissance came (Came)
And times continued to change (Change)
Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine
Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X
They were renegades of their time and age
So many renegades!

We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk

From a different solar system
Many, many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical mission, to help the others listen
And groove from land to land, singin' electronic chants like
Zulu Nation

Revelations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations

Now renegades are the people with their own philosophies
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
We're the renegades, we're the people with our own philosophies
We change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
Come on

We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

With Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin', sockin', rockin', puttin' a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin' and sockin' and rockin' and puttin' a side of hip-hop
'Cause we're poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop
Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of HIP-HOP!!

We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

We're teachers of the funk and not of empty popping
We're blessed with the force and the sight of electronics
With the bass, and the treble, the horns, and our vocals
'Cause every time I pop into the beat, we get fresh

[*drum break*]

Come on

[Guitar solo]

Come on

There was a time when our music
Was something called ""The Bay Street"" beat
People would gather from all around
To get down to the big sound
You had to be a renegade in those days
To take a man to the dance floor

Say jam sucka (Jam sucka)
Say jam sucka (Jam sucka)
Say groove sucka (Move sucka)
Now groove sucka (Move sucka)
Now dance sucka (Dance sucka)
Now dance sucka (Dance sucka)
Say move sucka (Move sucka)
Now move sucka (Move sucka)
Say jam sucka (Jam sucka)
Say jam sucka (Jam sucka)
Say groove sucka (Move sucka)
Now groove sucka (Move sucka)
Say dance sucka (Dance sucka)
Say dance sucka (Dance sucka)
Say move sucka (Move sucka)
Now move sucka (Move sucka)


We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Uhh
Ayy, yo, it's just another bombtrack, uh
Ayy, yo, it's just another bombtrack, yeah
It goes a one, two, three
Yeah, and it's just another bombtrack

[Verse 1]
And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
But I'ma drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beatdowns
Could run a train on punk fools that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

[Pre-Chorus]
With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn (Yes, you're gonna)
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

[Verse 2]
It goes a one, two, three, another funky, radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere

[Pre-Chorus]
With the thoughts from a militant, militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn (Yes, you're gonna)
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

Hey, yo, it's just another bombtrack

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Uh

[Verse 1]
The movie ran through me
The glamour subdue me
The tabloid untied me
I'm empty. please fill me
Mister Anchor, assure me
That Baghdad is burning
Your voice, it is so soothing
That cunning mantra of killing
I need you, my witness
To dress this up so bloodless
To numb me and purge me now
Of thoughts of blaming you
Yes, the car is our wheelchair
My witness, your coughing
Oily silence mocks the legless ones
Who travel now in coffins

[Pre-Chorus]
While on the corner (Corner)
The jury's sleepless (Sleepless)
We found your weakness (Weakness)
And it's right outside your door

[Chorus]
Now testify
Now testify
It's right outside your door, now testify
Yes, testify
It's right outside your door

[Verse 2]
With precision you feed me
My witness, I'm hungry
Your temple, it calms me, so I can carry on
My slaving, sweating the skin right off my bones
On a bed of fire, I'm choking on the smoke that fills my home
The wrecking ball is rushing
Witness your blushing
The pipeline is gushing
While here we lie in tombs

[Pre-Chorus]
While on the corner (Corner)
The jury's sleepless (Sleepless)
We found your weakness (Weakness)
And it's right outside your door

[Chorus]
Now testify
Yeah, testify
It's right outside your door
Now testify
Now testify
And it's right outside your door


[Post-Chorus]
Mass graves for the pump when the price is set
When the price is set
Mass graves for the pump when the price is set
When the price is set
Mass graves for the pump when the price is set
When the price is set
Mass graves for the pump when the price is set
When the price is set

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]

[Intro: Zack De La Rocha]
Huh
Yeah, we're comin' back in with another bombtrack
Think ya know it's all of that, huh
Ayo, so check this out, yeah
 
[Chorus: Zack De La Rocha]
Know your enemy
Come on
 
[Verse 1: Zack De La Rocha]
Born with insight and a raised fist
A witness to the slit wrist
As we move into '92
Still in a room without a view
Ya got to know, ya got to know
That when I say go, go, go
Amp up and amplify, defy
I'm a brother with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in
Something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Fist in ya face in the place and I'll drop the style clearly
Know your enemy

[Chorus: Zack De La Rocha]
Know your enemy
Yeah
Ayo, get with this, ugh
 
[Verse 2: Zack De La Rocha]
Word is born
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Now I got no patience
So sick of complacence
With the D, the E, the F, the I, the A, the N, the C, the E
Mind of a revolutionary, so clear the lane
The finger to the land of the chains
What? The ""land of the free""?
Whoever told you that is your enemy
Now something must be done
About vengeance, a badge, and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Now action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in
 
[Bridge: Maynard James Keenan]
I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
Sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of you
Time has come to pay
[Chorus: Zack De La Rocha]
Know your enemy
 
[Guitar Solo]
 
[Outro: Zack De La Rocha]
Come on
Yes, I know my enemies
They're the teachers who taught me to fight me
Compromise, conformity
Assimilation, submission
Ignorance, hypocrisy
Brutality, the elite
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Come on
Ugh
Come on
 
[Verse 1]
Although ya try to discredit, ya still never read it
The needle, I'll thread it, radically poetic
Standin' with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double ""I'm Mad"", still knee deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose but it'll never come close
To the rage built up inside of me
Fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy
Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak, movements cease when their heads are flown
'Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police, (What!) the judges (What!), the feds
Networks at work, keeping people calm
You know they went after King when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot
 
[Interlude]
Yeah
Yeah, back in this
 
[Verse 2]
With poetry my mind I flex
""Flip"" like Wilson, vocals never lackin' that finesse
What do I got to, what do I got to do to wake you up?
To shake you up, to break the structure up?
'Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like taking photos, mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove, then stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the ""Stutter Step"" then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yeah, several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream and put it to an end
You better beware of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X and tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot
 
[Bridge]
What was the price on his head?
What was the price on his head!?
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard
I think I heard a shot
 
[Interlude]
""Black Nationalism... [...]
[He] may be a brave contender for this position
But should he abandon his supposed 'obedience'
To the 'White liberal doctrine' of non-violence
And embrace Black Nationalism""
Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them
Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them
And neutralize them, and neutralize them
And neutralize them, and neutralize them
And neutralize them""
 
[Chorus]
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
 
[Outro]
How long? Not long
'Cause what you reap is what you sow

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Yeah, people come up
Yeah, we better turn the bass up on this one

[Verse 1]
Check it, since fifteen hundred and sixteen, Mayans attacked and overseen
Now crawl amidst the ruins of this empty dream
With their borders and boots on top of us
Pullin' knobs on the floor of their toxic metropolis
But how you gonna get what you need to get?
The gut eaters, blood drenched get offensive like Tet
The fifth sun sets get back reclaim
The spirit of Cuauhtémoc, alive and untamed
Now face the funk now blastin' out your speaker
On the one, Maya, Mexica
That vulture came to try and steal your name but now you got a gun
Yeah, this is for the people of the sun

[Chorus]
It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around again
It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around again

[Verse 2]
Yeah, never forget that the whip snapped ya back
Your spine cracked for tobacc-oh, I'm the Marlboro Man, uh
Our past blastin' on through the verses
Brigades of taxi cabs rollin' Broadway like hearses
Troops strippin' zoots, shots of red mist
Sailors' blood on the deck, come sister, resist
From the era of terror, check this photo lens
Now the City of Angels does the ethnic cleanse, uh
Heads bobbin' to the funk out your speaker
On the one, Maya, Mexica
That vulture came to try and steal your name but now you found a gun
You're history
This is for the people of the sun

[Chorus]
It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around again, yeah
It's comin' back around again

Lyrics:
I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

And the message coming from my eyes
Says ""Leave it alone""

Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

And the feeling coming from my bones
Says ""Find a home""

I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will sing no more

And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me ""Go back home""

Lyrics:
Fell in love with a girl
I fell in love once and almost completely
She's in love with the world
But sometimes, these feelings can be so misleading
She turns and says, ""Are you alright?""
I said, ""I must be fine 'cause my heart's still beating.""
""Come and kiss me by the riverside, yeah
Bobby says it's fine, he don't consider it cheating, now.""

Red hair with a curl
Mello-Roll for the flavor, and the eyes were peeping
Can't keep away from the girl
These two sides of my brain need to have a meeting
Can't think of anything to do, yeah
My left brain knows that all love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new, yeah
I said it once before, but it bears repeating now

Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Can't think of anything to do, yeah
My left brain knows that all love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new
Well, I said it once before, but it bears repeating now

Lyrics:
You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid turned it blue

Something better than nothing
Something better than nothing, it's giving up
We all need to do something
Try to keep the truth from showing up

How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?
How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?
How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?

You're given a flower
But I guess that there's just no pleasing you
Your lip tastes sour
But you think that it's just me teasing you

You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid turned it blue

Get behind me
Get behind me now, anyway
Get behind me
Get behind me now, anyway
Get behind me
Get behind me now, anyway

You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid turned it blue

Lyrics:
Fall is here, hear the yell
Back to school, ring the bell
Brand new shoes, walking blues
Climb the fence, books and pens
I can tell that we are going to be friends
I can tell that we are going to be friends

Walk with me, Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We will rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we found
Safely walk to school without a sound
Safely walk to school without a sound

Here we are, no one else
We walk to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn

Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns, and books, and show and tell
Playtime, we will throw the ball
Back to class, through the hall
Teacher marks our height against the wall
Teacher marks our height against the wall
 
And we don't notice any time pass
We don't notice anything
We sit side by side in every class
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes the way you sing

Tonight I'll dream, while I’m in bed
When silly thoughts go through my head
About the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow, I'll bet
That you and I will walk together again

I can tell that we are going to be friends
Yes, I can tell that we are going to be friends

Lyrics:
Ah, icky thump
Who'da thunk?
Sitting drunk on a wagon to Mexico
Ahh well
What a chump
Well my head got a bump
When I hit it on the radio
Redhead señorita
Looking dead
Came and said
Need a bed
In Español
I said
Gimme a drink of water
I'm gonna sing around the collar
And I don't need a microphone

Icky Thump
With a lump in my throat
Grabbed my coat
And I was freaking
I was ready to go!
And I swear
Besides the hair
She had one white eye
One blank stare
Looking up
Lying there
On the stand
Near her hand
Was a candy cane
Black rum, sugar cane
Dry ice and something strange
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
 
White Americans, what
Nothing better to do
Why don't you kick yourself out
You're an immigrant too
Who's using who
What should we do?
Well, you can't be a pimp
And a prostitute too
Icky thump
Handcuffed to a bunk
Robbed blind
Looked around
And there was nobody else
Left alone
I hit myself with a stone
Went home and learned how
To clean up after myself

Lyrics:
I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette
 
And the message coming from my eyes
Says ""Leave it alone""
 
Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do
 
And the feeling coming from my bones
Says ""Find a home""
 
I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will sing no more
 
And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me ""Go back home""",True,True,34019784.0,garage rock

Lyrics:
We started living in an old house
My ma gave birth and we were checking it out
It was a baby boy, so we bought him a toy
It was a ray gun, and it was 1981

We named him 'Baby', he had a toothache
He started crying, it sounded like an earthquake
It didn't last long, because I stopped it
I grabbed a rag doll and stuck some little pins in it

Now we're a family, and we're alright now
We got money, and a little place to fight now
We don't know you, and we don't owe you
But if you see us around, I got something else to show you

[Instrumental Break]

Now it's easy when you don't know better
You think it's sleazy? Then put it in a short letter
We keep warm, but there's just something wrong with you
Just feel that you're the hardest little button to button

I had opinions that didn't matter
I had a brain that felt like pancake batter
I got a backyard with nothing in it
Except a stick, a dog, and a box with something in it

The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
Uh-oh
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
Uh-oh
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button

[Instrumental Break]

The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
Uh-oh

Lyrics:
If you think that a kiss is all in the lips
C'mon, you got it all wrong, man
And if you think that our dance was all in the hips
Oh well, then do the twist
If you think holding hands is all in the fingers
Grab hold of the soul where the memory lingers and
Make sure to never do it with the singer
Cause he'll tell everyone in the world
What he was thinking about the girl
Yeah, what he's thinking about the girl, oh

A lot of people get confused and they bruise
Real easy when it comes to love
They start putting on their shoes and walking out
And singing ""boy, I think I had enough""
Just because she makes a big rumpus
She don't mean to be mean or hurt you on purpose, boy
Take a tip and do yourself a little service
Take a mountain turn it into a mole
Just by playing a different role
Yeah, by playing a different role, oh

The boat, yeah, you know she's rockin' it
And the truth well ya know there's no stoppin' it
The boat, yeah, you know she's still rockin' it
The truth well you know there's no stoppin' it
 
So what, somebody left you in a rut
And wants to be the one who's in control
But the feeling that you're under can really make you wonder
How the hell she can be so cold
So now you're mad, denying the truth
And it's hidden in the wisdom in the back of your tooth
Ya need ta spit it out, in a telephone booth
While ya call everyone that you know, and ask 'em
Where do you think she goes
Oh yeah, where d'ya suppose she goes, oh

The truth well you know there's no stoppin' it
And the boat well yeah know she's still rockin' it
The boat well you know she's still rockin' it
And the truth, yeah you know there's no stoppin' it

You recognize the effect and the wreck
That it’s causin' when she rocks the boat
But it’s the clause hidden in the Cardinal Laws
'bout the proper place to hang her coat
So to you, the truth is still hidden
And the soul plays the role of a lost little kitten but
You should know that the doctors weren't kiddin?
She's been singing it all along
But you were hearin' a different song
Yeah you were hearin' a different song
But you were hearin' a different song

Lyrics:
Dead leaves and the dirty ground
When I know you're not around
Shiny tops and soda pops
When I hear your lips make a sound
When I hear your lips make a sound
Thirty notes in the mailbox
Will tell you that I'm coming home
And I think I'm gonna stick around
For a while so you're not alone
For a while so you're not alone

If you can hear a piano fall
You can hear me coming down the hall
If I could just hear your pretty voice
I don't think I'd need to see at all
Don't think I'd need to see at all
Soft hair and a velvet tongue
I want to give you what you give to me
And every breath that is in your lungs
Is a tiny little gift to me
Is a tiny little gift to me

I didn't feel so bad 'til the sun went down
Then I come home
No one to wrap my arms around
Wrap my arms around

Well, any man with a microphone
Can tell you what he loves the most
And you know why you love at all
If you're thinking of the holy ghost
If you're thinking of the holy ghost

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Hey, little apple blossom
What seems to be the problem?
All the ones you tell your troubles to
They don't really care for you
Come and tell me what you're thinking
'Cause just when the boat is sinking
A little light is blinking
And I will come and rescue you
 
[Chorus]
Lots of girls walk around in tears
But that's not for you
You've been looking all around for years
For someone to tell your troubles to
 
[Verse 2]
Come and sit with me and talk awhile
Let me see your pretty little smile
Put your troubles in a little pile
And I will sort 'em out for you
 
[Chorus]
Lots of girls walk around in tears
But that's not for you
You've been looking all around for years
For someone to tell your troubles to
 
[Verse 3]
Come and sit with me and talk awhile
Let me see your pretty little smile
Put your troubles in a little pile
And I will sort them out for you

Summary: 
After years of life on the road and with their role models, the Allman Brothers Band, struggling to survive the deaths of two of its most distinctively talented members, today Lynyrd Skynyrd has become the quintessential Southern Rock band. Under the leadership of frontman and primary songwriter Ronnie Van Zant, the group's melodic lyric driven ballads and power driven hard rockers would catapult the group into one of the most popular touring bands in the world. The group's distinctive guitar attack, combined with an overtly defiant and rebellious attitude, gave them a cultural identity that would help make songs like ""Sweet Home Alabama"" and ""Free Bird"" into anthems of American rock music and staples of FM radio right up to the present day.

Headlining a bill that also featured the Outlaws, this Winterland recording captures Lynyrd Skynyrd following the release of their fourth album, Gimme Back My Bullets. This was during a transitional phase for the band, following the departure of guitarist Ed King, but prior to his replacement, Steve Gaines, coming on board. The band was carrying on as a six-piece unit, augmented by the Honkettes on backing vocals.  

This is an interesting time to hear the band live, as their trademark three-guitar attack was reduced by one guitar, leaving more room for keyboardist Billy Powell. On the ballads, like ""Tuesdays Gone"" and the pre-jam verses of ""Freebird,"" Powell displays great creativity and expands the keyboard's role in these songs.

Otherwise, the band rocks as hard as ever, with a good selection of their most popular songs, sampling a bit from all four of their studio albums. The group's defiant Southern swagger, combined with an infectious guitar and piano driven groove, creates an irresistible combination that resonated far beyond the Southern states. Two of the standouts on this show are both well chosen covers, which the band redefines as their own; J.J. Cale's ""Call Me The Breeze"" and Jimmy Rogers' ""T For Texas."" Both of these are rearranged in classic Skynyrd style, with the latter closing the set and clearly displaying the root sound of the band at its best.  

The audience demands an encore and the band obliges with a monumental ""Free Bird."" It begins as a plaintive slow ballad, with Van Zant's distinctively sad vocals over the melodic keyboard playing of Powell and delicate slide guitar ornamentation from Rossington. However, it is the second section, which becomes an up-tempo guitar boogie, that really hits home. Here the guitarists cut loose to create one of the most distinctive solos of all time. Rossington and Collins turn this section into a soaring jam that also features impressive melodic bass playing from Wilkeson and furious keyboards from Powell. Following a brief reprise of the song, they turn on a dime back into the groove of the jam before bringing it to a climactic close. 

""Free Bird,"" more often than not, sarcastically, would become the most requested song of all time. For musicians, this inevitable request has become so tiresome, that the act of requesting it has become universally known as ""the mantra of the moron."" Still, this only goes to prove just how deeply this song has permeated American culture and is a testament to its enduring popularity, making it one of the true landmark rock songs of twentieth century music.",True,True,103002999.0,Southern rock

Lyrics
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad
it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
my head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
and even if I'm there, they'll all imply that I might not last the
day
and then you call me and it's not so bad
it's not so bad and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and
through
then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
and even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue
because you're near me and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life 

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life",True,True,274516382.0,trip hop

Lyrics
I know you think that I shouldn't still love you,
Or tell you that.
But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it
Where's the sense in that?

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

But I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and destruction
To come back again
And I caused nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again

And if you live by the rules of ""it's over""
Then I'm sure that that makes sense

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was there
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on....

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be",True,True,263108282.0,Not Found

Lyrics
I didn't hear you leave
I wonder how am I still here
And I don't want to move a thing 
It might change my memory

Oh I am what I am 
I'll do what I want 
But I can't hide
I won't go 
I won't sleep 
I can't breathe 
Until you're resting here with me
I won't leave 
I can't hide 
I cannot be 
Until you're resting here with me

I don't want to call my friends 
They might wake me from this dream
And I can't leave this bed
Risk forgetting all that's been

Oh I am what I am 
I'll do what I want 
But I can't hide
I won't go 
I won't sleep 
I can't breathe

Lyrics
I haven't ever really found a place that I call home
I never stick around quite long enough to make it
I apologize once again I'm not in love
But it's not as if I mind
that your heart ain't exactly breaking

It's just a thought, only a thought

But if my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy
Well I deserve nothing more than I get
Cos nothing I have is truly mine

I've always thought
that I would love to live by the sea
To travel the world alone
and live more simply
I have no idea what's happened to that dream
Cos there's really nothing left here to stop me

It's just a thought, only a thought

But if my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy
Well I deserve nothing more than I get
Cos nothing I have is truly mine

If my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy
Well I deserve nothing more than I get
Cos nothing I have is truly mine

While my heart is a shield and I won't let it down
While I am so afraid to fail so I won't even try
Well how can I say I'm alive

If my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy
Well I deserve nothing more than I get
Cos nothing I have is truly mine

If my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy
Well I deserve nothing more than I get
Cos nothing I have is truly mine
Cos nothing I have is truly mine
Cos nothing I have is truly mine
Cos nothing I have is truly mine",True,True,63474600.0,Not Found

Lyrics
With one light on in one room
I know you're up when I get home
With one small step upon the stair
I know your look when I get there
If you were a king up there on your throne
would you be wise enough to let me go
for this queen you think you own
Wants to be a hunter again
wants to see the world alone again
to take a chance on life again
so let me go

The unread book and painful look
the tv's on, the sound is down
One long pause
then you begin
oh look what the cat's brought in
If you were a king up there on your throne
would you be wise enough to let me go
for this queen you think you own
Wants to be a hunter again
wants to see the world alone again
to take a chance on life again
so let me go
let me leave

For the crown you've placed upon my head feels too heavy now
and I don't know what to say to you but I'll smile anyhow
and all the time I'm thinking, thinking

I want to be a hunter again
want to see the world alone again
to take a chance on life again
so let me go.",True,True,27675139.0,trip hop

Please don't think of getting up for me
You don't even need to speak
When I've been here for just one day
You'll already miss me if I go away
So close the blinds and shut the door
You won't need other friends anymore

Oh don't leave home, oh don't leave home

If you're cold I'll keep you warm
If you're low just hold on
Cause I will be your safety
Oh don't leave home

I arrived when you were weak
I'll make you weaker, like a child
Now all your love you give to me

When your heart is all I need

Oh don't leave home, oh don't leave home

If you're cold I'll keep you warm
If you're low just hold on
Cause I will be your safety
Oh don't leave home

Oh how quiet, quiet the world can be
When it's just you and little me
Everything is clear and everything is new
So you won't be leaving will you

Oh don't leave home, oh don't leave home

If you're cold I'll keep you warm
If you're low just hold on
Cause I will be your safety
Oh don't leave home",True,True,14744209.0,Not Found

Lyrics
Take it by your silence
That I'm free to walk out the door
By the look in your eyes I can tell
You don't think I'll be back for more

Try to think of the world
Where you could stay and these safe hands could go
Take your heart above the water
Wherever I choose to go

No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love

Even when you don't see me
Even when you don't hear
I'll be flying low below the sun
And you'll feel it all out here

No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love

No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love

Standing here in silence
The world in front of me
Holding you in my hand
And seeing as you'd see

No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love
No freedom without love

Lyrics:
It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, ""Do I look all right?""
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight""

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me ""Do you feel all right?""
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, ""My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight""

Lyrics:
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy

All around in my home town
They're trying to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy
But I say

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy

Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what I don't know
Every time that I plant a seed
He said, ""Kill it before it grows""
He said, ""Kill it before it grows""
I say

I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offense

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town
All of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I, so I had to shoot him down
I say

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy

Reflexes got the better of me
And what will be, will be
Every day the bucket goes to the well
But one day the bottom will drop out
Yes, one day the bottom will drop out
But I say

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy

Lyrics:
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, 'n' how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Yes, 'n' how many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the sea?
Yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, 'n' how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Yes, 'n' how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

Lyrics:
If you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin' winds
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
For that's the way I remember her best
I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day
So, if you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Lyrics:
Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, ""My God, they killed them all!""
Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
""I didn't do it, "" he says, and he throws up his hands
""I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand
I saw them leavin', "" he says, and he stops
""One of us had better call up the cops.""
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you want to draw the heat
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, ""I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates.""
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead""
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men
Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
Says, ""Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!""
Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame
""Remember that murder that happened in a bar?""
""Remember you said you saw the getaway car?""
""You think you'd like to play ball with the law?""
""Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?""
""Don't forget that you are white.""
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, ""I'm really not sure.""
Cops said, ""A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
You'll be doin' society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim.""

Lyrics:
Come gather 'round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone.
If your time to you
Is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'.
Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who
That it's namin'.
For the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'.
Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There's a battle outside
And it is ragin'.
It'll soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'.
Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is
Rapidly agin'.
Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'.
The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is
Rapidly fadin'.
And the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'.

Lyrics:
Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
Ifin' you don't know by now
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do some how
When your rooster crows at the break a dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
Don't think twice, it's all right
And it ain't no use in a-turnin' on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right
No it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
I can't hear ya any more
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' wallkin' way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I am told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right
So long honey babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye is too good a word, babe
So I just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right

Lyrics:
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
My senses have been stripped
My hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone
It's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time
It's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time
Far past the frozen leaves
The haunted frightened trees
Out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
With one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea
Circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate
Driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I’ll show them to you and you’ll see them shine

[Verse 2]
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day, let me see ya' make him smile
His clothes are dirty but his, his hands are clean
And you’re the best thing that he’s ever seen

[Verse 3]
Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he’s standing in front of you

[Verse 4]
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay
Stay while the night is still ahead
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night
Stay, lady, stay
Stay while the night is still ahead

Lyrics:
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on an uneventful morn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation and she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence I got repaid with scorn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

'My friends feel it's their appointed duty
They keep trying to tell me
All you want to do is use me
But my answer, yeah to all that use me stuff
I want to spread the news
That if it feels this good getting used
You just keep on using me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up

My brother sit me right down and he talked to me
He told me that I ought not to let you just walk on me
And I'm sure he meant well
Yeah, but when our talk was through
I said, brother, if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep on using me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up

Sometimes, it's true
You really do abuse me
You get me in a crowd of high-class people
And then you act real rude to me
But, oh baby, baby, baby, baby
When you love me, I can't get enough
I want to spread the news
That if it feels this good getting used
Girl, you just keep on using me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Talkin' 'bout you usin' people
It all depends on what you do
It ain't too bad the way you're usin' me
Cause I sure am usin' you to do the things you do'

Lyrics:
Grandma's hands clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands played a tambourine so well
Grandma's hands used to issue out a warning
She'd say, ""Billy don't you run so fast
Might fall on a piece of glass
Might be snakes there in that grass,""
Grandma's hands

Grandma's hands sooth the local unwed mother
Grandma's hands used to ache sometimes and swell
Grandma's hands used to lift her face and tell her
She'd say, ""Baby Grandma understands
That you really loved that man
Put yourself in Jesus' hands.""
Grandma's Hands

Grandma's hands used to hand me piece of candy
Grandma's hands picked me up each time I fell
Grandma's hands, boy they really came in handy
She'd say, "" Mattie don't you whip that boy
What you want to spank him for?
He didn't drop no apple core,""
But I don't have Grandma anymore
If I get to heaven I'll look for
Grandma's hands

Lyrics:
A man we passed just tried to stare me down
And when I looked at you
You looked at the ground
I don't know who he is but I think that you do
Dad-gum-it! Who is he, and what is he to you?

Something in my heart and in your eye
Tells me he's not someone just passing by
And when you cleared your throat
Was that your cue?
Dad-gum-it!
Who is he, and what is he to you?

When I add the sum of you and me
I get confused and keep coming up with three
You're too much for one man but not enough for two
Dad-gum-it! Who is he, and what is he to you?

You tell me men don’t have much intuition
Is that what you really think or are you wishin’?
Before you wreck your old home be certain of the new

""Only Time"" Lyrics:

Who can say where the road goes
Where the day flows, only time
And who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose, only time

Who can say why your heart sighs
As your love flies, only time
And who can say why your heart cries
When your love lies, only time

Who can say when the roads meet
That love might be in your heart
And who can say when the day sleeps
If the night keeps all your heart
Night keeps all your heart

Who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose
- Only time
And who can say where the road goes
Where the day flows, only time

Who knows? Only time

So the world goes round and round
With all you ever knew
They say the sky high above
Is Caribbean blue...

If every man says all he can
If every man is true
Do I believe the sky above
Is Caribbean blue...

... Boreas...
... Zephyrus...

If all they told was turned to gold
If all you dreamed was new
Imagine the sky high above
In Caribbean blue...

Lyrics:
Let me sail, let me sail, let the Orinoco flow
Let me reach, let me beach on the shores of Tripoli
Let me sail, let me sail, let me crash upon your shore
Let me reach, let me beach far beyond the Yellow Sea
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
From Bissau to Palau in the shade of Avalon
From Fiji to Tiree and the isles of Ebony
From Peru to Cebu, feel the power of Babylon
From Bali to Cali, far beneath the Coral Sea
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
From the North to the South, Ebudau unto Khartoum
From the deep sea of clouds to the island of the Moon
Carry me on the waves to the land I've never been
Carry me on the waves to the land I've never seen
We can sail, we can sail with the Orinoco flow
We can sail, we can sail
Sail away, sail away, sail away
We can steer, we can near with Rob Dickins at the wheel
We can sigh, say goodbye, Ross and his dependencies
We can sail, we can sail
Sail away, sail away, sail away
We can sail, we can sail
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away

Lyrics:
Ever close your eyes
Ever stop and listen
Ever feel alive
And you've nothing missing
You don't need a reason
Let the day go on and on
Let the rain fall down
Everywhere around you
Give into it now
Let the day surround you
You don't need a reason
Let the rain go on and on
What a day
What a day to take to
What a way
What a way
To make it through
What a day
What a day to take to
A wild child
Only take the time
From the helter skelter
Every day you find
Everything's in kilter
You don't need a reason
Let the day go on and on
Every summer sun
Every winter evening
Every spring to come
Every autumn leaving
You don't need a reason
Let it all go on and on
What a day
What a day to take to
What a way
What a way
To make it through
What a day
What a day to take to
A wild child
What a day
What a day to take to
What a way
What a way
To make it through
What a day
What a day to take to

What a day to take to

Lyrics:
You know when you give your love away
It opens your heart,
Everything is new.
And you know time will always find a way
To let your heart believe it's true.

You know love is everything you say;
A whisper, a word,
Promises you give.
You feel it in the heartbeat of the day.
You know this is the way love is.

[Chorus:]
Amarantine...
Amarantine...
Amarantine...
Love is.
Love is.
Love...

You know love may sometimes make you cry,
So let the tears go,
They will flow away,
For you know love will always let you fly
...How far a heart can fly away!

[Chorus]

You know when love's shining in your eyes
It may be the stars
Fallen from above.
And you know love is with you when you rise,
For night and day belong to love.

Enya was born Eithne Ni Bhraonain in Donegal, Ireland. Enya studied classical music at college under private tuition. On leaving college she was asked by Producer Nicky Ryan to join her siblings in their family band. She did so for a short time, but found it too restrictive musically, and so in 1982 she joined Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan in a creative and business partnership. Enya's first commission was to write a score for Sir David Puttnam for his film ""The Frog Prince"". Then, the triumvirate secured the soundtrack to the BBC documentary series 'The Celts'. Enya was then signed by Warner Music and all three by EMI Music Publishing. The first album of this contract was ""Watermark"" with the hit single ""Orinoco Flow"". This was followed by ""Shepherd Moons"", ""The Memory of Trees"", ""Paint the Sky With Stars"", ""A Day Without Rain"" which produced the single, ""Only Time"". Enya also released ""Amarantine"" and for Lord of the Rings; the Fellowship of the Ring, the songs ""Aniron"" and ""May it Be"". Enya, Nicky and Roma were nominated for a Golden Globe Award and for an Academy Award for the song ""May it Be"" and have also merited many other nominations and awards, including the Ivor Novello for International Achievement. The latest honours bestowed on Enya were two Honorary Degrees, the University of Galway honoured her with Doctor of Music and the University of Ulster honoured Enya with Doctor of Letters.

LYRICS:
(Jason Aalon Butler)
Bitch don’t play with us,
We far too dangerous
End up with a noose around your neck
Tryna hang with us
Better give up or we’ll take you down
Watch the crown
Get us started then it’s over BLAU!
Make a statement, say it loud
Fuck the game and then take a bow

(Jacoby Shaddix)
That’s right, got you running for your life
Got you praying on your knees
That you make it through the night
Yeah you stepping in the wrong place
At the wrong time,
Walking right into the knife,
Are you stupid are you blind?

Pre:
(Jacoby Shaddix)
(Hey!) Am I talking to you clearly?
(Ho!) Cause I don’t think you hear me

Chorus:
We see it how we call it, (don’t swerve in my lane)
Motherfuckers going all in, (don’t swerve in my lane)
So you better be cautious, (don’t swerve in my lane)
I will never hesitate if you swerve in my lane

V2:
(Jacoby Shaddix)
It’s like you need the hype,
All that bullshit in ya life
Got you talking evil-like
You know you can’t pay the price
Why you even trying to control me
Posing like a trophy,
We’re not affiliated in any way
You don’t know me

(Sueco)
X on my chest mark the spot I’m a target
I’m not from this earth ET I’m a martian
Fuck with my money put his face on milk cartons
Welcome to the jungle she my Jane and I’m Tarzan (ay)
Sub-zero finish him Mortal Kombat
Skirt off in a beamer, I’ma leave him like a mile back
My brother made a box from a dime bag
Now we eating good (hey), pockets playing lineback

Pre:
(Jason Aalon Butler)
So back up,
Or it’s bang bang bang
Get smacked up,
If you ain’t gang, gang, gang 

We see it how we call it, (don’t swerve in my lane)
Motherfuckers going all in, (don’t swerve in my lane)
So you better be cautious, (don’t swerve in my lane)
I will never hesitate if you swerve in my lane

We see it how we call it, (don’t swerve in my lane)
Motherfuckers going all in, (don’t swerve in my lane)
So you better be cautious, (don’t swerve in my lane

LYRICS: 
No love no feelings
I choke on the air  I’m breathing 
Undone unhealing 
Ain’t nobody stopping the bleeding 
Deaf with demons on both sides 
Can’t think no angel left insight 
Chained to this static in my mind 
And I can't hide 

Hook:
this rage I just can't escape 
screaming at my face 
so loud I can't hear my voice
breaking through my mistakes 
free fall into grace 
I'm not insane 
it's time to kill the noise 
kill the noise


My scars keep screaming 
I live through the pain for a reason 
My god my anger 
It drags me down like an anchor 
I'm deaf with demons on both sides 
Can’t think no angel left in sight 
Chained to this static in my mind 
And I can't hide 

Hook:
this rage I just can't escape 
screaming at my face 
so loud I can't hear my voice
breaking through my mistakes 
free fall into grace 
I'm not insane 
it's time to kill the noise 
kill the noise

SHUT UP!!!!!!!

I am a man at war
And I am fighting for
All of the broken people, all of the people thrown overboard
They always tried to shame us
But they don't speak our language
No we're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness
Oh, somebody sound the alarm
Oh, a fire was set in the dark
Oh, it's time that you know
No we're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness
It doesn't matter if the world has gone mad
If we just hold on, if we just hold on, yeah
The sky is falling and the world has gone mad
And we sing our songs and we just hold on, yeah
So if you're running, stop running
One life, one chance, start living
Sing it louder just to let the world know

They say that I'm reckless
Because I'm relentless
They spit on my face and curse on my name, they're taking my life in vengeance
Yeah, you can try and blame us
And try to take what's sacred
No we're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness
Oh, somebody sound the alarm
Oh, a fire was set in the dark
Oh, it's time that you know

Summertime,
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high

Oh, Your daddy's rich
And your mamma's good lookin'
So hush little baby
Don't you cry

One of these mornings
You're going to rise up singing
Then you'll spread your wings
And you'll take to the sky

But 'til that morning
There's a'nothing can harm you
With your daddy and mammy 
Standing by
Don't you cry

Lyrics:
He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Diamond nights and ruby lights high in the sky
Heaven help him when he falls
Diamond life, lover boy
We move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start
No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male
Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale
Face to face, each classic case
We shadow box and double cross
Yet need the chase
A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold
No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male
Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale
Smooth operator

Lyrics

You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you want
Ha ah ah ah ah ah
And if only you could see into me

Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me

When you're on the outside baby and you can`t get in
I will show you you're so much better than you know
When you're lost and you're alone and you can't get back again
I will find you darling and I will bring you home

And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes
And in no time
You'll be fine

You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you want
Ha ah ah ah ah ah
And if only you could see into me

Oh when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh when you're low
I'll be there
By your side baby

Oh when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh when you're low
I'll be there
By your side baby

Lyrics

I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
I gave you love
I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love
You took my love 
Didn't I tell you
What I believe
Did somebody say that
A love like that won't last
Didn't I give you
All that I've got to give baby 

I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
I gave you love
I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love
You took my love 

I keep crying
I keep trying for you
There's nothing like you and I baby 

This is no ordinary love
No ordinary Love
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary Love 

When you came my way
You brightened every day
With your sweet smile 

Didn't I tell you
What I believe
Did somebody say that
A love like that won't last
Didn't I give you
All that I've got to give baby 

This is no ordinary love
No ordinary Love
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary Love 

I keep crying
I keep trying for you
There's nothing like you and I baby 

This is no ordinary love
No ordinary Love
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary Love 

Keep trying for you
Keep crying for you
Keep flying for you
Keep flying I'm falling 

I'm falling 

Keep trying for you
Keep crying for you
Keep flying for you
Keep flying for you I'm falling
I'm falling

Lyrics

There must have been an angel by my side 
Something heavenly led me to you 
Look at the sky 
It's the color of love 
There must have been an angel by my side 
Something heavenly came down from above 
He led me to you 
He led me to you 
He built a bridge to your heart 
All the way 
How many tons of love inside 
I can't say 
 
When I was led to you 
I knew you were the one for me 
I swear the whole world could feel my heartbeat 
When I lay eyes on you 
Ay ay ay 
You wrapped me up in 
The color of love 
 
You gave me the kiss of life 
Kiss of Life 
You gave me the kiss that's like 
The kiss of life 
 
Wasn't it clear from the start 
Look the sky is full of love 
Yeah the sky is full of love 
He built a bridge to your heart 
All the way 
How many tons of love inside 
I can't say 
 
You gave me the kiss of life 
Kiss of Life 
You gave me the kiss that's like 
The kiss of life 
 
You gave me the kiss of life 
Kiss of Life 
You gave me the kiss that's like 
The kiss of life 
 
You gave me the kiss of life 
Kiss of Life 
You gave me the kiss that's like 
The kiss of life 
 
You wrapped me up in the color of love 
Must have been an angel come down from above 
Giving me love yeah 
Giving me love yeah 
 
You gave me the kiss of life 
Kiss of Life 
You gave me the kiss of life

Your love is king, crown you in my heart
Your love is king, never need to part
Your kisses ring, round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me, it's making my soul sing
Tearing the very heart of me, I'm crying out for more

Your love is king, crown you in my heart
Your love is king, you're the ruler of my heart
Your kisses ring, round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me, it's making my soul sing
I'm crying out for more, your love is king

I'm coming on, I'm coming
You're making me dance, inside

Your love is king, crown you in my heart
Your love is king, never need to part
Your kisses ring, round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me, it's making my soul sing
Tearing the very heart of me, I'm crying out for more

Touching the very part of me, it's making my soul sing
I'm crying out for more, your love is king
This is no blind faith, this is no sad and sorry dream
This is no blind faith, your love, your love is real

Gotta crown me with your heart
(Your love is king)
Never, never need to part

Lyrics

If I tell you
If I tell you now
Will you keep on
Will you keep on loving me?
If I tell you
If I tell you how I feel
Will you keep bringing out the best in me?

You give me, you give me the sweetest taboo
You give me, you're giving me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me

There's a quiet storm
And it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm
That is you
There's a quiet storm
And it never felt this hot before
Giving me something that's taboo
(Sometimes I think you're just too good for me)

You give me the sweetest taboo
That's why I'm in love in with you (with you)
You give me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me
(Sometimes I think you're just too good for me)

I'd do anything for you, I'd stand out in the rain
Anything you want me to do, don't let it slip away
There's a quiet storm
And it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm
I think it's you
There's a quiet storm
And I never felt this hot before
Giving me something that's taboo

You give me the (you give me, you give me the) sweetest taboo
That's why I'm in love with you (with you)
You give me, keep giving me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me

You've got the biggest heart
Sometimes I think you're just too good for me
Every day is Christmas, and every night is New Year's Eve
Will you keep on loving me
Will you keep on, will you keep on
Bringing out the best in me

Lyrics

In Heaven's name why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love.
In Heaven's name why do you play these games?
Hang on to your love.
Take time if you're down on luck.
It's so easy to walk out on love.
Take your time if the going gets tough.
It's so precious.
So if you want it to get stronger you'd better not let go.
You've got to hold on longer if you want you love to grow.
Got to stick together, hand in glove.
Hold on tight, don't fight.
Hang on to your love.
In Heaven's name why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love.
In Heaven's name why do you play these games?
Hang on to your love.
Be brave when the journey is rough,
It's not easy when you're in love.
Don't be ashamed when the going gets tough
It's not easy,
Don't give up.
If want it to get stronger you'd better not let go.
You got to hold on longer if you want you love to grow.
Got to stick together, hand in glove.
Hold on tight, don't fight.
Hang on to your love.
In Heaven's name why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love.
In Heaven's name why do you play these games?
Hang on to your love.
So if want it to get stronger you'd better not let go.
You got to hold on longer if you want you love to grow.
Got to stick together, hand in glove.
Hold on tight, don't fight.
Hang on to your love.
In Heaven's name why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love.
In Heaven's name why do you play these games?
Hang on to your love.
When you find a love, don't let it walk away.
When you find your love, you got to make it stay.
Don't let it walk away.
When you find your love, you got to make it stay.
You've got to hang on to your love.
You've got to hang on to your love.
Why are you walking away?

Lyrics

You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer 
If you were mine
If you were mine
I wouldn't want to go to heaven 

I cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running
You're ruling the way that I move
You take my air 

You show me how deep love can be 

You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer 

I Cherish the Day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running
I Cherish the Day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
Won't run away

You show me how deep love can be
You show me how deep love can be
This is my prayer 

I Cherish the Day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
Won't run away
Won't shy 

I Cherish the Day
I won't go astray 

I Cherish the Day
I Cherish the Day
I Cherish the Day
I Cherish the Day
I Cherish the Day

Me with the floorshow
Kickin' with your torso
Boys getting high
And the girls even more so
Wave your hands if your not with the man
Can I kick it?
(Yes you can)
I got
(Funk)
You got
(Soul)
We got everybody
I've got the gift
Gonna stick it in the goal
It's time to move your body

Babylon back in business
Can I get a witness?
Every girl, every man
Houston, do you hear me?
Ground control, can you feel me?
Need permission to land
I don't wanna rock, DJ
But your making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ?
Cos you're keepin' me up all night

Singin' in the classes
Music for your masses
Give no head
No backstage passes
Have a proper giggle
I'll be quite polite
But when I rock the mic
I rock the mic
(Right)
You got no love, then you're with the wrong man
It's time to move your body
If you can't get a girl
But your best friend can
It's time to move your body

I don't wanna be sleazy
Baby just tease me
Got no family planned
Houston, do you hear me?
Ground control, can you feel me?
Need permission to land
I don't wanna rock DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ?
Cos you're keeping me up all night

I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ?
Cos your keeping me up all night

Pimpin' aint easy
Most of them fleece me
Every night
Pimpin' ain't easy
But if you're sellin' it
It's alright

Come on

I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ?
Cos you're keeping me up all night

I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ?
Cos you're keeping me up all night",False,False,201457474.0,pop music
