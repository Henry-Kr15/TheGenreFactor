Letra:

Todo lo contienes en tu obra magistral
es tu bella esencia que revela la verdad
tintes de conciencia y de singularidad
amando por la eternidad

Hey tu sutil universo
Hey tu sutil universo

Eres padre y madre en la forma en la que estas
siento tu presencia t√∫ me gu√≠as al andar
pero la mismo tiempo de inventar mi realidad
amando lo que tu me das

Hey tu sutil universo
Hey tu sutil universo
Hey tu sutil universo
Hey tu sutil universo

Tu cuerpo astral me acobijar√°
me dir√° tu a salvo est√°s
s√≥lo quiero regresar

A tu sutil universo
Hey tu sutil universo
Hey tu sutil universo",True,True,1046151.0,Latin pop

Lyrics:

In the night the light is better
Before the dawn comes around

I‚Äôd been living in a different time
Always listening to different minds
Had a feeling i was in denial

I‚Äôd been living in a little lie
Always looking but i paid no mind
Had the number i just had to dial.

You and i were meant to heal together
If you close your eyes can you see inside

I‚Äôd been learning how to live my life
Always listening to different rhymes 
Had a feeling i was bound to fly

I‚Äôve been trying for a you and I
Always looking for an alibi
But i knew that i could see the signs

Every time i see the doorway
I‚Äôd be remiss to just stand by
 
I‚Äôd been living in a different time
Always listening to different rhymes
Had a feeling i was in denial

I‚Äôd been living in a little lie
Always looking but i paid no mind
Had the number i just had to dial.

Heal your soul
Heal your soul

You and i were meant to heal together
Dancing in the night just to feel alive

I‚Äôd been learning how to live my life
Always listening to different rhymes 
Had a feeling i was bound to fly

I‚Äôve been trying for a you and I
Always looking for an alibi
But i knew that i could see the signs

You and i were meant to heal together
You and i were meant to heal together

Letra:

No te sientas as√≠ no te quise ofender
Pues no fue mi intensi√≥n
Solo hable por mi corazon
Es muy claro que tu nada sientes por mi
Yo lo entiendo esta bien
Pero quiero decirte antes de partir
Que a donde vayas
Vas a encontrarte alg√∫n lividinoso
Que te hable palabras rom√°nticas
A donde vayas
Tarde o temprano
Tocara alguien tu mano
Y un beso le pedir√°s
Con tu mirar
Entonces vas a comprender
Lo que es sentir amor as√≠
Querr√°s que no se r√≠an mas de ti
O no causar tan solo lastima
Entonces solo pensaras
Si siente el mismo amor por ti
Si aciertas tu por fin seras feliz
Pero si no entre un llanto pensaras en mi

Lyrics:
""...congressional reports. President Ford says that he's disappointed with Congress's performance. In Detroit, a Pontiac,
Michigan youth was reported dead at the scene of a head-on collision on Grand Avenue this morning. The youth was reportedly
driving on the wrong side of the boulevard when he struck a delivery truck and was catapulted through the windshild of his
car. The driver of the truck is reported to be uninjured. The identities of both men are being withheld by local police.
County legislatives today are expected to rally to the aid of striking longshoremen in hopes of ending the 9 month
deadlock...""
""...and roll all nite and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all nite and party every day...""

I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine o'clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do, I got to

Get up, everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down, everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit rock city

Get up, everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down, everybody's gonna leave their seat

Getting late
I just can't wait
Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink, then I smoke
Start up the car, and I try to make the midnight show

Get up, everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down, everybody's gonna leave their seat

Movin' fast, doin' 95
Hit top speed but I'm still movin' much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive
I hear my song playin' on the radio, it goes

Get up, everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down, everybody's gonna leave their seat

Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock
There's a truck ahead, lights starin' at my eyes
Oh my God, no time to turn

Lyrics:
Watch your tongue or have it cut from your head
Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid
Children roam the streets now orphans of war
Bodies hanging in the streets to adore
Royal flames will carve a path in chaos, bringing daylight to the night
Death is riding into town with armor, they've come to take all your rights
Hail to the King
Hail to the One
Kneel to the crown
Stand in the sun
Hail to the King
Hail, Hail, Hail the King
Blood is spilt while holding keys to the throne.
Born again but it's too late to atone.
No mercy -- from the edge of the blade
Dare escape and learn the price to be paid
Let the water flow with shades of red now, Arrows black out all the light
Death is riding into town with armor, they've come to grant you your rights
Hail to the King
Hail to the One
Kneel to the crown
Stand in the sun
Hail to the King
Hail, Hail, Hail the King
There's a taste of fear
When the henchmen call
Iron fist to tame the land
Iron fist to claim it all
Hail to the King
Hail to the One
Kneel to the crown
Stand in the sun
Hail to the King
Hail, Hail, Hail the King

Lyrics:
Nightmare!
(Now your nightmare comes to life)

Dragged ya down below
Down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever
Peace of mind is less than never
Hate to twist your mind
But God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed
Burn the world your last endeavor

Flesh is burning
You can smell it in the air
Cause men like you have
Such easy soul to steal (steal)
So stand in line while
They ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave
Until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness,
Burning, haunting, yearning
Pull the trigger

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know
That you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare

(While your nightmare comes to life)

Can't wake up and sweat
'Cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons
Victim of your own creation
Beyond the will to fight
Where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason
Loathing self-assassination

You've been lied to
Just to rape you of your site
And now they have the nerve
To tell you how to feel (feel)
So sedated as they
Medicate your brain
And while you slowly
Go insane they tell ya
""Given with the best intentions
help you with your complications""

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know
That you belong here, yeah
No one to call
Everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare

Fight
Not to fail
Not to fall
Or you'll end up like the others
Die
Die again
Drenched in sin
With no respect for another

Down
Feel the fire
Feel the hate
Your pain is what we desire
Lost
Hit the wall
Watch you crawl
Such a replaceable liar

And I know you hear their voices
Calling from above
And I know they may seem real
These signals of love
But our life's made up of choices
Some without appeal
They took for granted your soul
And it's ours now to steal

(As your nightmare comes to life)

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know
That you belong here, yeah
No one to call
Everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare

Lyrics:
Like walking into a dream, so unlike what you've seen
So unsure but it seems, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here - so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway 

I see a distant light
But girl this can't be right... 
Such a surreal place to see
So how did this come to be?
Arrived too early

And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life and realize this is going too far

I don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right, to move on and on
Far away from here! 

Place of hope and no pain, perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place but refrain, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here - so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway

This peace on earth's not right (with my back against the wall) 
No pain or sign of time... (I'm much too young to fall) 
So out of place, don't wanna stay
I feel wrong and that's my sign
I've made up my mind

Give me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life

I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right, to move on and on
Far away from here! 
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hope you might, take me back inside
When the time is right! 

Loved ones back home all crying 'cause they're already missing me
I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be
(I am unbroken; I'm choking on this ecstasy! )
Oh Lord I'll try so hard but you gotta let go of me
(Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another chance to live! )

Aah! 

I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right, to move on and on
Far away from here! 
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hope you might, take me back inside
When the time is right!

Lyrics:
""He who makes a beast out of himself, gets rid of the pain of being a man""

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay.
I tried to drive all through the night,
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights.
No oasis here to see, the sand is singing deathless words to me.

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone).
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction.
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone).
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention.

As I adjust to my new sights the rarely tired lights will take me to new heights.
My hand is on the trigger I'm ready to ignite.
Tomorrow might not make it but everything's all right.
Mental fiction, follow me; show me what it's like to be set free.

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone).
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction.
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone).
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention.

So sorry you're not here I've been chained too long my vision's so unclear.
Now take a trip with me but don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem.

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay.
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today.

Sometimes I don't know why we'd rather live than die,
We look up towards the sky for answers to our lives.
We may get some solutions but most just pass us by,
Don't want your absolution cause I can't make it right.
I'll make a beast out of myself, gets rid of all the pain of being a man.

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone).
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction.
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone).
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention.

So sorry you're not here I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear.
Now take a trip with me but don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem.
I've known it from the start all these good ideas will tear your brain apart.
Scared but you can follow me I'm too weird to live but much too rare to die.

Lyrics:
Let's take a moment and break the ice
So my intentions are known
See I have pity in watching you suffer
I know the feeling of being damned alone
I've got a storybook of my own

Don't you see I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(And you know it's right)
I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire

Well I can promise you paradise
No need to serve on your knees
And when you're lost in the darkest of hours
Take a moment and tell me who you see
Won't tell you who not to be

Now you know I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(And you know it's right)
I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire

Disciple of the cross and champion in suffering
Immerse yourself into the Kingdom of Redemption
Pardon your mind from the chains of the divine
Make way, the Shepherd of Fire

Through the ages of time
I've been known for my hate
But I'm a dealer of simple choices
For me its never too late

I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(And you know it's right)
I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
I am your wrath, I am your guilt, I am your lust!
(And you know it's right)
I am your law, I am your scar, I am your trust
Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire

Lyrics:
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love purpose hard to find
While I recall all the words you spoke to me
Can't help but wish that I was there
Back where I'd love to be, oh yeah

Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
to hold her when I'm not around,
when I'm much too far away
We all need that person who can be true to you
But I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again oh no
Once again

There's nothing here for me on this barren road
There's no one here while the city sleeps
and all the shops are closed
Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah

Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
to hold her when I'm not around,
when I'm much too far away
We all need that person who can be true to you
I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again oh no
Once again

Some search, never finding a way
Before long, they waste away
I found you, something told me to stay
I gave in, to selfish ways
And how I miss someone to hold
when hope begins to fade...

A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love purpose hard to find

Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
to hold her when I'm not around,
when I'm much too far away
We all need the person who can be true to you
I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again oh no
Once again

Lyrics:
Before the story begins
Is it such a sin
For me to take what's mine
Until the end of time?
We were more than friends
Before the story ends
And I will take what's mine
Create what God would never design

Our love had been so strong for far too long
I was weak with fear that something would go wrong
Before the possibilities came true
I took all possibility from you
Almost laughed myself to tears(Ahahaha)
Conjuring her deepest fears(Come here you fucking bitch)
Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
I can't believe itRipped her heart out right before her eyes
Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it
She was never this good in bed even when she was sleeping
Now she's just so perfect, I've never been quite so fucking deep in her
It goes on and on, and on
I can keep you looking young and preserved forever
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time but bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
Baby don't cry
You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah
But baby don't cry

Now possibilities I'd never considered
Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
To repossess a body with which I misbehave
Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears
Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it (Eat the shit out of it)
Now that it's done, I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize
From somewhere far beyond the grave
I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time but bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry
You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah
But baby don't cry

I willsufferfor so long
(What will you do? Not long enough)
To make it up to you
(I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do
(Well then I'll grant you one chance)
And if it's not enough
(If it's not enough, it's not enough)
If it's not enough
(Not enough)
Try again
(Try again)
And again
(And again)
Over and over again

We're coming back, coming back
We'll live forever, live forever
Let's have a wedding, have a wedding
Let's start the killing, start the killing

Do you take this man to death
For the rest of your unnatural life?
(Yes, I do)
Do you take this woman to death
For the rest of your unnatural life?
(I do)
I now pronounce you

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time but bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry
You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah
But baby don't cry

This video is a raw and emotional tribute to Avenged Sevenfold's late drummer Jimmy ""The Rev"" Sullivan and celebrates the long-time friendship the band members have shared since forming A7X in Huntington Beach, CA, in 1999. The video was directed by Wayne Isham, who has directed videos for such artists as Metallica, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Megadeth, and Def Leppard, among many others. The heartfelt quality of the video is in keeping with the emotional resonance of the song, a very personal goodbye to Sullivan that appears on the band's album Nightmare.

Lyrics:
Never feared for anything
Never shamed but never free
A life to heal the broken heart with all that it could
Lived a life so endlessly
Saw beyond what others see
I tried to heal your broken heart with all that I could

Will you stay?
Will you stay away forever?

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away

Plans of what our futures hold
Foolish lies of growing old
It seems we're so invincible
The truth is so cold

A final song, a last request
A perfect chapter laid to rest
Now and then I try to find a place in my mind

Where you can stay
You can stay away forever

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away

Sleep tight, I'm not afraid
The ones that we love are here with me
Lay away a place for me
Cause as soon as I'm done I'll be on my way
To live eternally

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
And the light you left remains but it's so hard to stay
When I have so much to say but you're so far away

I love you
You were ready
The pain is strong and urges rise
But I'll see you
When He lets me
Your pain is gone, your hands untied

So far away
And I need you to know
So far away
And I need you to, need you to know

Lyrics:

As the light hits you, 
As you shift along the floor, 
I find it hard to place my face. 
How did I come to be here, anyway? 
It's terribly vague, what's gone before.

I could have been anyone. 
You could have been anyone's dream. 
Why did you have to choose our moment? 
Why did you have to make me feel that? 
Why did you make it so unreal? 

Oh! To be in love, 
And never get out again. 
Oh! To be in love, 
And never get out again. 
Oh! To be in love, 
And never get out again. 

All the colours look brighter now. 
Everything they say seems to sound new. 
Slipping into tomorrow too quick, 
Yesterday always too good to forget. 
Stop the swing of the pendulum! Let us through!

Oh! To be in love, 
And never get out again. 
Oh! To be in love, 
And never get out again. 
Oh! To be in love, 
And never get out again.",False,False,9825739.0,art rock

Lyrics:
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

(Wooh!)
Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong

(Don't you come back no more)
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoe‚Äôs
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's
Gang

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

LYRICS:
Don‚Äôt have to leave this town to see the world
‚ÄôCause it‚Äôs something that I gotta do
I don‚Äôt wanna look back in thirty years
And wonder who you‚Äôre married to
Wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear
When you love someone
They say you set ‚Äôem free
But that ain‚Äôt gonna work for me

I don‚Äôt wanna live without you
I don‚Äôt wanna even breathe
I don‚Äôt wanna dream about you
I wanna wake up with you next to me
I don‚Äôt wanna go down any other road now
I don‚Äôt wanna love nobody but you
Lookin‚Äô in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don‚Äôt wanna love nobody but you

All the wasted days, all the wasted nights
I blame it all on being young
Got no regrets ‚Äôcause it got me here
But I don‚Äôt wanna waste another one
I been thinkin‚Äô about what I want in my life
It begins and ends the same
If I had to choose what I couldn‚Äôt lose
There would only be one thing

I don‚Äôt wanna live without you
I don‚Äôt wanna even breathe
I don‚Äôt wanna dream about you
I wanna wake up with you next to me
I don‚Äôt wanna go down any other road now
I don‚Äôt wanna love nobody but you
Lookin‚Äô in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don‚Äôt wanna love nobody but you

I wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear

I don‚Äôt wanna live without you
I don‚Äôt wanna even breathe
I don‚Äôt wanna dream about you
I wanna wake up with you next to me
I don‚Äôt wanna go down any other road now
I don‚Äôt wanna love nobody but you
Lookin‚Äô in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don‚Äôt wanna love nobody but you

I don‚Äôt wanna love nobody but you
I don‚Äôt wanna love nobody but you

Letra / Lyrics: ‚ÄúNo conf√≠o‚Äù

Que mucho me jodio
Lo que tu me hiciste
Ojala y que te mientan as√≠ mismo como me mentiste 
Ya no vuelvo a seguir d√°ndote luz
Por mujeres como tu
Al amor le puse la cruz
Y no confio, te juro que no confio
Por dentro me puse frio
De ti no quiero saber
(Eoo deja el sentimiento torito y vamonos pa un teteo)

Cabr√≥n, qu√© pas√≥ 
Estoy borracho, igual que yo 
Mere cabron, que paso 
Estoy borracho, igual que yo

///Y you andamos en ruta y carretera Ruta y carretera
Estoy desacatao en la calle coje la acera ///
(Mi mujer me dice que le sea fiel) y yo nac√≠ por un cuerno
Te voa dar clase coge el cuaderno
Andamo en ruta y carretera aprendetela 
Tengo una menor en Bayam√≥n que la dej√© Fundia de biela
Prendela prendela que no se apague
A ella le gust√≤ lo que le traje
Le gusta que le encaje encima de la mesa  
De new york pa RD ella me manda mi remesa 
Todo lo que tengo a riversa a largo plazo 
Duro y con la fuerza de este caso
Yo tengo el mazo que ella la amasa
En la sala la cocina el cuarto y la terraza 
Yo tengo el mazo que ella la amasa
En la sala la cocina el cuarto y la terraza
///Y you andamos en ruta y carretera Ruta y carretera
Estoy desacatao en la calle coje la acera///
(Uhghg ugh na nan naa)

 Prendan el fili que se acab√≥ la botella
 Ella es mas mia que de ella
To el mundo rolliando y no se acaba el party
Aunque llamen los guardias y monten la querella
Esto es pa atras y pa lante parriba y pabajo
Ponteme arriba pa darte pa bajo
Te quiero ver como Cristo nos trajo
Chingamo y despues pal carajo
Hey, tu caile pal espot
No somos na, pero te doy con to
Yo no uso prendas y valgo mas que ustedes si en el cuello me enngacho las Travis Scott
Cabr√≥n, qu√© pas√≥ Estoy borracho, igual que yo Mere cabron, que paso Estoy borracho, igual que yo

All I Think About Now Lyrics:
I try to think about tomorrow
But I always think about the past

About the things that didn't last

If I could go to the beginning
Then for sure I would be another way

Make it better for today

If I could go to the beginning
I would be another way

Make it better for today

Remember when we were happy? 
If I'm late can I thank you now?

I'm gonna try anyhow

I remember we were happy
That's all I think about now

That's all I think about now
I remember we were happy

That's all I think about now
If you have any doubt

I was driving doing nothing
On the shores of Great Salt Lake
When they put it on the air
I put it in the hammer lane
I soon forgot myself
And I forgot about the brake
I forgot about all laws
And I forgot about the rain
They were talking on the 9
And all across the amy band
Across the road they were turning around
And headed south with me
It got so crowded on the road
I started driving in the sand
My head was feeling scared
But my heart was feeling free
The desert turned to mud
It seems that everybody heard
Everybody was remembering
To forget they had the chills
Then I heard the voices on a broadcast
From up on the bird
They were getting interviewed
By some Goodman whose name was Bill
I'm almost there to Vegas
Where they're puttin' on a show
They've come so far
I've lived this long
At least
I must just go and say hello",False,False,9548335.0,alternative rock

üé§ [Letra de ""Ma Nigga"" ft. Almighty, YG, Braulio Fogon & Dowba Montana]

[Intro: El Alfa]
To' el que 't√° corona'o y le quiere da' la' gracia' a Dio' porque tiene salu' y vida, cuando yo diga ""My"", ustede' dicen ""Nigga"":
My (Nigga)
My (Nigga)
Yeh, yo'

[Pre-Coro: El Alfa]
Y lo' moreno', cuando freno, me dicen: ""Lleg√≥ el nigga""
Y lo' moreno', cuando freno, me dicen: ""Lleg√≥ el nigga""
Y lo' moreno', cuando freno, me dicen: ""Lleg√≥ el nigga""
My nigga, my nigga, my nigga, my nigga
Y lo' moreno', cuando freno, me dicen: ""Lleg√≥ el nigga""
Y lo' moreno', cuando freno, me dicen: ""Lleg√≥ el nigga""
Y lo' mor–µno', cuando freno, me dicen: ""Ll–µg√≥ el nigga""
My nigga, my nigga, my nigga, my nigga

[Coro: El Alfa]
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
Y lo' moreno', cuando freno, me dicen: ""Lleg√≥ el nigga""
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
Y lo' moreno', cuando freno, me dicen: ""Lleg√≥ el nigga""

[Verso 1: El Alfa]
Yeh
Vestido de Bottega la Veneta, lambin
Tengo lo' bolsillo' full, todos lamban
Pa' que mueva' el loco hasta abajo, bang-bang
Somo' leyenda', la Wu-Tang Clan
Donde resbala un mono, yo te tiro hasta pirueta'
Me gusta montar la pura, siempre la concreta
Contigo no grabo porque tiene' una creta
De TikTok no damo' la receta
Embobinando bobo', el locu, el bobo lo embobina
Atracando gente con cotorra de la fina
Clan-clan, clan-clan, que te lo quite
Dame la cubana y lo' guillo', nunca me viste
To' la' menore' en Herrera por m√≠ se derriten
Yo le doy pa'll√° y la' suelto cuando se irriten
As√≠ como levanto pesa' levanto millone'
Tambi√©n levanto culo' y t√∫ bugarrone'
Con lo que vale mis Croki, yo compro tu carrera, ese e' el flow
Antes de morir, t√∫ conmigo Virgil Abloh
(Compro tu carrera, ese e' el flow
Antes de morir, t√∫ conmigo Virgil Abloh)

[Puente: El Alfa]
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)

[Coro: El Alfa]
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
Y lo' moreno', cuando freno, me dicen: ""Lleg√≥ el nigga""
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
Y lo' moreno', cuando freno, me dicen: ""Lleg√≥ el nigga""

[Verso 2: YG]
Four hunnin'
I'm that nigga, I'm really him
Me and hoes never work out, but I'm in the gym
St. Laurent trim while I'm spittin' gems
She wanna swallow it 'cause I'm getting M's
So many M's M&M's wanna sponsor me
Hoes wanna hang like apostrophes
Ride this dick, I'ma ride the beat
But after we fuck don't bother me
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco
That's how many hoes I got for my amigos
I kill a nigga for my people
Fourty with the bean pointed at your peephole
From the ghetto but I ain't cheat though
The money come easy I'm shootin' free throws
I like a lady, lady in the streets though
Real ass and titties but she a freak ho

[Verso 3: Almighty]
Almighty
Ando con El Alfa y tenemo' una pinta
La tuya quiere que la deje en cinta
Ella pens√≥ que es la √∫nica, en serio es como la quinta
Mi potra, vo'a llevarte pa' una finca
T√∫ encima te afinca', se menea como culebra
M√∫sica infinita, aqu√≠ no hay quiebra
'T√°n los blanco', 't√°n los negro', pero yo soy como cebra
Tengo lo bueno y lo malo, soy el oro con las piedra'
Morena, la mejor az√∫car es morena
Yo tambi√©n soy moreno, quiere verme entre las pierna'
Ella 'taba en el caser√≠o brillando como linterna
Y la poli se lleg√≥, gritaron: ""Agua a las cisternas""
No me mojo, no me mojo
Ojo por ojo pa'l que joda, la venganza te lleg√≥
Me dice: ""Nigga, ¬øc√≥mo llega' hasta las grandes ligas?""
Es f√°cil, no le pare', dale, siga, siga, siga
My nigga, my nigga (No-eh)
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My motherfuckin' nigga)
My nigga, my nigga, ah-ah-ah

Antes era sencilla ( era normal)
ahora esta crecia
fui yo el que la malacostumbre
cada vez que tenia sed
baja una de moet (moet)
solo le bajaba rose (rose)
Y Ahor me dice que le baje abajo Y
que me la coma como es ohhh
(Its the game changer)
mami tu estas creia (Almigth!)
quiere que le de una lambia
que me la coma como novia mia
Tu Dices J quiles
yo tengo una crecia y le pago los biles
la mando pal mall gasta miles
queria carro y la mude pa un dealer
perdi su contacto
y despues me contacto pa repetir el acto
antes teniamos un pacto
y ahora esta mas dura pa darle, exacto
Que le de pensado que es mi jeva
me quiere hacer pecar como eva
si le creo que no es como antes
que ahora esta hecha osea que es nueva
Esplica tu guille , explica tu humos
que esa fecas no te las consumo
con la gente te creces
yo te meto a veces y no lo presumo
siempre anda crecia ella y me pide mas
que le caiga atras
bebiendo champa√±a en el yacht siempre anda crecia ella y me exige mas (me exige mas)
pero to fue mi culpa
por que en ti me gasto el pote (x2)
Ahora esta vola
porque se hizo las nalgas y los senos
se hace la que no
pero hace tiempo ue nos conocemos so deja las miradas raras
que a ti te heche adentro y en la cara
marc anthony cuando quiero vuelve
y se lo mete a dayanara
o a jennifer lopez
ya he visto mas alla del escote
Ahora no chinga si no es en BM
o en bote
pero to fue mi culpa
por que en ti me gaste el pote
yo fui el que mando hacerte
las tetas y ese culote
En la cama con ella yo fumo
llegamos a Neptuno 
ella se crece a veces
pero sabe que soy el que la vacuno
He dicho mil uno
Que como yo no hay ninguno
te meto de dia y noche
y vienes a roncarle di que a uno
siempre anda crec√≠a ella y me pide mas
que le caiga atras
bebiendo champa√±a en el yacht siempre anda  crecia ella y me exige mas
pero to fue mi culpa
por que en ti me gaste el pote (x2)",True,True,53444579.0,Not Found

Malvada como serpiente, astuta, pero soy su veneno, (Yeh)
Cuando lo entre dime que se siente le digo lo saco? Y grita que no, grita que no,
Ella es prohibida pero le gusta lo ajeno,
Y si! Cuando estamos chingando nos falta el oxigeno.
 
Y juega conmigo, pero no tiene liga,
Ese culo pesa dime cuantos gigas?
Ella no se puya pero quiere figa, 
Me cole en la fila pa ver como desfila,
Esto es Fendi no es Fila,
Dile a tu hombre que el celu ya no tiene pila.

Textea‚Äô y me activa como Anfetamina,
Yo no soy el cielo, pero ven y subete arriba,
No existen amigos, pero buscate una amiga,
Tu eres la jefa, pero aqu√≠ es lo que yo diga.

Textea‚Äô y me activa como Anfetamina,
Yo no soy el cielo, pero se me trepa arriba, 
Y ella no es cristiana, y estamos fumando cristina, 
Tu eres la jefa, pero aqu√≠ es lo que yo diga.

Alta gama! Se puso roja como el Pama,
No vamos a dormir que pijama, 
Estamos a‚Äôfogote y las llamas, 
Mi reina no beses esas ranas,
Que no sera yo ni aunque el tipo rencarne ma√±ana, 
Le damos a las damas.

Sin goro no es el Ku klux Klan,
Sin hijo Plan B es el plan, 
Bajamos este queso un flan, 
Tengo los patos Lucas Fran,
Tu eres de las mujeres que no piden pero le dan,
No soy tu primero no soy tu Ad√°n, 
Pero beba ven dale una porno a tu fan, Bros Bang.

Le ped√≠ a Siri‚Ä¶.
Que te buscara, pero es que tu eres como Spirit,
Que coje mas vuelo que avion pa los kilis, 
Dile a tu dealer, que soy tu sobredosis, que tu eres Mac Miller
La tengo como zombie, soy Michael Jackson esto es Thriller,
Robando mujeres el stealer. 


Textea‚Äô y me activa como Anfetamina,
Yo no soy el cielo, pero se me trepa arriba, 
Y ella no es cristiana, y estamos fumando cristina, 
Tu eres la jefa, pero aqu√≠ es lo que yo diga.

Textea‚Äô y me activa como Anfetamina,
Yo no soy el cielo, pero ven y subete arriba,
No existen amigos, pero buscate una amiga,
Tu eres la jefa, pero aqu√≠ es lo que yo diga. 


(Cucha‚Äô, tres letras, La L) (Que‚Ä¶)


Tu andas con el boss, te pongo a que respete, chequea el pote de percos a ver cuantas hay,
Ella es una potra, yo soy su ginete me compra condones ni que Fire Ice,
Estamos prendio en fuego y chorrea‚Äô agua, 
Cuando se moja hay que buscar paraguas, 
Me la monto encima se mont√≥ en mi guagua, 
Y la puse de capota de Carola a Caguas. 

Llegamos a chingar, no vamo‚Äôa parar,
Trae una amiga y lo hacemo‚Äô en plural,
Enferma sexual yo te vo‚Äôa curar,
Yo me pongo Durex y te vo‚Äôa durar, 
No tiene pantys se le fue el moral, 
Range Rover Discovery pa‚Äô explorar, 
Yo cobro , cobro y pa depositar,
Me cierran el banco como el Doral,

El equipo del money esta de estae lao‚Äô,
Siempre se me ven anchos los bolsillos,
Por chanteo‚Äô 30 mil porque soy un pillo, 
En su cel me puso juez porque siempre la martillo.

Su cartera Louis y mi Glock con Vuitton,
La tengo tocandose en el fuiton,
Overdose de sexo un viaje pa‚Äô Pluton,
Le pedi una amiga porque soy gloton.


(Queee) (Queee)


Bajen prepagos, que yo las pago,
Le perdimos el valor a los chavos,
Yo detras de ella ya parezco un cabo, 
Lo nuestro es oculto como en los clavos. 

Bajen prepagos, que yo las pago,

Lyrics: 
Uah it's the game changer
Uah Almighty uahh
Ra, Rauw
 
Dime que a mi mente la hecho
No soy cupido pero la flecho por ti
Cayeron unos cuantos preso
Por como mami t√∫ te ves, se siente
La presi√≥n cuando llega, todos en la
Disco la quieren, pero la baby no se deja, Tiene claro que ella es.
 
Abusadora a ella no todo el mundo la conoce, pero se enamoran cuando baila
Tiene una mirada que me devora y me dejo comer, siempre anda sola nunca se guarda despues de las doce si tienes una amiga ven y traela que se olvide que tiene novio y que apague su cel.
  
Baby estoy pa ti i‚Äôe dime que vamos hacer, vamonos de aqui ohh pa acabar en el motel lo que empezo aqui, hoy te quiero comer, dime que vas hacer que en tu casa yo me voy aparecer
Diablo mami que abuso
Fria y moja flow buso e‚Äô
Los tiene a to' confuso
Porque frontearon pero ninguno
Puede decir que te lo puso e‚Äô
Dile que no hay break que andas sola
Y que la movie esta en play que ya tu eres una reina sin rey y las tiene hablando mierda porque en su cuerpo
no encuentran mistake.
 
Maldita sea la hora en que te conoci
Ella tenia carita de yo no fui, cuando la vi dije, esta si me dicen que se mete extasis yo como quiera a ella fue que le di el enfasi y contenerce contigo baby no es facil, saco la suit en el San Jua o el Embassy y ha ella le gusta la vida noctura, sola se masturba hombre que le tira le pichea con la curva

Tu lo que tienes es un abuso quiere
Que le baje al poso como un buso, me
Tiene confuso porque cambio el nombre que en el instagram se puso
Yo soy su recluso y ella es una abusiva
Dice que es exclusiva, quiere hacerlo en carros con las puertas suicida y si por mi fuera tu mueres aqui encima
Abusas del poder porque eres mi medicina ieh ieh
  
Abusadora a ella no todo el mundo la conoce, pero se enamoran cuando baila
Tiene una mirada que me devora y me dejo comer, siempre anda sola nunca se guarda despues de las doce si tienes una amiga ven y traela que se olvide que tiene novio y que apague su cel.
 
Mi ganadora, dime que quieres de mi
Pasan las horas ya vamonos de aqui
Pa que de ti abuse ie ie y las perco use ie ie, no quiero excusa ma a ver quien dura mas.
  
Hoy ando con mi bando
Y tu andas con el tuyo
Deja el orgullo que va a ser
Mio todo lo que es tuyo
Hoy nos quedamos con el canton
Las puertas pa'tras que andamos
En el phantom
Ella no pelea no coge lucha
Tiene detras a los hombre a las bucha
Tus amigas tienen novio y es obvio que me escuchan que se agarren porque el  palo se cerrucha tienen peste a gare y se les da√±a el asicale estas mujeres estan algare, ie vente pa la guerra con los militares, cuando manejan soy el pare, Poseidon en los mares.
 
Abusadora a ella no todo el mundo la conoce, pero se enamoran cuando baila

üìù Letra:
Hoy recib√≠ una llamada
De esas de antes pa' hacerme una invitaci√≥n
Como no lograron nada
Pues se molestan cuando yo 
Mantengo mi posici√≥n 
Y entonces 

¬øPa‚Äô que preguntan?, si me conocen
Aqu√≠ no hay vida socio
Despu√©s de las doce
¬øPa‚Äô que preguntan?, si esto no es juego
Yo se los dije ya
//Que soy un hombre nuevo//
No ando de aqu√≠ pa' ll√° de all√° pa' c√°
Que soy un hombre nuevo

Trae un par de toallas
Vamo pa' la playa 
Sol, arena, leche y miel
Y sin medalla
Siempre hay uno 
Que quiere pasarse de la raya
Pero no van a derribar esta muralla 
Ya yo no busco lo que ustedes buscan
Ya no me junto pa' lo que ustedes se juntan 
Las cosas viejas a mi vida no se ajustan 
Si saben que lo que conmigo ¬øpa‚Äô qu√© preguntan?

Yes mi pasado se qued√≥ 
En el erase una vez
Te me vas con tu propuesta en 
Uno, dos, tres
Conmigo eviten el estr√©s 
Si ya me conocen pues.

¬øPa‚Äô que preguntan?, si me conocen
Aqu√≠ no hay vida socio
Despu√©s de las doce
¬øPa‚Äô que preguntan?, si esto no es juego
Yo se los dije ya
//Que soy un hombre nuevo//
No ando de aqu√≠ pa' ll√° de all√° pa' c√°
Que soy un hombre nuevo

Las cosas viejas ya pasaron
O es que t√∫ quieres que yo vuelva 
A las fiestas que me tumbaron 
Hacen le√±a si se cae el palo
Y aunque se vistan de reyes 
Yo no quiero sus regalos
Ir pa' la calle eso no es malo
Todo es l√≠cito, pero no todo conviene dijo Pablo
Para que yo me salvara el soport√≥ los clavos
¬øT√∫ quieres que me ensucie despu√©s que me lavo?
Mmmm que mal negocio socio
Y las malas decisiones las tom√© en el mundo
L√≠brame de labios inmundos
Que los virus se contagian en segundos.

Son dos o tres los cont√©
Ten√≠a una par de panas
Y ahora ninguno se ve 
Que no es por falta de tiempo
Es falta de inter√©s 
No cuenten conmigo otra vez

Mejor vamos pa' la playa
Tr√°ete un par de toallas 
Con el sol la arena, ¬°te dije que no!
Si ustedes saben c√≥mo soy
Y entonces.

¬øPa' que preguntan?, si me conocen
Aqu√≠ no hay vida socio
Despu√©s de las doce
¬øPa' que preguntan?, si esto no es juego
Yo se los dije ya
//Que soy un hombre nuevo//
No ando de aqu√≠ pa' ll√° de all√° pa' c√°
Que soy un hombre nuevo

Y perdona si te aflijo
Se ten√≠a que decir y se dijo
Y ahora vivo como hijo
Se ten√≠a que decir y se dijo

Que soy un hombre nuevo

LYRICS:
I never get lonely
I got these ghosts to keep me company
I took the rearview off this old Ford so I only see in front of me
Now the past is out of sight and out of mind
Swore I changed, now I‚Äôm back chasing these white lines. 

I‚Äôm just a long haired son of a sinner
Searching for new ways I can get gone
I‚Äôm a pedal to the highway if you ever wonder why we write these songs
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm only one drink away from the devil
I‚Äôm only one call away from home
Yeah, I‚Äôm somewhere in the middle
I guess I‚Äôm just a little
Right and wrong

These backroads got me
These pills pretend to be my friend
I‚Äôm done for the last time
I‚Äôm lying to myself again
I always say that
Now I‚Äôm on my way back here somehow
I should know by now

I‚Äôm just a long haired son of a sinner
Searching for new ways I can get gone
I‚Äôm a pedal to the highway if you ever wonder why we write these songs
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm only one drink away from the devil
I‚Äôm only one call away from home
Yeah, I‚Äôm somewhere in the middle
I guess I‚Äôm just a little
Right and wrong

Mistakes I made I paid for them in cash
Walked a million miles on broken glass
I‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôm fading
My hearts been slowing breaking
Might pop a pill, and smoke and maybe drink
Talk to God and tell him what I think
At first He‚Äôs gonna hate me
But eventually He‚Äôll save me

I‚Äôm just a long haired son of a sinner
Searching for new ways I can get gone
I‚Äôm a pedal to the highway if you ever wonder why we write these songs
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm only one drink away from the devil
I‚Äôm only one call away from home
Yeah, I‚Äôm somewhere in the middle
I guess I‚Äôm just a little

LYRICS:
I only talk to God when I need a favor
and I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior (Oh oh)
if I only talk to God when I need a favor
God I need a favor

I know amazing grace, but I ain't been livin them words
Swear I spend most Sundays drunk off my ass than I have at church
Hard cover King James been only saving dust on the nightstand
And I don‚Äôt know what to say by the time I fold my hands

I only talk to God when I need a favor
and I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior (Oh oh)
if I only talk to God when I need a favor
God I need a favor

Amen‚Ä¶Amen

I owe you more than one, and beggars can't be choosers
But I'll pay for all I‚Äôve done just please don't let me lose her

I only talk to God when I need a favor
and I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior (Oh oh)
if I only talk to God when I need a favor
God I need a favor

Amen‚Ä¶Amen‚Ä¶Amen‚Ä¶Amen

Hanging in there, just barely 
throwin‚Äô up prayers, like hail mary's
If he's still there, lord spare me
Oh my God, oh my God ‚Äì hail mary

Hanging in there, just barely 
throwin‚Äô up prayers, like hail mary's
If he's still there, lord spare me
Oh my God, oh my God ‚Äì hail mary

I only talk to God when I need a favor
and I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So tell me who the hell am I, to expect a savior 
when I only talk to God when I need a favor
God I need a favor

Amen
God I need a favor (whoa oh)
Amen

LYRICS:
See the sunrise in her eyes
before the cold November rain
If you only knew her smile
never know that she‚Äôs in pain
Nobody ever saw it comin
it started with a little pill
One thing led to another
Since then it's all been downhill

She was the life of the party
She was the one everybody
Used to wanna hang around
I bet they wonder where she is now
I wish I woulda known
Before she was too far gone
I‚Äôm afraid to lose her now
She's afraid of comin‚Äô down

I don‚Äôt wanna say goodbye
But she can't get herself to stop
I know that it‚Äôll take some time
But im scared that might be something that we don't got
Now everybody knows it's somethin‚Äô
They see the writing on the wall
And she feels like she's flyin‚Äô
While we‚Äôre all watching her fall

She was the life of the party
She was the one everybody
Used to wanna hang around
I bet they wonder where she is now
I wish I woulda known
Before she was too far gone
I‚Äôm afraid to lose her now
She's afraid of comin‚Äô down

She's afraid of comin‚Äô down

Our first installment features a medley of 'Only' and 'Love The Heartless'. The boys and I played these things live without a click track and I hope y'all enjoy the change up. I've always felt making music was very therapeutic for me, and I hope someone who needs this hears it. 

We filmed these at the Amber Sound in Nashville, Tennessee.  I'm a sucker for a vibe in music ‚Äî that feeling when a sound completely shifts the mood of a room. This vibe was more like an indie rock house show than a studio, which left me feeling inspired. Let me know what y'all think in the comments below.

LYRICS: 
I threw my phone out of the window, I‚Äôm so over it
Weight on my shoulders, every day another storm to live
I‚Äôm standing at the ledge
My foot‚Äôs about to slide
What if it takes the fall for me to learn to fly
I try to run from what I‚Äôve done
And it cost me everyone, all it left me was feeling numb

Sunrise stayed up ‚Äòtil the morning
Eyes stay bloodshot from the smoking
Another round and I‚Äôm locked and loaded
Faith has faded
Living on the edge one foot in the coffin
Lord knows I don‚Äôt pray too often
Knees down when the devil come calling
Ain‚Äôt no saving

Dead man walking
A dead man walking

Russian roulette, I swear I don‚Äôt have many chances left
No I should change, but man I swear I‚Äôd rather dance with death
I‚Äôm just a desperate soul
Another broken human
I know some stars are falling
I know some stars are shooting
I get so high
I‚Äôm froze in time
Shattered pieces fell on the floor of a heart no longer pure

Sunrise stayed up ‚Äòtil the morning
Eyes stay bloodshot from the smoking
Another round and I‚Äôm locked and loaded
Faith has faded
Living on the edge one foot in the coffin
Lord knows I don‚Äôt pray too often
Knees down when the devil come calling
Ain‚Äôt no saving

Dead man walking
A dead man walking

I threw my phone out of the window I‚Äôm so over it
Weight on my shoulders every day another storm to live

Sunrise stayed up ‚Äòtil the morning
Eyes stay bloodshot from the smoking
Another round and I‚Äôm locked and loaded
Faith has faded
Living on the edge one foot in the coffin
Lord knows I don‚Äôt pray too often
Knees down when the devil come calling
Ain‚Äôt no saving

Dead man walking
A dead man walking
Ain‚Äôt no saving
Dead man walking
A dead man walking

[Verse I: Scrim]
I put hemis in my auto to speed up to my bardo
Da Vinci code my blood line
Paint ya face like Leonardo
Ima grey stepper
Off the 8th letter

More turnt than the Maury show when he say you are not the dad
G
Grey the gang stain a lame with the A
R
Relapsed off them bars before I nod I pop that
E
Enigma my stigmata baby momma hollering
Y
Young Christ baby I was sent here just to die

[Verse II: Germ]

Oxys in my Yerba Mate diet

raptor truck pulled hopped out with the cutter
barber with me he ain‚Äôt on the clock

rocks in my clock could‚Äôve bought me a yacht
neck look like the ocean
I need a lifeguard on god

[Verse III: Ruby]
stand my fucking ground
lil shawty tryna fuck me up
spinnin round and round
my head feel like tires on a bus
no fuck boys allowed
grey 59 is an exclusive club
it looks like i drowned
all these diamonds got quality cut
ruby such a mystery
dodging all these inquiries
blame my dope addiction all on made up abstract injuries

[Verse II: Ruby]
wasting my time might as well of stole the rollie
burnin big blunts

1000 thoughts at once and now i&#39;m focused
feelin atrocious
feel like provoking these hoes into chokin each other
im hopin i pick the right one
because one is a buffer
the other ones fucking nuts but i think that i might love her
im willing to suffer
im willing to give anything a try at least once
if i like it it‚Äôll be months before i see the fucking sun
and check the clock or ask the time

[Verse III: Scrim]
3 fingers 6 digits for the gang smoking swisher blunts
Ridin middle finger up
Residue stuck in my nose go (snort) and I get high as fuck
Blicky toys
We Greys R Us
Got my bitch on Angel dust
Grip my pistol while she sucking
For a hoe I got no trust
Call the doc
Slick going out his mind

Spraying in the air hollering kill em all
Slick baby off of that shit
Devil from outta that pit

Yea uh I been popping pills and sipping drop

Beating on my chest I feel like Kong
Lemme talk my shit it‚Äôs been too long
Plugged in like a socket
Up in space like a rocket
Glock tucked in my pocket
Choppa here it got bodies
Bought that bitch a new body
Crib came with a lobby
Rappers know I‚Äôm they papi
Sipping drank and rolling slow my bitch powder her nose
Haters mad and want me sad but my net worth said no
Mad cuz they still broke

[Verse I: Ruby]
i think tonight is a good night to die
spent most of my life tryna hide
i‚Äôve tried to see the whole world through a crack in the blinds
lost track of time
pull back the tide
isolating inside of the hive
ready to die
in hell i arrive
leave nothing behind but empty backwoods packs
raised by the last wolfpack
yung mutt in attack mode
taking off the sheep head mask
everything i touch turn ash and my whole soul burnt til its black
now i got horns on my head aint made out of brass
i got horns on my head like a certain zodiac

[Verse II: Scrim]
AK toting
Codeine toasting
Hoodlum from that Northside
Frequent overdoser
Im tip toeing right through hells fire
Break the law
Or break your jaw
Don‚Äôt any mother fucker come close to me
Fuck your cause
And fuck your boys
If you really wanna die then come try thee
Yung Christ
Yung Christ
Demons all around
You don‚Äôt wanna go outside
Knock knock at the door
Hey honey are you home?
You can hide but you gone die
Ride for the five
And I die for the nine
For my sin can‚Äôt atone
Mom raised a killer
Dad turned me gorilla
Ima Psycho down to the bone

[Verse III: Germ]
i don‚Äôt wanna be that nigga livin‚Äô no lie
i don‚Äôt wanna be on bad sides of .45‚Äôs
keep it on me no lie
keep it boppin‚Äô hold fire
mama told me keep it solid
boy these niggas fried
bitch on my dick
lemme beat them insides
i been that nigga
can‚Äôt see my demise
ride with the fire been the motto for some time
i def seen that text i‚Äôm just not gon‚Äô reply
GREY*59 army
right foot left
peanut butter seats i keep my lil bitch fed
i only see the money i must confess
i can‚Äôt rock with these niggas
bitch im pressed
bitch lemme flex
bitch i need checks
bitch i need neck
die for the set
pulled off in a jet
got a dub on my neck
niggas down bad i might buy the whole set",True,True,6741307.0,Not Found

Mama was queen of the mambo
Papa was king of the Congo
Deep down in the jungle
I started bangin' my first bongo
Every monkey'd like to be
In my place instead of me
Cause I'm the king of bongo, baby
I'm the king of bongo bong

I went to the big town
Where there is a lot of sound
From the jungle to the city
Looking for a bigger crown
So I play my boogie
For the people of big city
But they don't go crazy

When I'm bangin' in my boogie
I'm the...

""king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong""

Hear me when I come, baby
""king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong""

Nobody'd like to be in my place instead of me
Cause nobody go crazy when I'm bangin' on my boogie
I'm a king without a crown hanging loose in a big town
But I'm the king of bongo baby I'm the king of bongo bong

""King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong""
Hear me when I come baby

""King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong""
Hear me when I come

They say that I'm a clown
Making too much dirty sound
They say there is no place for little monkey in this town
Nobody'd like to be in my place instead of me
Cause nobody go crazy when I'm bangin' on my boogie
I'm the...

""King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong""
Hear me when I come baby
""King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong""
Hear me when I come

Bangin' on my bongo all that swing belongs to me
I'm so happy there's nobody in my place instead of me
I'm a king without a crown hanging loose in a big town
But I'm the king of bongo baby I'm the king of bongo bong

""King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong""
Hear me when I come baby
""King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong""
Hear me when I come

Mama was queen of the mambo
Papa was king of the Congo
Deep down in the jungle
I started bangin' my first bongo
Every monkey'd like to be

In my place instead of me
Cause I'm the king of bongo, baby

Lyrics: 
 
Me llaman el desaparecido
Cuando llega ya se ha ido
Volando vengo, volando voy
Deprisa deprisa rumbo perdido

Cuando me buscan nunca estoy
Cuando me encuentran yo no soy
El que est√° enfrente porque ya
Me fui corriendo m√°s all√°

Me dicen el desaparecido
Fantasma que nunca est√°
Me dicen el desagradecido
Pero esa no es la verdad
Yo llevo en e l cuerpo un dolor
Que no me deja respirar

Llevo en el cuerpo una condena
Que siempre me echa a camina

me dicen el desaparecido

Que cuando llega ya se ha ido
Volando vengo, volando voy
Deprisa deprisa rumbo perdido

Me dicen el desaparecido
Fantasma que nunca est√°
Me dicen el desagradecido
Pero esa no es la verdad
Yo llevo en el cuerpo un motor
Que nunca dejade rolar
Llevo en el alma un camino
Destinado a nunca llegar

Cuando me buscan nunca estoy

Cuando me encuentran yo no soy
El que est√° enfrente porque ya
Me fui corriendo m√°s all√°

Me dicen el desaparecido
Que cuando llega ya se ha ido
Volando vengo, volando voy
Deprisa deprisa rumbo perdido

Perdido en el siglo...
Perdido en el siglo...
Siglo veinte...
(cuando llegar√©)
Rumbo al veintiuno
(cuando llegar√©)

Me llaman el desaparecido
Perdido en el siglo

Me llaman el desaparecido
(cuando llegar√©)

Me dicen el desaparecido
Fantasma que nunca est√°
Me dicen el desagradecido
Esa no es la verdad
Yo llevo en el cuerpo un motor
Que nunca dejade rolar
Llevo en el alma un camino
Destinado a nunca llegar
Me llaman el desaparecido
Que cuando llega ya se ha ido
Volando vengo, volando voy
Deprisa deprisa rumbo perdido

Lyrics: 

Me llaman calle, pisando baldosa
La revoltosa y tan perdida
Me llaman calle
Calle de noche, calle de d√≠a

Me llaman calle
Hoy tan cansada, hoy tan vac√≠a
Como maquinita por la gran ciudad

Me llaman calle
Me subo a tu coche
Me llaman calle de malegr√≠a
Calle dolida, calle cansada de tanto amar

Voy calle abajo, voy calle arriba
No me rebajo ni por la vida
Me llaman calle y ese es mi orgullo
Yo s√© que un d√≠a llegar√°

Yo s√© que un d√≠a vendr√° mi suerte
Un d√≠a me vendr√° a buscar
A la salida, un hombre bueno
Pa' to' la vida y sin pagar
Mi coraz√≥n no es de alquilar

Me llaman calle, me llaman calle
Calle sufrida, calle tristeza de tanto amar
Me llaman calle, calle m√°s calle

Me llaman calle, la sin futuro
Me llaman calle, la sin salida
Me llaman calle, calle m√°s calle
La que mujeres de la vida
Suben pa'bajo, bajan pa'rriba
Como maquinita por la gran ciudad

Me llaman calle, me llaman calle
Calle sufrida, calle tristeza de tanto amar
Me llaman calle, calle m√°s calle

Me llaman siempre y a cualquier hora
Me llaman guapa, siempre a deshora
Me llaman puta, tambi√©n princesa
Me llaman calle, es mi nobleza

Me llaman calle, calle sufrida
Calle perdida de tanto amar
Me llaman calle, me llaman calle
Calle sufrida, calle tristeza de tanto amar

A la Puri, a la Carmen, Carolina, Viviana
Pereyra, Masa, Marga, Baby
Marcela, Jenny, Tatiana, Rudy, M√≥nica
Mar√≠a, Mar√≠a

Me llaman calle, (Carolina) me llaman calle
Calle sufrida, calle tristeza de tanto amar
Me llaman calle, (Carolina) me llaman calle
Calle sufrida, calle tristeza de tanto amar (A la Puri)

Me llaman calle, (Carolina) me llaman calle
Calle sufrida, calle tristeza de tanto amar
Me llaman calle, me llaman calle

M83 today shares a new video for ‚ÄúMy Tears Are Becoming A Sea.‚Äù A standout track from M83‚Äôs celebrated 2011 double album Hurry Up, We‚Äôre Dreaming, the video for ‚ÄúMy Tears Are Becoming A Sea‚Äù is a prequel to the record‚Äôs magical and captivating video trilogy comprised of ‚ÄúMidnight City,‚Äù ‚ÄúReunion,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWait.‚Äù Watch the video here.

The initial trilogy chronicled the adventures of supernatural children on the run from forces wishing to capture them in order to study their powers. This new video is directed by Sacha Barbin and Ryan Doubiago and produced by Division.

Reflecting on the prequel‚Äôs concept and revisiting the trilogy‚Äôs storyline, Barbin and Doubiago say, ‚Äúthis story takes place 10 years earlier in order to highlight the first moment one of these children uses their supernatural gifts. On the way to the hospital and moments before his birth, the child‚Äôs parents are victims of a horrible car accident. The unborn child is forced to use his powers to save them from within the womb. The idea was to show the literal birth of a superhero. We wanted to place this story in a realistic and universal setting. We think that the panic created by this magnificent moment speaks to everyone. We also wanted to pay homage to the mothers who are too often absent from the mythology of superheroes. And finally, to go beyond the codes of the genre to carry a symbolic message of hope where future generations would come to save us from a dark fate.‚Äù

Knife + Heart, a French film directed by Yann Gonzalez ‚Äì¬†the brother of M83 frontman Anthony Gonzalez ‚Äì premiered at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.

Knife + Heart is a noir-tinged erotic slasher that explores the seedy underbelly of Paris in the 1970s. Vanessa Paradis stars as Anne, the producer of third-rate gay pornography who strives to win back
the affections of Lois ‚Äì her editor and erstwhile lover ‚Äì¬†by shooting her most ambitious film yet. But events take a violent and dark turn when one after another, Anne‚Äôs actors fall prey to a masked killer
whose bloodlust knows no bounds. Watch the trailer for Knife + Heart here: http://m83.it/knifehearttrailerYo

‚ñ∫ LYRICS:
I don‚Äôt fuckin know if it‚Äôs a lie or it‚Äôs a fact
All your little fake friends will sell your secrets for some cash
Smile in my face then put your cig out on my back
If you ever see me just get to runnin like the flash

I knew a boy just like you
He‚Äôs a snake just like you
Such a fake just like you
But I can see the truth

Transparent soul
I can see right through just so you know

Transparent soul
I can see right through just so you know

I don‚Äôt fuckin know it‚Äôs paradise or it‚Äôs a trap
Yeah, they‚Äôre treating me like royalty but is it kissin ass
No one‚Äôs brave enough to take the fall right
But it‚Äôs all your fault
Why you actin like it‚Äôs alright

I knew a girl just like you
She was vain just like you
Such a pain just like you but I can see the truth

Transparent soul
I can see right through just so you know

Transparent soul
I can see right through just so you know

It‚Äôs clear to me know
You‚Äôre scared of me wow
It‚Äôs clear to me now
(Transparent soul)

It‚Äôs clear to me know
You‚Äôre scared of me wow
It‚Äôs clear to me now
(Transparent soul)

Transparent soul
I can see right through just so you know

Transparent soul
I can see right through just so you know
