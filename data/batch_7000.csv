●  Lyrics
Life is a paradise
Oooh yeah!

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight
I'm a prisoner of hope I know

I believe life could be paradise once again
And the love we thought we lost is sleeping within
Close your eyes, it's something for you

Lucky Love....

We are young and we are old we're fallen like leaves
And your heart's so full of soul it makes me believe
Once again, it's something for you

Lucky Love...

The bridge over time was what she need to see the light
to see the light whoo yeah

Lucky Love...",True,True,5505208.0,synth-pop

Lyrics: 

I could hardly believe it
When I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin'
Someone's swept your heart away
From the look upon your face, I see it's true
So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the
plans you're makin'
Then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been lovin' you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
How am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone",True,True,188138505.0,rock music

Can't keep his mind on nothin' else

Che gli amanti si allontanano l'uno dall'altro e che così va l'amore   
Un amore così bello, un amore così libero   
Un amore così bello, un amore per me e te",False,False,27342907.0,pop rock

Lyrics: 

How can we be lovers if we can't be friends
How can we start over when the fighting never ends
Baby, how can we make love if we can't make amends
Tell me how we can be lovers if we can't be,
can't be friends

Look at us now, look at us baby
Still tryin' to work it out
Never get it right
We must be fools, we must be crazy
Whoa, whoa, when there's no
communication
Whao, Whoa, it's a no win situation",True,True,27049776.0,rock music

Lyrics: 

Talk about love, talk about trust
Talkin' 'bout forever baby
When I'm talkin' 'bout us
I give you my word, stick to my guns
Believe when I tell ya baby
That we've just begun

Lyrics:

Birds fly, they don't think twice
They simply spread their wings
The sun shines, it don't ask why
Or what the whole thing means

The same applies to you and I
We never question that
So good, it's just understood
Ain't no conjecture
Just a matter of fact

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again
Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love is a wonderful thing",True,True,5214805.0,pop rock

Lyrics:
Yeah, uh! Get up now! Ow! Knock out this!
Super highways, coast to coast, easy to get anywhere
On the transcontinental overload, just slide behind the wheel
How does it feel

When theres no destination-that's too far
And somewhere on the way, you might find out who you are

Livin' in America-eye to eye, station to station
Livin' in America-hand to hand,across the nation
Livin in America-got to have a celebration

Rock my soul

Smokestack, fatback,many miles of railroad track
All night radio, keep on runnin' through, your rock 'n' roll soul
All night diners, keep you 'wake, on black coffee, and a hard roll

You might have to walk the fine line,
you might take the hard line
But everybody's workin' overtime

Livin' in America-eye to eye, station to station
Livin' in America-hand to hand,across the nation
Livin in America-got to have a celebration

I live in America, help me out,
but I live in America,
wait a minute
You may not be looking for the promise land,
but you might find it anyway
Under one of those old familiar names
Like New Orleans (New Orleans) Detroit City (Detroit City), Dallas (Dallas), Pittsburg P.A. (Pittsburg P.A.) New York City (New York City)Kansas City (Kansas City)Atlanta (Atlanta) CHICAGO & L.A.!

Livin in America-hit me
Livin in America-yeah,
I walk in and out 
Livin' in America

I live in America-state lines,
gonna make the prime, that
I live in America-hey
I know what it means,I

Livin' in America...
Livin' in America- hit me now, eye to eye, station to station
Livin' in America
Livin' in America-I feel good!",False,False,51518418.0,figure

An abbreviated single version was released reaching number one on the Pop Standard chart and was named Record of the Year in 1965. The album won the 1965 Grammy Awards for Best Album of the Year, Best Jazz Instrumental Album - Individual or Group and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. The personel are Stan Getz - tenor saxophone, João Gilberto - guitar, vocals, Astrud Gilberto -- vocals, Antonio Carlos Jobim - piano, Sebastião Neto -- bass, and Milton Banana - drums. The version presented here is the long one from the album and is, in my opinion, superior to the shortened one which received a great deal of play on the radio during the summer of 1964.

On heavenly rain, you fell into my life
Unforgettable smile, unforgettable lies
In the name of the cross or a banner of love
With the hand of a friend or under a blanket of trust
The angels sighed, a little girl cried
The tears run rings around my eyes
We're going to set fire to the house in my heart
We're going to set fire to the whole damn world
I don't understand the wicked things we do
In the name of the good, in the name of the few
Don't look at me with your innocent smile
When the bed is burning around my head
When a war breaks out, It'll be no surprise
Your unforgettable smile, your unforgettable lies
And I've got to stop running to make my start
We've got to get together before we fall apart
They're pulling down the old slums to build the new
They're bringing back the old rules to please the few
Pull down the old slums to build the new
Pull down the love I built with you
Promise of tomorrow you never kept
And you try to burn the house down when I slept
The nation's in disorder, there's chaos in my heart
We've got to get together before we fall apart",False,False,832412.0,punk rock

Ôba, lá vem ela
Estou de olho nela

Não me importo que ela não me olhe
Não diga nada e nem saiba que eu existo
Quem eu sou, pois eu sei muito bem quem é ela
E fico contente só em ver ela passar

Ôba, lá vem ela
Estou de olho nela

A noite é linda e ela mais ainda
Todinha de rosa
Mais linda, mais meiga
Que uma rosa

Ôba, lá vem ela
Estou de olho nela

Não me importo que falem que pensem
Pois sem saber ela é minha alegria
Ela tem um perfume de uma flor que eu não sei o nome
Mas ela deve ter um nome bonito igual a ela

Ôba, lá vem ela
Estou de olho nela

It's just the sun that's shinin' in your eyes.
It's just the moon that is the sun's disguise.
Just the sky, with clouds a blowin' by.
The sun and the moon and the sky, and you and I.

It's just the rain that's rollin' down my cheek.
It's just the wind that makes me hear you speak.
It's just the song that anyone can sing.
The rain and the wind and the song and the love you bring.

It's just the world that gonna break your heart.
It's just the past that's tearin' us apart.
It's just the time we have so little of.
The world and the past and the time that we fell in love.

It's just the sun that's shinin' in your eyes

The Gala stands out with a festive and energetic program: the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of Simon Rattle performs a variety of dances by Brahms, Dvořák, Strauss and Stravinsky live at the Philharmonie, Berlin.

Paintings by - Franz Richard Unterberger (1838 - 1902)
Franz Richard Unterberger (1838 - 1902) was a landscape painter who was born in Innsbruck 15th August 1838. Unterberger specialised in studies of Venice and his paintings are now avidly collected. Unterberger first trained at the Academy in Munich and subsequently he moved to Weimar where he studied under Albert Zimmermann. Unterberger's training concluded with a period of study in Dusseldorf under Andreas Achenbach. Unterberger was a great traveller and he spent time in many European countries. In 1859, Unterberger enrolled at the Dusseldorf Academy where he joined the Achenbach brothers, who became famous for their landscape paintings. Unterberger visited Norway in 1860 with Andreas Achenbach and later frequently returned to Norway and Denmark, as well as making several trips to the coasts of England and Scotland. Unterberger settled in Brussels in 1864, where he spent the rest of his life. During this period, he usually spent the summer at Neuilly-sur-Seine, from where he often visited Venice, South Italy and Sicily. Unterberger painted many of his most successful paintings during these trips. Unterberger paintings convey the views which captivated his artistic interest and they often record busy scenes of daily life. Unterberger eventually settled in Brussels and he exhibited in a number of major Academies in Vienna, Paris and London. Unterberger paintings are highly romantic with a characteristic delicacy of colouring and superb ability to capture the bustle and atmosphere of a famous location. Unterberger's studies of Venice and the Neopolitan coast are now considered his most desirable paintings. Unterberger paintings can be seen in a number of European Museums. These include Louviers, Gallerie Roussel (Amalfi, Gulf of Salerno), Troyes (The Isle of Capri), and Melbourne, Australia (Gulf of Salermo).

Song lyrics : 

Com'è triste Venezia soltanto un anno dopo
Com'è triste Venezia se non si ama più
Si cercano parole, che nessuno dirà
E si vorrebbe piangere e non si può più.

Com'è triste Venezia se nella barca c'è
Soltanto un gondoliere che guarda verso te
E non ti chiede niente, perché negli occhi tuoi
E dentro la tua mente c'è solamente lei.

Com'è triste Venezia soltanto un anno dopo
Com'è triste Venezia se non si ama più
I musei e le chiese si aprono per noi
Ma non lo sanno che oramai non ci sei.

Com'è triste Venezia di sera la laguna
Se si cerca una mano che non si trova più
Si fa dell'ironia, davanti a quella luna
Che un dì ti ha vista mia e non ti vede più.

Addio gabbiani in volo, che un giorno salutaste
Due punti neri al suolo addio anche da lei
Troppo triste Venezia, soltanto un anno dopo
Troppo triste Venezia, se non si ama più..

......

Paroles :

Que c’est triste Venise au temps des amours mortes 
Que c’est triste Venise quand on ne s’aime plus 
On cherche encore des mots mais l’ennui les emporte 
On voudrait bien pleurer mais on ne le peut plus 
Que c’est triste Venise lorsque les barcarolles 
Ne viennent souligner que des silences creux 
Et que le cœur se serre en voyant les gondoles 
Abriter le bonheur des couples amoureux

Que c’est triste Venise au temps des amours mortes 
Que c’est triste Venise quand on ne s’aime plus 
Les musées, les églises ouvrent en vain leurs portes 
Inutile beauté devant nos yeux déçus 
Que c’est triste Venise le soir sur la lagune
Quand on cherche une main que l’on ne vous tend pas 
Et que l’on ironise devant le clair de lune 
Pour tenter d’oublier ce qu’on ne se dit pas
Adieu tous les pigeons qui nous ont fait escorte 
Adieu Pont des soupirs adieu rêves perdus 
C’est trop triste Venise au temps des amours mortes 
C’est trop triste Venise quand on ne s’aime plus

Paroles :

J’ai travaillé 
Des années 
Sans répit 
Jour et nuit 
Pour réussir 
Pour gravir 
Les sommets 
En oubliant 
Souvent dans 
Ma course contre le temps 
Mes amis, mes amours, mes emmerdes 

À corps perdu 
J’ai couru 
Assoiffé 
Obstiné 
Vers l’horizon 
L’illusion 
Vers l’abstrait 
En sacrifiant 
C’est navrant 
Je m’en accuse à présent 
Mes amis, mes amours, mes emmerdes

Mes amis c’était tout en partage 
Mes amours faisaient très bien l’amour 
Mes emmerdes étaient ceux de notre âge 
Où l’argent, c’est dommage 
Éperonnait nos jours

Pour être fier 
Je suis fier 
Entre nous 
Je l’avoue 
J’ai fait ma vie 
Mais il y a un mais 
Je donnerai
Ce que j’ai 
Pour retrouver, je l’admets 
Mes amis, mes amours, mes emmerdes



Mes relations vraiment, sont 
Haut placées, décorées 
Très influents
Bedonnants
Des gens bien 
Ils sont sérieux 
Mais près d’eux 
J’ai toujours le regret de 
Mes amis, mes amours, mes emmerdes

Mes amis étaient pleins d’insouciance 
Mes amours avaient le corps brûlant 
Mes emmerdes aujourd’hui quand j’y pense 
Avaient peu d’importance 
Et c’était le bon temps

Les canulars 
Les pétards 
Les folies 
Les orgies 
Les jours du bac 
Le cognac 
Les refrains 
Tout ce qui fait 
Je le sais 
Que je n’oublierai jamais 
Mes amis, mes amours, mes emmerdes

“I was the first to write a song in France about homosexuality,” he says. “I wanted to write about the specific problems my gay friends faced. I could see things were different for them, that they were marginalized.”
 
The song’s lyrics describe the life of a gay man, his crossdressing at Paris clubs by night, his close relationship to his mother. “I always wrote about things that others might not have written about. We don’t mind frank language in books, the theatre or cinema, but for some reason still to sing about such things is seen as odd.”

It has since then become a classic, sung in English as ""What Makes a Man a Man"", by artists such as

Bye Bye
Llévame a la estación, espero que te vuelva a ver...
Ya no puedo evitar esta sensación de soledad
Si así es como quierés, yo me iré, muy muy lejos
Si así es como lo ves, sólamente te pido algo

Déjame, déjame que te toque la piel
Déjame, déjame que yo te pueda ver

Te diré sólo adiós, no sé cuanto hacía que no estaba bien...
A veces buscás, a veces ganás y otras perdés
Entonces quieres ver una luz en la noche...
Buscando una razón, para un corazón hecho pedazos

Déjame, déjame que yo toque la piel
Déjame, déjame que yo te pueda ver...
Déjame, déjame que yo pruebe tu miel
Déjame, déjame que te toque otra vez

Auto Rojo letra

Te busqué en mi auto rojo a las 6 
llevaba un frac muy nuevo 
que en verdad no me quedaba muy bien 
te llevé por la ruta que va a al sur 
nene no vas rápido 
dijiste mirando me extrañada 
Te confesé que quiero 
meterte en mi cama 
viéndote sonreír de placer 
te prometí que solo 
tocaría tus pies 
si empañamos los vidrios 
esta bien
Ahora hace calor 
la música suena bastante bien 
te juré por mi amor 
que atrás la vamos a pasar mejor
Ahora hace calor 
la música suena bastante bien 
te juré por mi amor 
que atrás la vamos a pasar mejor
Soñaba ver tu pecho tatuado 
debajo de tu collar 
que en verdad tengo ganas de arrancar 
te toqué por la línea que va al sur 
puede ser mas rápido 
te dije mirándote exaltado
Te confesé que quiero 
meterte en mi cama 
viéndote…",True,True,79649697.0,Not Found

Haces muy mal, 
En elevar mi tensión 
En aplastar mi ambición 
Tu sigue así ya verás 

Miro el reloj, 
Es mucho más tarde que ayer 
Te esperaría otra vez 
Y no lo haré, y no lo haré

ABOUT 1917
Set at the height of the First World War, 1917 centers on two young British soldiers, Schofield (Captain Fantastic’s George MacKay) and Blake (Game of Thrones’ Dean-Charles Chapman), who are given a seemingly impossible mission. In a race against time, they must cross enemy territory and deliver a message that will stop a deadly attack on hundreds of soldiers—Blake’s own brother among them.

Parco Novi Sad, Modena, Italy

1 June 1999

Composers : Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie

One of Luciano Pavarotti's best concerts with his friends : Joe Cocker, B.B. King, Mariah Carey, Lionel Richie, Zucchero, Laura Pausini, Ricky Martin, Gloria Estefan, Alex Britti, Renato Zero, Gianni Morandi and Boyzone

Lyrics :

(Lionel Richie)
There comes the time 
When we head a certain call 
When the world must come together as one 
There are people dying 
Ooo,it's time to lend a hand to life 
The greatest gift of all 

(Gloria Estefan)
We can't go on 
Pretending day by day 
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change 

(Joe Cocker)
We are all a part of 
God's great family 

(Zucchero)
And the truth, love is all we need 

Chorus :

We are the world 
We are the children 
We are the ones who make a brighter day 
So let's start giving 
There's a choice we're making 
We're saving our own lives 
It's true we'll make a better day 
Just you and me 

(Lionel Richie)
Oooo,send them your heart 
So they'll know that someone cares 

(Renato Zero)
And their lives will be stronger and free 

(Ricky Martin)
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread 
So we all must lend a helping hand 

Chorus x 1

(Boyzone)
Now when you're down and out
 
(Gloria Estefan)
There seems no hope at all 

(Boyzone)
But if you just believe 
There's no way we can fall 

(Laura Pausini)
No,no,no,just realize 
O.that a change will only come 
When we stand together as one

La Donna È Mobile - Giuseppe Verdi

La donna è mobile
Qual piuma al vento
Muta d'accento
E di pensiero

Sempre un'amabile
Leggiadro viso
In pianto o in riso
È menzognero

La donna è mobil
Qual piuma al vento
Muta d'accento
E di pensier
E di pensier
E di pensier

È sempre misero
Chi a lei s'affida
Chi le confida
Mal cauto il core

Pur mai non sentesi
Felice appieno
Chi su quel seno
Non liba amore
