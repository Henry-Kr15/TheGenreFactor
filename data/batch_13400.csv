Maritim gibt es endlich auf Instagram!! 
Viele Neuigkeiten, Details und Hintergrund-Informationen zu all unseren Hörspielen - am besten gleich abonnieren, damit euch nichts mehr entgeht!! 

Die nächste Folge der offiziellen Fortsetzung der Maritim-Originale von „Sherlock Holmes“: 
„Sherlock Holmes - die neuen Fälle"", ebenfalls mit dem genialen Sprecher-Gespann Christian Rode und Peter Groeger, produziert von Romantruhe Audio und All Score Media (Regie: Gerd Naumann), als komplettes Hörspiel! 
Die beliebteste ""Sherlock Holmes""-Audioserie überhaupt gibt es als ""Sherlock Holmes - Die Originale"", ""Sherlock Holmes - die alten Fälle (Reloaded)"" und ""Sherlock Holmes - die neuen Fälle"". 
Alle Serien davon gibt es überall digital (als Download & Stream)! 
""Die Originale"" und ""die neuen Fälle"" auch auf CD. 

Auf Wunsch von Spotify mussten viele Verlage (darunter auch Maritim) ihren Katalog aufgrund veränderter Anlieferungs-Spezifikationen austauschen. Die neuen Produkte sind bereits alle verfügbar.
Das hat aber leider den kurzfristigen Effekt, dass viele Playlists nicht mehr funktionieren. Wir würden euch daher bitten, die Produkte bis auf weiteres manuell zu suchen…

There aren’t many drum and bass artists who have developed a sound as recognisable as Millbrook in the space of two years. From the distinct shuffle of his drums, to those famous bass growls that initially took the scene by storm on “Rituals”, Millbrook has consistently impressed with his unique take on dancefloor D&B. The artist’s latest release on Elevate is no different. Featuring the immense vocal talents of Flowdan – whose career flourished as a member of the Roll Deep crew – “Power” is a track rolling back time to the MC-driven jump up sound that initially hooked Millbrook on D&B in the first place. It’s a track every DJ needs in their toolbox!

After the success of Millbrook’s debut Elevate release “Green Light” (ft. Cara Islay) back in May, we couldn’t wait to get the artist back on the label. He has already shown what he’s capable of for labels including Viper Recordings, Ram Records and Deadbeats, but we guarantee there’s plenty more dancefloor surprises to come.

You and me we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can’t believe you let me down
But the proof’s in the way it hurts

For months on end I’ve had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I’m crazy
Cos you don’t think I know what you’ve done
But when you call me baby
I know I’m not the only one
You’ve been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though lord knows you kept mine
You say I’m crazy
Cos you don’t think I know what you’ve done
But when you call me baby
I know I’m not the only one

I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You’ve made me realise my deepest fear
But lying and tearing us up

You say I’m crazy
Cos you don’t think I know what you’ve done
But when you call me baby
I know I’m not the only one

You say I’m crazy
Cos you don’t think I know what you’ve done
But when you call me baby
I know I’m not the only one
I know I’m not the only one
I know I’m not the only one

And I know, And I know, And I know, And I know, And I know,
And I know, know
I know I’m not the only one

Guess it’s true
I’m not good
At a one night stand
But I still need love
Cos I’m just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don’t want you to leave
Will you hold my hand

Oh won’t you
Stay with me
Cos you’re
All I need
This aint love
It’s clear to see
But darling
Stay with me

Why am I so emotional?
No it’s not a good look
Gain some self control
Deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me
So it doesn’t hurt

Oh won’t you
Stay with me
Cos you’re
All I need
This aint love
It’s clear to see
But darling
Stay with me
Oh won’t you

You must think that I’m stupid
You must think that I’m a fool
You must think that I’m new to this
But I have seen this all before

I’m never going to let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up it hurts
So I’m never going to get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby we don’t stand a chance, it’s sad but it’s true
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you’ll see me cry (No way that you’ll see me cry)
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)

I know you’re thinking I’m heartless
I know you’re thinking I’m cold
I’m just protecting my innocence
I’m just protecting my soul

I’m never going to let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
‘Cause every time I open up it hurts
So I’m never going to get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby we don’t stand a chance, it’s sad but it’s true
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you’ll see me cry (No way that you’ll see me cry)
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)

No…
(I’m way too good at goodbyes)
(I’m way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you’ll see me cry)
Oh…
(I’m way too good at goodbyes)

‘Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry

He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be a preacher when your soul is damned
He could be a lawyer on a witness stand but
He'll never love you like I can, can

He could be a stranger you gave a second glance
He could be a trophy of a one night stand
He could have your humour but I don’t understand cos
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
They'll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can

A chance encounter of circumstance
Maybe he’s a mantra keeps your mind entranced
He could be the silence in this mayhem, but then again
He'll never love you like I can, can

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
They'll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can, can

We both have demons, that we can't stand
I love your demons like devils can
If you’re self-seeking an honest man
Then stop deceiving, lord please

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but

Lyrics:

Gimmegimmegimme… what I want, what I want 
Gimmegimmegimme… what I want, what I want 

Want, everything I want 
Is everything you got 
So knock before you come, over 
Relax, walk before you run 

Your eyes on my dun dun dun dun  
I need you to come, closer 

Voyeurs are watching us 
Giving me such a rush 
When I’m crazy and drunk on love 
Gimme what I want, gimme what I want, yeah 
 
Gimmegimmegimme… what I want, what I want 
Gimmegimmegimme… what I want, what I want 

Oh when mi pull up in a place yuh fi see mi see mi 
Got what mi want and what yuh got yuh better gimme gimme 
Mi rock yuh body ooh suh go rock yuh body fi mi 
Come over yah so may mi push yuh body to the limit 
Let me know, give me what I need 
I follow, I let you lead 
Give me love, don’t need no money  
So pull me closer actually 

Voyeurs are watching us 
Giving me such a rush 
When I’m crazy and drunk on love, love 
Gimme what I want, gimme what I want 

Gimmegimmegimme… what I want, what I want 
Gimmegimmegimme… what I want, what I want 

Voyeurs are watching us 
Giving me such a rush 
When I’m crazy and drunk on love, love 
Gimme what I want, gimme what I want 

Gimmegimmegimme… what I want, what I want 
Gimmegimmegimme… what I want, what I want

Lyrics:
Everybody’s looking for somebody, for somebody to take home
I’m not the exception, I’m a blessing of a body to love on

If you want it bad tonight
Come by me and drop a line
Put your aura into mine
Don’t be scared if you like it
I could fill you up with life
I could ease your appetite
Know you’ve never been this high
Don’t be scared if you like it

‘Cause I’m not here to make friends
No I’m not here to make friends
‘Cause I’m not here to make friends
I need a lover, I need a lover

I’m just being honest, baby I just need a partner when the lights come on
Thirty almost got me and I’m so over love songs, yeah

So if you want it bad tonight
Come by me and drop a line
Know you’ve never been this high
Don’t be scared if you like it

‘Cause I’m not here to make friends
No I’m not here to make friends

‘Cause I’m not here to make friends
I need a lover, I need a lover

I need a la la la la la la la la la
I need a la la la la la la la la la
I need a la la la la la la la la la
I need a lover, I need a lover

Everybody’s looking for somebody, for somebody to take home
I’m not the exception, I’m a blessing of a body to love on

‘Cause I’m not here to make friends
No I’m not here to make friends

‘Cause I’m not here to make friends

I need a lover, I need a lover
I need a la la la la la la la la la
I need a la la la la la la la la la
I need a la la la la la la la la la

I need a lover, I need a lover
I need a la la la la la la la la la
I need a la la la la la la la la la
I need a la la la la la la la la la
I need a lover, I need a lover

My mother said I’m too romantic
She said ‘You’re dancing in the movies’
I only started to believe her
Then I saw you and I knew
Maybe it’s ‘cause I got a little bit older
Maybe it’s all that I’ve been through
I’d like to think it’s how you lean on my shoulder
And how I see myself with you
I don’t say a word
But still you take my breath and steal the things I know
There you go
Saving me from out of the cold
Fire on fire
Would normally kill us
But this much desire
Together we’re winners
They say that we’re out of control
And some say we’re sinners
But don’t let them ruin
Our beautiful rhythms
‘Cause when you unfold me
And tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection
My only direction
It’s fire on fire
It’s fire on fire
When we fight, we fight like lions
But then we love and feel the truth
We lose our minds in a city of roses
We won’t abide by any rules
I don’t say a word
But still you take my breath and steal the things I know
There you go
Saving me from out of the cold
Fire on fire
Would normally kill us
But this much desire
Together we’re winners
They say that we’re out of control
And some say we’re sinners
But don’t let them ruin
Our beautiful rhythms
‘Cause when you unfold me
And tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection
My only direction
It’s fire on fire
Oh
It’s fire on fire
Fire on fire
Would normally kill us
But this much desire
Together we’re winners
They say that we’re out of control
And some say we’re sinners
But don’t let them ruin
Our beautiful rhythms
Fire on fire
Would normally kill us
But this much desire
Together we’re winners
They say that we’re out of control
And some say we’re sinners
But don’t let them ruin
Our beautiful rhythms
‘Cause when you unfold me
And tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection
My only direction
It’s fire on fire
You are perfection
My only direction

Lyrics:

Are you drunk enough 
Not to judge what I’m doing 
Are you high enough
To excuse that I’m ruined
Cause I’m ruined 
Is it late enough
For you to come and stay over
Cause we’re free to love
So tease me 

I make no promises
I can’t do golden rings
But I’ll give you everything
(Tonight)

Magic is in the air
There ain’t no science here
So come get your everything
(Tonight) 

I make no promises
I can’t do golden rings
But I’ll give you everything
(Tonight)

Magic is in the air
There ain’t no science here
So come get your everything
(Tonight) 
Tonight 

Is it loud enough
Cause my body is calling for ya
Calling for ya
I need someone
To do the things that I do
I’m heating up
Energy’s taking control
I’m speeding up
My heartbeat’s dancing alone

I make no promises
I can’t do golden rings
But I’ll give you everything
(Tonight)

Magic is in the air
There ain’t no science here
So come get your everything
(Tonight)

I make no promises
I can’t do golden rings
But I’ll give you everything
(Tonight)

Magic is in the air
There ain’t no science here
So come get your everything
(Tonight)
Tonight

Cause I need
Your green light 
Day and night 
Say that you’re mine

Cause I need
Your green light
Day and night
Say that you’re mine

I make no promises
I can’t do golden rings
But I’ll give you everything
(Tonight)

Magic is in the air
There ain’t no science here
So come get your everything
(Tonight)

I make no promises
I can’t do golden rings
But I’ll give you everything

Lyrics:
There ain’t no gold
In this river
That I’ve been washing my hands in forever
I know there is hope
In these waters
But I can’t bring myself to swim 
When I am drowning 
In this silence baby let me in
 
Go easy on me baby
I was still a child
Didn’t get the chance to 
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me
 
There ain’t no room 
For things to change
When we are both so deeply 
Stuck in our ways
You can’t deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was
To put you both first
But now I give up 
 
I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn’t even show

Lyrics
I ain’t got too much time to spare
But I’ll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I’m still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy you give good love I won’t lie
It’s what keeps me coming back even though I’m terrified
 
I know that it’s wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm yeah
Hmm yeah
 
Oh my god I can’t believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of
Jumping out of my life
And into your arms
Maybe baby I’m just losing my mind
Cause this is trouble
But it feels right teetering on the edge
Of heaven and hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight
 
I’m a fool but they all think I’m blind
I’d rather be a fool than leave myself behind
I don’t have to explain myself to you
I am a grown woman and I do what I want to do
 
Lord don’t let me
I said lord don’t let me
I said lord don’t let me let me down

Lyrics 
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you’ll never have my heart",True,True,351150894.0,action thriller

Lyrics
How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?
How come we’ve both become a version of a person we don’t even like? 
We’re in love with the world but the world just wants to bring us down
By putting ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow 
When I was a child every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun but now I only soak up wine
They say to play hard you work hard find balance in the sacrifice 
Yet I don’t know anybody who’s truly satisfied
 
You better believe I’m trying to keep climbing
But the higher we climb feels like we’re both none the wiser
 
So I hope I learn to get over myself 
Stop trying to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants something, you just want me
 
Why am I obsessing about the things I can’t control?
Why am I seeking approval from people I don’t even know? 
In these crazy times I hope to find something I can cling on to 
Cause I need some substance in my life
Something real, something that feels true
 
You better believe for you I’ve cried high tides
Cause I want you so bad but you can’t fight fire with fire 
 
Listen I know how low I can go 
I give as good as I get
You get the brunt of it all cause you’re all I’ve got left
Oh I hope in time we both will find peace of mind
Sometimes the road less travelled is a road best left behind

Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the booth into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, it's so comedic
At least I had it (Uh) instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)

[Chorus]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
(Two, three, go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

[Post-Chorus]
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2]
I know love is all I got
I just hope to God she got the taste
To put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me

[Chorus]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

[Bridge]
Kept it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
Kept it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
Keep it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (Going)
And now I'm scarred for life

[Interlude]
My love is gone (Gone), my love is gone (Gone)
My love is gone (It's gone), my love is gone

[Verse 3]
Ayo, there's poison in that gumbo
Emotion for Dumbo
Ask me where my luck go
That bitch walked outside the front door
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesser talk, see the
Weatherman told me that it was raining
My stupid ass brought an umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and feel better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and illusion because I jet to conclusion
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood her fluent
She opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started building a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my building got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)

[Outro]
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul

[Part II: THANK YOU]

[Chorus]
Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy
But I will never want to fall in love again
Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, oh
But I don't ever want to fall in love again

[Bridge]
(Got my eye)
I said go, go

[Chorus]
Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy
But I will never want to fall in love again (Again)
Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, oh
But I don't ever want to fall in love again

Disco in France, smell some perfume, head in the wind (In the wind)
We can switch off
I can show you how you can really exfoliate skin
If you got a man, you should cut him off
Get your passport 'cause we runnin' off (Run off)
We can sit and talk

Your body compared to the fashion
I hope you ain't proud of the shit that I bought (Baby)

I am very proud to share with you guys my graduating film thesis project at The Los Angeles Film School.

 It was an amazing experience and I send a big thank you to everyone who took part in making this visual come true. I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it with my amazing team and crew!



and of course this video would not be possible without Lady Gaga, thank you for redefining music videos and making music that fuels the creative mind.

Lyrics:
She’s alright
(She’s alright, that girl’s alright)
That girl’s alright with me
Yeah
 
Ay, yo
 
I can lick it, I can ride it
While you slippin and sliding
I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it
You can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me lone he always tell me he miss it
He want a
F-R-EEEEE-A-K
F-R-EEEEE-A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K
EEEEE-A-K,
F-R-EEEEE-A-K
 
Ok, one thing about me, I’m the baddest alive
He know the prettiest bitch didn’t come until I ARRIVE
I don’t let bitches get to me; I fuck they man if they try
I got a princess face, a killer body, samurai mind
They can’t be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I’ll go for a dive
His ex bitch went up against me, but she didn’t survive
On applications I write pressure, ‘cause that’s what I apply (Brrrr)
P P P Pressure applied, can’t fuck a regular guy
Wetter than umbrellas and stickier than Apple Pie
 
I can lick it, I can ride it
While you slipping and sliding
I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it
You can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me ‘lone he always tell me he miss it
He want a
F-R-EEEEE-A-K
F-R-EEEEE-A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K
EEEEE-A-K,
F-R-EEEEE-A-K
 
‘Cause what the fuck, this ain’t Chanel, nigga, custom down?
Like, what the fuck, this ain’t Burberry, custom brown?
He said, “Could you throw it back while you touch the ground?”
Then he said, “Do that pussy purr?”
I said, “Yup, meow”
Hold up
Fuck boys, ain’t no need for you to roll up
Ain’t no need for you to double tap neither, scroll up
Keep these bitches on they toes like Manolo
Be on the lookout when I come through, BOLO
Oh, whoa 
Elegant  bitch with a 
hoe glow
If it ain’t big, then I won’t blow
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Fuck is the tea?
I just F’d a G
Made him say “Uhh”, just ask Master P
Ball so hard, I just took a knee
Get me Rocky A$AP, nigga, word to RIH
 
Freak
F-f-freak
Some GYAL A FREAK
GYAL AH  FREAK
GYAL AH freak, freak, freak
 
I can lick it, I can ride it
While you slipping and sliding 
I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it
You can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me ‘lone he always tell me he miss it
He want a
F-R-EEEEE-A-K
F-R-EEEEE-A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K
EEEEE-A-K,
F-R-EEEEE-A-K

Lyrics:

¿Qué pasa contigo? Dímelo
Rrr!
O-O-Ovy on the Drums! (Mmm)

Ya no tiene excusa (No, no)
Hoy salió con su amiga dizque pa' matar la tusa (Ah; tusa)
Que porque un hombre le pagó mal (Ah)
Está dura y abusa (Eh)
Se cansó de ser buena
Ahora es ella quien los usa (Hmm-mm)
Que porque un hombre le pagó mal (Mal)
Ya no se le ve sentimental (-tal)
Dice que por otro man no llora, no (Llora)

Pero si le ponen la canción (Hmm)
Le da una depresión tonta
Llorando lo comienza a llamar
Pero él la dejó en buzón (-zón)
¿Será porque con otra está (Con otra está)
¿Fingiendo que a otra se puede amar?

Pero hice todo este llanto por nada
Ahora soy una chica mala
And now you kickin' and screamin', a big toddler
Don't try to get your friends to come holla, holla (Holla)
Ayo (Kyuh!), I used to lay low (Uh-huh)
I wasn't in the clubs, I was on my J.O. (Oop!)
Until I realized you a epic fail, yo
So don't tell your guys that I'm still your bae, yo (Ah!)
'Cause it's a new day, I'm in a new place (Uh-huh)
Gettin' some new D, sittin' on a new face (Okay)
'Cause I know I'm the baddest bitch that you ever really met (Oop!)
You searchin' for a badder bitch, and you ain't met her yet (Oop!)
Ayo! Tell 'em to back off, he wanna slack off
Ain't no more booty calls, you gotta jack off
It's me and Karol G, we let them racks talk
Don't run up on us, 'cause they lettin' the Makks off (Rrr!)

Pero si le ponen la canción (Hmm)
Le da una depresión tonta (Tonta)
Llorando lo comienza a llamar
Pero él la dejó en buzón (No)
¿Será porque con otra está (Con otra está)
¿Fingiendo que a otra se puede amar?
Eh, ah

Un-un shot pa' la pena profunda (Un shot, eh)
Y seguimo' gastando la funda (La funda)
Otro shot pa' la mente (Yeah, yeah)
Pa' que el recuerdo no la atormente (Ah; oh)
Ya no le copia a nada (Na')
Su ex ya no vale nada (Nada)
Se va pa' la disco y sólo quiere perrear (Perrear)
Pero se confunde cuando empieza a tomar (Tomar)

Ella se cura con rumba (Ah)
Y el amor pa' la tumba (Yeah)
To' los hombre' le zumban (Le zumban)

Pero si le ponen la canción (Oh)
Le da una depresión tonta (Tonta)
Llorando lo comienza a llamar
Pero él la dejó en buzón (Oh)
¿Será porque con otra está (Con otra está)
¿Fingiendo que a otra se puede amar?

Hey, Karol G (Ajá; Karol G)
Nicki Minaj (Ah, ajá), hey
""The Queen"" with ""The Queen"" (Ajá, jajaja)
O-O-Ovy on the Drums
Ay!

Love in a thousand different flavors
I wish that I could taste them all tonight
No, I ain't got no dinner plans
So you should bring all your friends
I swear that a-all y'all my type

Come on take a sip 'cause you know what I'm servin', ooh

Shimmy shimmy shimmy yay, shimmy yah
Bad girls gon' swalla-la-la
Bust down on my wrist in this bitch
My pinky-ring bigger than his
Met her out in Beverly Hills, ay
Dolla got too many girls, ay
Met her out in Beverly Hills
All she wear is red bottom heels
When she back it up, put it on the Snap
When she droppin' low, put it on the Gram
DJ poppin', she gon' swallow that
Champagne poppin', she gon' swallow that

All you girls in here, if you're feeling thirsty
Come on take a sip 'cause you know what I'm servin', ooh

Shimmy shimmy yay, shimmy yay, shimmy ya (Drank)

How y'all wifing these thots? You don't get wins for that
I'm having another good year, we don't get blimps for that
Pussy game still cold, we don't get minks for that
When I'm poppin' them bananas, we don't link chimps for that
I gave these bitches two years, now your time's up
Bless her heart, she throwing shots but every line sucks
I'm in that cherry red foreign with the brown guts
My shit slappin' like dude did LeBron's nuts

All you girls in here, if you're feeling thirsty
Come on take a sip 'cause you know what I'm servin'

LYRICS

You promised the world and I fell for it 
I put you first and you adored it
You set fires to my forest
And you let it burn 
Sang off key in my chorus 
Cause it wasn’t yours 
I saw the signs and I ignored it 
Rose colored glasses all distorted 
You set fire to my purpose
And I let it burn 
You got off on the hurtin’ 
When it wasn’t yours 
We’d always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me 
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me 

To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to lose you to love me 
To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to lose you to love me
I gave my all and they all know it
You tore me down and now it’s showing 
In two months you replaced us
Like it was easy
Made me think I deserved it
In the thick of healing 
We’d always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me 
This dancing was killing me softly 
I needed to hate you to love me 

To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to lose you to love me 
To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to lose you to love me 
You promised the world and I fell for it 
I put you first and you adored it
You set fires to my forest
And you let it burn 
Sang off key in my chorus- 

To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to hate you to love me
To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to lose you to love me
To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah

And now the chapter is closed and done 
And now it’s goodbye
It’s goodbye for us

LYRICS 

Wanna hear a part to my story
I tried to hide in the glory and sweep it under the table so you would never know
Sometimes I feel like an accident
People look when they're passing it
Never check on the passenger
They just want the free show

Yeah I'm constantly 
Tryna fight something that my eyes can't see

My Mind & Me
We don't get along sometimes and it
Gets hard to breathe
But I wouldn't change my life
And all of the crashing and burning and breaking I know now
If somebody sees me like this then they won't feel alone now
My Mind & Me

It's hard to talk and feel heard
When you always feel like a burden
Don't wanna add to concern I know they already got
But if I pull back the curtain 
Then maybe someone who's hurting will be a little more certain
They're not the only ones lost

Yeah I'm constantly 
Tryna fight something that my eyes can't see

My Mind & Me
We don't get along sometimes and it
Gets hard to breathe
But I wouldn't change my life
And all of the crashing and burning and breaking I know now
If somebody sees me like this then they won't feel alone now
My Mind & Me

Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh
My Mind & Me
Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh
My Mind & Me
Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh
My Mind & Me
Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh
Oh, it's only my mind & me
My Mind & Me

LYRICS

You were running through me like water
Now the feeling’s leaving me dry 
These days we couldn’t be farther 
So how’s it feel to be on the other side?

So many wasted nights with you 
I still can taste it, I hate it 
Wish I could take it back 'cause-

We used to be close
But people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 
And what hurts the most 
Is people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 

We used to be close
But people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 
And what hurts the most 
Is people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 

When it was good we were on fire
Now I’m breathing ashes and dust
I always wanna get higher-
I never know when enough is enough 

So many wasted nights with you 
I still can taste it, I hate it 
Wish I could take it back, 'cause-

We used to be close
But people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 
And what hurts the most 
Is people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 

We used to be close
But people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 
And what hurts the most 
Is people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 

From people you know to people you don’t
From people you know to people you don’t

We used to be close
But people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 
And what hurts the most 
Is people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 

We used to be close
But people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 
And what hurts the most 
Is people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 

From people you know to people you don’t
From people you know to people you don’t
From people you know to people you don’t
From people you know to people you don’t

ABOUT SELENA GOMEZ
Selling more than 176 million singles and over 34 billion global streams it’s safe to say Selena has achieved great success as a recording artist. “Lose You To Love Me,” the first single off her critically acclaimed album “Rare,” marked a historic moment for the singer as she landed her first No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The album debuted at the top of the charts; her third consecutive album to debut at No.1 on the Billboard Album chart. Most recently, Selena released her well received EP “Relevación”, her first all-Spanish language music project which was nominated for a Latin Grammy.  Gomez has produced a fearless slate of both television and film including the hit Netflix original series “13 Reasons Why.”  She went on to produce the lauded Netflix docu-series “Living Undocumented.  Gomez executive produces and appears on the buzzworthy hit HBO Max cooking series “Selena + Chef.”  Most recently, Selena executive produced and stars in the critically acclaimed Hulu series “Only Murders in the Building”. Last year, Gomez launched her beauty line Rare Beauty.  As part of the partnership, Gomez launched the Rare Impact Fund, pledging to raise $100 million for mental health services.

(Lyrics):
Double D
Big full breast on my baby (yo we goin' to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been goin' to work
Boss ain't workin' ya like this
He can't take care of you like this
Now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam
Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India
Lost on a train, lost
Got on my butter cream (there we go) silk shirt and it's Versace (Wanna buy them Prototypes)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl (too weird to live, too rare to die)
No I don't really wish
I don’t wish the titties was yours
No, have I ever
Have I ever let you get caught?
Lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam
Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India
Lost on a train, lost
She's at a stove (who?)
Can't believe I got her out here cookin' dope (cookin' dope)
I promise she'll be
Whippin' meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothin' wrong (Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)
No nothin' wrong with lie
Nothin' wrong with another short plane ride (nothin' wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I) are lost
Lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam
Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India
Lost on a train, lost
Love lost, lost
Love love,
Love lost, lost
Love love
Love lost
Love love
Love lost

Lyrics:

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (yeah)
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all of 'em""
Happiness is the same price as red bottoms
My smile is beamin', my skin is gleamin'
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (you've seen it)
I bought a crib just for the closet
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
Yeah, my receipts, be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, ""Put it in the bag, "" yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, give me the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)

Lyrics:
THE WEEKND
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I’m not with you
But then you saw me caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eyes
I don’t know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You could’ve asked my why I broke your heart
You could’ve told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn’t there
And just pretended like you didn’t care
I don’t know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Take me back cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another…
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day

ARIANA GRANDE
Met you once under a Pisces moon
I kept my distance ‘cause I know that you
Don’t like when I’m with nobody else
I couldn’t help it, I put you through hell
I don’t know why I run away, oh boy
I make you cry when I run away
Boy take me back ‘cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that it’s much too late
And you deserve someone better

THE WEEKND & ARIANA GRANDE
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
I don’t know why, I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day

Official “positions” Lyrics:

Heaven sent you to me
I’m just hoping I don’t repeat history

Boy I’m tryna meet your mama 
on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love 
on a Monday
Never need no 
No one else, babe
‘Cause I’ll be

Switching the positions for you
Cooking in the kitchen and I’m in the bedroom
I’m in the Olympics way I’m jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn’t do
That I won’t do, switching for 

Perfect, perfect
You’re too good to be true
But I get tired of running
Fuck it, now I’m running with you (with you)

Said boy I’m tryna meet your mama
on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love
on a Monday
Never need no 
No one else babe
‘Cause I’ll be

Switching the positions for you
Cooking in the kitchen and I’m in the bedroom
I’m in the Olympics way I’m jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn’t do
That I won’t do, switching for you
Cooking in the kitchen and I’m in the bedroom
I’m in the Olympics way I’m jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn’t do
That I won’t do, switching for you

This some shit that I 
Usually don’t do
But for you I kinda
Kinda want to
Cause youre down for me
And I’m down too
Yeah I’m down too
Switching the positions for you

This some shit that I 
Usually don’t do
But for you I kinda
Kinda want to
Cause youre down for me
And I’m down too

Switching the positions for you
Cooking in the kitchen and I’m in the bedroom
I’m in the Olympics way I’m jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn’t do
That I won’t do, switching for you
Cooking in the kitchen and I’m in the bedroom

Lyrics:

Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, ""Thank you"" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next (next)
Thank you, next (next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (next)
Thank you, next (next)
Thank you, next (next)
I'm so fuckin'
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (so good with that)
She taught me love (love)
She taught me patience (patience)
How she handles pain (pain)
That shit's amazing (yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say
Thank you, next (thank you, next)
Thank you, next (thank you, next)
Thank you, next (thank you)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (thank you, next)
Thank you, next (said thank you, next)
Thank you, next (next)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next
Thank you, next

I'm so fucking
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (song is a smash)
I've got so much love (love)
Got so much patience (patience)
I've learned from the pain (pain)
I turned out amazing (turned out amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (yeah, yeah)

Lyrics:

I’m not one to stick around
One strike and you’re out baby
Don’t care if I sound crazy
But u never let me down 
No, no
That’s why when the sun’s up I’m stayin
Still laying in your bed sayin

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on our hands
Might as well cancel our plans
I could stay here
For a 
Lifetime

So lock the door, and throw out the key
Can’t fight this no more, it’s just u and me
And there’s nothin I, nothin I 
I can do
I’m stuck with u
Stuck with u
Stuck with u
So go ahead and drive me insane
Baby run your mouth, I still wouldn’t change
Being stuck with u
Stuck with u
Stuck with u
I’m stuck with u 
Stuck with u
Stuck with u baby

There’s nowhere we need to be
No, no, no
Ima get to know u better
Kinda hope we’re here forever
There’s nobody on the streets
And if u told me the world’s endin
Ain’t no other way that I can spend it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time in my hands
Might as well cancel our plans
I could stay here
Forever

So lock the door, and throw out the key
Can’t fight this no more, it’s just u and me
And there’s nothin I, nothin I
I can do
I’m stuck with u
Stuck with u
Stuck with u
So go ahead, and drive me insane
Baby run your mouth, I still wouldn’t trade
Being stuck with u 
Stuck with u
Stuck with u
I’m stuck with u
Stuck with u
Stuck with u

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Baby come take all my time
Go on make me lose my mind
We got all that we need here tonight

Lock the door, and throw out the key
Can’t fight this no more, it’s just u and me
And there’s nothing I
Nothing I’d rather do
I’m stuck with u
Stuck with u
Stuck with u
So go ahead and drive me insane
Baby run your mouth, I still wouldn’t trade all this
Lovin u, hatin u, wantin u
I’m stuck with u
Stuck with u
Stuck with 
u
Stuck with u
Stuck with u

Official “34+35” Lyrics:

You might think I’m crazy
The way I been craving
If I put it quite plainly
Just gimme them babies

So what you doing tonight? 
Better say doing you right
Watching movies but we aint seen a thing tonight

I don’t wanna keep you up
But show me can you keep it up 
‘Cause then I’ll have to keep you up
Shit maybe I’mma keep you up, boy

I been drinking coffee 
And I been eating healthy 
You know I keep it squeaky 
Saving up my energy 

Can you stay up all night
Fuck me til the daylight 
34 35
Can you stay up all night
Fuck me til the daylight 
34 35

You drink it just like water 
You say it taste like candy
So what you doing tonight? 
Better say doing you right
Watching movies but we aint seen a thing tonight

I don’t wanna keep you up
But show me can you keep it up 
‘Cause then I’ll have to keep you up
Shit maybe I’mma keep you up, boy

I been drinking coffee
And I been eating healthy
You know I keep it squeaky
Saving up my energy

Can you stay up all night
Fuck me til the daylight 
34 35
Can you stay up all night
Fuck me til the daylight 
34 35

Baby you might need a seatbelt when I ride it
I’mma leave it open like a door, come inside it
Even though I’m wifey you can hit it like a side chick
Don’t need no side dick, no

Got the neighbors yelling earthquake
4.5 when I make the bed shake
Put it down heavy even though it’s lightweight

Yeah we started at midnight
Go til the sunrise
Done at the same time
But who’s counting the time when we got it for life

I know all your favorite spots
We can take it from the top
You such a dream come true true
Make a bitch wanna hit snooze ooh

Can you stay up all night
Fuck me til the daylight 
34 35
Can you stay up all night
Fuck me til the daylight 
34 35

Means I wanna 69 witcha
Aww shit

“boyfriend” Lyrics: 

I’m a mother fuckin train wreck 
I don’t wanna be too much 
but I don’t wanna miss your touch 
and you don’t seem to give a fuck 
I don’t wanna keep you waiting 
but I do just what I have to do 
and I might not be the one for u 
but you ain’t about to have no boo

Cause I know we be so complicated
but we be so smitten it’s crazy 
I can’t have what I want but neither can you

you ain’t my boyfriend 
and I ain’t your girlfriend 
but u don’t want me to see nobody else 
and I don’t want you to see nobody 
but you ain’t my boyfriend 
and I ain’t your girlfriend 
but you don’t want me to touch nobody else 
baby we ain’t gotta tell nobody 

Even though you ain’t mine I promise the way we way we fight 
Make me honestly feel like we just in love 
Cuz baby when push comes to shove. 
Damn baby I’m train wreck too
I lose my mind when it comes to you
I take time with the ones I choose 
And I don’t want to smile if it ain’t from you yeah

I know we be so complicated
Lovin’ you sometimes drive me crazy
Cause I can’t have what I want and neither can you

you ain’t my boyfriend 
(boyfriend)
and I ain’t your girlfriend 
(girlfriend)
but you don’t want me to see nobody else 
and I don’t want you to see nobody 
but you ain’t my boyfriend 
(boyfriend)
and I ain’t your girlfriend 
(girlfriend)
but you don’t want me to touch nobody else 
baby we ain’t gotta tell nobody 

I want to kiss you (yeah), don’t wanna miss you (yeah) 
But I can’t be with you cause I got issues,
Yeah on the surface, it seems like it’s easy,
Careful with words but still hard to read me,
Stress high when the trust low,
Bad vibes when the fun go,
Try to open up and love more,
Try to open up and love more,

If you were my boyfriend
And you were my girlfriend,
I probably wouldn’t see nobody else
but I can’t guarantee that by myself,

you ain’t my boyfriend 
(boyfriend)
and I ain’t your girlfriend 
(girlfriend)
but you don’t want me to see nobody else 
and I don’t want you to see nobody 
but you ain’t my boyfriend
(boyfriend) 
and I ain’t your girlfriend 
(girlfriend)
but you don’t want me to touch nobody else 
baby we ain’t gotta tell nobody 

but you ain’t my boyfriend 
(boyfriend)
and I ain’t your girlfriend 
(girlfriend)
but you don’t want me to see nobody else 
and I don’t want you to see nobody 
but you ain’t my boyfriend 
(boyfriend)
and I ain’t your girlfriend 
(girlfriend)
but you don’t want me to touch nobody else 
baby we ain’t gotta tell nobody

Lyrics:

You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you
My one, when all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight
My one, it lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman
I don't wanna waste no time, yeah
You ain't got a one-track mind, yeah
Have it any way you like, yeah
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it
Ain't nobody else can relate
Boy, I like that you ain't afraid
Baby, lay me down and let's pray
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it
And I can be all the things you told me not to be
(Yeah)
When you try to come for me, I keep on flourishing
(Yeah)
And he see the universe when I'm the company
It's all in me
You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you
My one, when all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight
My one, it lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman
I'll tell you all the things you should know
So, baby, take my hand, save your soul
We can make it last, take it slow, hmm
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it, yeah
But you're different from the rest
And boy, if you confess, you might get blessed
See if you deserve what comes next
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it
And I can be all the things you told me not to be
(Yeah)
When you try to come for me, I keep on flourishing
(Yeah)
And he see the universe when I'm the company
It's all in me
You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you
My one, when all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight
My one, it lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
(God is a woman, yeah)
My one
(One)
When all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
You'll believe God
(God is a woman)
Oh, yeah
(God is a woman, yeah)
(One)
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman

Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
""Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen""

[Chorus 1]
All this running around
Trying to cover my shadow
A notion growing inside
Now all the others seem shallow
All this running around
Bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm
It must be morning

[Verse 2]
I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen
It's gonna feel so good
It's gonna feel so good

[Verse 1]
It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
""Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen""
It's gonna feel so good

[Chorus 2]
All this running around
I can't fight it much longer
Something's trying to get out
And it's never been closer
If my take-off fails
Make up some other story
But if I never come back
Tell my mother I'm sorry

[Bridge]
(Gibberish)

[Outro]
Baby, now I'm ready, moving on
Oh but maybe I was ready all along
Oh I'm ready for the moment and the sound
Oh but maybe I was ready all along
Baby, now I'm ready, moving on
Oh but maybe I was ready all along
Oh I'm ready for the moment and the sound
Oh but maybe I was ready all along

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is a prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Hey, brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey, sister
Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Verse 2]
Hey, brother
Do you still believe in one another?
Hey, sister
Do you still believe in love?
I wonder

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Chorus]
What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you out
Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Hey, brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey, sister
Do you still believe in love?
I wonder

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Chorus]
What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you out
Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

The record was almost entirely Cudi-written and Cudi-produced, with a single feature from R&B and neo-soul legend Raphael Saadiq.

Today the Kid's back with ""Love,"" a smooth, Ratatat-sampling cut from the Satellite Flight era. The word from Mr. Mescudi, via his Soundcloud:

""Something I made during the SF sessions. produced by me, keys by Dot. Sample is from one of my favorite Ratatat jams 'Sunblocks.' And love to Evan and Mike for allowing me to release it. For you. Hope it brings you some peace if you have a lonely heart out there. byeeeee.""

Hope For The Day (HFTD) is a non-profit movement empowering the conversation on proactive suicide prevention and mental health education. Join the Proactive Suicide Prevention conversation at http://www.hftd.org 

Suicide Prevention starts with a conversation we're not having with our mental health due to Stigma. The first step to breaking that silence is dispelling stigmas of fear, judgement, and shame about our internal experiences. We achieve that by proclaiming It's Ok Not To Be Ok!

Lyrics:
Feeling like a drop in the ocean that don’t nobody notice
Maybe it’s all just in your head
Feeling like you’re trapped in your own skin, and now your body’s frozen
Broken down, you’ve got nothing left
When you’re high on emotion and you’re losing your focus and you feel too exhausted to pray
Don’t get lost in the moment or give up when you’re closest, all you need is somebody to say
It’s okay not to be okay
It’s okay not to be okay
When you’re down and you feel ashamed
It’s okay not to be okay
Feeling like your life’s an illusion and lately you’re secluded
Thinking you’ll never get your chance
Feeling like you got no solution, it’s only ‘cause you’re human
No control its out of your hands 
When you’re high on emotion and you’re losing your focus and you feel too exhausted to pray
Don’t get lost in the moment or give up when you’re closest, all you need is somebody to say
It’s okay not to be okay
It’s okay not to be okay
When you’re down and you feel ashamed
It’s okay not to be okay
When you’re high on emotion and you’re losing your focus and you feel too exhausted to pray
Don’t get lost in the moment or give up when you’re closest, all you need is somebody to say
It’s okay not to be okay
It’s okay not to be okay
When you’re down and you feel ashamed
It’s okay not to be okay
It’s okay not to be okay

Lyrics:
Tell me what you want, what you like, it's okay
I'm a little curious too
Tell me if it's wrong, if it's right, I don't care
I can keep a secret, can you?
Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite
Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer
Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared, 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
'Cause you and I, we're cool for the summer
Tell me if I won, if I did, what's my prize?
I just wanna play with you too
Even if they judge, fuck it, I'll do the time
I just wanna have some fun with you
Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite
Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer
Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared, 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
'Cause you and I, we're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer
Shh, don't tell your mother
Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite
(Take me down)
Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared, 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try (Wanna try)
'Cause you and I (You and I)
We're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer

Doing what we do, it’s entirely all about the fans.  We walk a fine line by being “famous” and in the public eye but we are only here because of you, the fans.  Justin wrote this record during a tough time in his life and it comes to us that sometimes, as artists, we are also just objects and we have to take that as much as we have to use that to create.  We all do this for you, respect that you put us here and it’s Ü that made the video.” - JACK Ü

LYRICS

Party in da getto
Inna da getto
Party in da getto
Inna da getto
Esto se jodio 
La vecina no se que bebió 
El vecino no se que prendió 
A la gente no se que le dio 
Pero to’ el mundo esta loco 
to’ el mundo to’ el mundo esta loco 
to’ el mundo rayado del coco 
yo solo se que montaron 

Party in da getto
Inna da getto
Party in da getto
Inna da getto
Party in da getto
Inna da getto
Party in da getto
Inna de getto
En el getto el party 
Todo el mundo everybody 
Estamos Flow rastafari 
Esta perfecto ese body 
Mami tu estas bien salvaje 
Y yo que estoy de safari 
DJ no le baje pongan la de tego y de daddy
Ese culo es de quilate se te nota los pilates
Hoy tu ganas o yo gano no lo dejemos en empate 
En mi casa se remate 
Nos fuimos low key 
Callao sin dar detalles
La gente ya se dio cuenta que montamos la disco en la calle
Y esto es

Party in da getto
Inna da getto
Party in da getto
Inna da getto

Party in da getto
Inna da getto
Party in da getto
Inna da getto

En el barrio 
Siempre hay bailoteo 
Ave maria 
El trago nunca falta ni la buena compañía 
 Yeah 
Como ha cambiado la vida 
Yo crecí en el ghetto y el mundo es la casa mía 

Party in da getto
Inna da getto
Party in da getto
Inna da getto
Party in da getto
Inna da getto
Party in da getto
Inna da getto

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Bitch, be humble (hol’ up, bitch)
(hol’ up, bitch)
(hol’ up, bitch)
(hol’ up, hol’ up, hol’ up)

Sit down (hol’ up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol’ up)
Be humble 
Sit down (hol’ up)
Be humble 
Sit down (hol’ up, hol’ up, hol' up)

Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

Bitch, be humble (hol’ up, bitch)
(hol’ up, bitch)
(hol’ up)
(hol’ up, hol’ up, hol’ up)

Sit down (hol’ up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol’ up)
Be humble 
Sit down (hol’ up, hol' up)
Be humble 
Sit down (hol’ up, hol’up, hol’ up, hol' up)
