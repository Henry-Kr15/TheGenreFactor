Lyrics: 
in my head right now
voices to loud
I can‚Äôt shut them up
Try to fake the fun
I can‚Äôt slow down
Think I had enough

Guess that it means that I‚Äôm calling it off
I wanna go though I stayed here for us
Messing up things and then calling it love

I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôll miss you so I take the chance
Need one more touch and then never again
Then I could say that we loved till the end

Were gonna dance dance dance through the night
With your ha ha hand right in mine
I‚Äôm gonna le le leave you behind
So lets dance dance dance one last time

And we can move, you and I
until we lose our minds
I‚Äôm gonna le le leave you behind
So lets dance dance dance one last time

I can‚Äôt eat, I can‚Äôt breath
lost a part of me
but this is what we need

But you know I've learned
Sometimes good things hurt
I can‚Äôt stay to please

[Lyrics]
Ooh, Ooh

I think you should know you saved my life

I don‚Äôt think you realize
What you‚Äôve done for me 
Oh
I don‚Äôt think you realize 
What a little love could mean 

Oh you, you stay by my side 
And you, you kept on the lights
And you knew just what to say 
When I was fading 

Sometimes all that you need is
Someone who can believe in you 
More than you do 

I was lost until I saw your halo 
I was blind until I saw your light
I believe my friend 
We all have angels 
And you are mine 
I think you should know you saved my life 

Ooh, ooh 
I think you should know you saved my life

Ooh, ooh 
I think you should know you saved my life

I don‚Äôt think you realize
What your words can do 
Oh, the whole world was falling all around me 
But I held on 
To you 

Oh you, you stay by my side 
And you, you kept on the lights
And you knew just what to say 
When I was fading 

Sometimes all that you need is
Someone who can believe in you 
More than you do 

I was lost until I saw your halo 
I was blind until I saw your light
I believe my friend
We all have angels 
And you are mine 
I think you should know you saved my life 

Ooh, ooh 

I think you should know you saved my life
I was lost until I saw your halo 

Ooh, ooh

I was blind until I saw your light
I think you should know you saved my life
I believe my friend we all have angels 

Ooh, ooh

And you are mine 
(and you are mine) 

I think you should know you saved my life

Lyrics:
Me ca√≠, me par√©, camin√©, me sub√≠
Me fui contra la corriente y tambi√©n me perd√≠
Fracas√©, me encontr√©, lo viv√≠ y aprend√≠
Cuando te pegas fuerte m√°s profundo es el beat
Sigo bailando y escribiendo mis letras
Sigo cantando con las puertas abiertas
Atravesando todas estas tierras
Y no hay que viajar tanto pa' encontrar la respuesta
Y no te preocupes si no te aprueban
Cuando te critiquen, t√∫ solo di
Soy yo
Soy yo
Soy yo (soy, soy, soy, soy, soy, soy, soy)
Soy yo (yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo)
Sigo caminando y sigo riendo
Hago lo que quiero y muero en el intento
A nadie le importa lo que estoy haciendo
Lo √∫nico que importa es lo que est√° por dentro
A m√≠ me gusta estar en la arena
Ba√±arme en el mar sin raz√≥n, sin problema
Estar sentada sin hacer nada
Mirando de lejos y estar relajada
Y no te preocupes si no te aprueban
Cuando te critiquen, t√∫ solo di
Soy yo
Soy yo
Soy yo (soy, soy, soy, soy, soy, soy, soy)
Soy yo (yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo)
Soy as√≠, soy as√≠, soy as√≠ (Relaja)
Y t√∫ ni me conoces a m√≠ (Bien relaja)
Soy as√≠, soy as√≠, soy as√≠ (Relaja)
Y t√∫ ni me conoces a m√≠ (Bien relaja)
You know what I mean? You know what I mean?
S√≠, pap√°
Y no te preocupes si no te aprueban

Soy yo
Soy yo (soy, soy, soy, soy, soy, soy, soy)
Soy yo (yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo)
En la cama
Relaj√°
Con mi encanto
Con pijama, soy yo

If I hit it two times, then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls

It ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe
In your face, what'd you say? (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

üí¨ Love Runs Out Lyrics: 
What if our love runs out
Don‚Äôt wanna let you down
You know, ah
What if our love runs out

Yeah, can‚Äôt help but think what if
Fast forward five or six
Years and some change we end up Mr. and Mrs. Smith
My baby with the shits
Right now it‚Äôs perfect bliss
But what if one day I wake up and I don‚Äôt feel like this
If I can‚Äôt trust you feel disconnected in ‚Äòfront you
I just realized, been a couple days since I f*cked you
Somethings feeling strange I don‚Äôt feel the same when I touch you
And I could feel the distance I wonder if I still love you
For real, yeah

Cause babe I‚Äôve learned my lesson
Sorry for second guessing
But I‚Äôve just got a question

What if our love runs out
What if our love runs out
What if one day we wake up and don‚Äôt feel like we do now
What if our love runs out
What if our love runs out
What if one day we wake up and we both want something else
What if our love runs out

What if our love runs out

What if our love runs out
I don‚Äôt wanna let you down

What if our love runs out

Can‚Äôt help but think what if
This love‚Äôs the perfect gift
Cause when I‚Äôm down at my lowest you come give me a lift
Let‚Äôs fix our direction before we go adrift
Cause if it‚Äôs worth it let‚Äôs work it I‚Äôm down to run a risk
It‚Äôs feeling perfect for certain right now but then again
If I lost you I never could be your friend again
Doubts creep up inside us if we both let em in
Unless we both never let in that question enterin‚Äô

Cause babe I‚Äôve learned my lesson
Sorry for second guessing
But I‚Äôve just got a question

What if our love runs out
What if our love runs out
What if one day we wake up and don‚Äôt feel like we do now
What if our love runs out
What if our love runs out
What if one day we wake up and we both want something else
What if our love runs out

What if our love runs out

What if our love runs out
I don‚Äôt wanna let you down

What if our love runs out

Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowin' up our phones, phones
Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties
Tryna get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh

Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seeing it in my dreams
I'm looking down every alley
I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping hitting my head against the wall

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Whenever you tell me I'm pretty
That's when the hunger really hits me
You're little heart goes pitter-patter
I want your liver on a platter
Use your finger to stir my tea
And for dessert I'll suck your teeth
Be too sweet and you'll be a goner
Yeah, I'll pull a Jeffrey Dahmer
I eat boys up, breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty, I drink their blood
Carnivore, animal, I am a Cannibal
I eat boys up, you better run
I am cannibal (cannibal, cannibal, I am)

Wanna see you walking out that door
Bye bye bye bye 
You won‚Äôt see me begging for a second chance
Say I need you cos it don‚Äôt make sense

Movin‚Äô ‚Äòtil my feet get sore
Hands all on me ‚Äòtil my dress gets torn
Watch me do it do it real hardcore, my my my
You and me we never ever made much sense
I‚Äôm too independent no offense boy
Don‚Äôt be sad about the things I said
Don‚Äôt cry cry cry
 
Tonight I‚Äôm gon be rockin it
Droppin it
Shake my ass no stoppin it
I look hot in it
Hot in it

Used To Know Me lyrics
[Intro]
You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
You, you, you, you

[Verse 1]
You had me 'round your finger, you had me on the floor
I used to be your angel, now I'm walking out your door
You say I'm turning evil, I'll say I'm finally pure
Shine bright in my reflection, think I lost myself before

[Pre-Chorus]
Held me back, tied me up inside a cage
Had to change my life 'cause I knew you'd stay the same
Couldn't see you were standing in my way
I can see clearly now, now, now

[Chorus]
You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
I'm finally free from your control
I don't need a kiss goodbye, I'm on my own tonight, oh
You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
I'm finally free from your control
I don't need a kiss goodbye, I'm on my own tonight, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm like a flower blooming since I left you behind
Don't know what I was doing, thought your venom was divine
Knew you were turning evil, you said I lost my mind
No, you ain't gonna do me like that-at-at-at

[Pre-Chorus]
Held me back, tied me up inside a cage
Had to change my life 'cause I knew you'd stay the same
Couldn't see you were standing in my way
I can see clearly now, now, now

[Chorus]
You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy (So)
I'm finally free from your control (Control)
I don't need a kiss goodbye, I'm on my own tonight, oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah

[Outro]
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la-la-la (La-la)
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
You used to know me, now you don't

""India is special and its beauty absolutely humbled me. When we toured there as Major Lazer, it was mind blowing to see our fan-base and we wanted to incorporate the attitude and positive vibes into our video and just do something that embodies the essence of Major Lazer. Major Lazer has always been a culture mashup and to us, India feels like some kind of special creature with one foot in history and one firmly in the future. The experience is something we'll never forget.""

Que calor, que ca

Que calor, yeca

Por favor, que ca
En la discoteca
Que calor, yeca
Para la mu√±eca por favor

Esa rubia no me entiende si yo le hablo espa√±ol
Pero se aprendi√≥ la canci√≥n a la perfecci√≥n (lo sabe)
Por mi patria, por my nation
Ninguna discriminacion
Aqui no hay raza ni religion
Bailalo por obligaci√≥n

Que calor (x2)
Que Calor, yeca
En la discoteca
Que calor, yeca
Para la mu√±eca
Por favor (x2)

La mujeres me la como al vapor
En la playa ba√±ado en sudor 
Los bikinis te queden mejor
Tu eres mi amor (mor mor mor)
Cada vez que veo ese booty yo me quedo loco
Tu le das asta abajo mami con mucho saoco
Como tu lo mueves en el mundo lo mueven poco
Dale dale, baila a lo loco
Como tu lo mueves en el mundo lo mueven poco 
Dale dale, baila a lo loco
Como tu lo mueves en el mundo lo mueven poco

Calentamiento global
Anda suelto el animal
Mano arriba el que es real
Esto se va ser viral

Que calor, que ca
En la discoteca
Que calor, yeca
Para la mu√±eca

Por favor, que ca

From the album Peace Is The Mission

[LYRICS]
Oh my my my what you do to me 
Like lightning when I'm swimming in the sea 
From the very first time we loved 
From the very first time we touched

Walking on wires and power lines 
When you put your body on top of mine 
Every time that you lift me up 
To the heaven and stars above

O lord of mercy im beggin you please 
I'm feelin drained I need love 
You torch me up like electricity 
Jumpstart my heart with your love

There's an energy 
When you hold me 
When you touch me 
It's so powerful I can feel it 
When you hold me 
When you touch me 
It's so powerful

There's an energy 
When you hold me 
When you touch me 
It's so powerful 
I can feel it 
When you hold me 
When you touch me 
It's so powerful

I couldn't leave if I wanted to 
Cause something keeps pulling me back to you 
From the very first time we loved 
From the very first time we touched

The stroke of your fingers 
The scent of you lingers 
My mind running wild With thoughts of your smile 
Oh you gotta give me some 
You could give it all but it's never enough, no

O lord of mercy im beggin you please 
I'm feelin drained I need love 
You torch me up like electricity 
Jumpstart my heart with your love

There's an energy 
When you hold me 
When you touch me 
It's so powerful I can feel it 
Oh I need it Oh this energy 
It's so powerful

I can feel it 
When you hold me 
When you touch me
Its so powerful

There's an energy
When you hold me 
When you touch me 
It's so powerful 
When you hold me 
When you touch me 
Its so powerful

When you hold me in your arms 
Burns like fire and electricity 
When you're close 
I feel the sparks 
Takes me higher, to infinity

Lyrics:
Now baby
Can‚Äôt tell you why we
Ain‚Äôt getting high no more
Tried so hard
There‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been feeling
And we‚Äôre lonely
But we never used to be
Either we‚Äôre arguing or you leave
We both know something‚Äôs missing

I‚Äôve been holding on
Holding on to nothing
You don‚Äôt care too much
And it‚Äôs obvious
That you‚Äôre already gone
So unleash your weapon
Aim it at my chest then

If our love is a drug
You‚Äôre the one with the trigger
Shoot me down, shoot me down
I don‚Äôt wanna remember you
Don‚Äôt try to change your mind
When the blood is on your hands
Shoot me down, shoot me down
I don‚Äôt wanna remember you

Soul to soul
We used to rock so slow
I felt your blood boil
And my heartbeat rush
You free me, why‚Äôs it slipping?
There‚Äôs no one left
Go on and hold your breath
Say that you want me
But you don‚Äôt want stress
I can‚Äôt say that I feel different

If I ride with you, better know that I'mma ride for you

But I be fallin' back from all the loose change
I drop the top on that new thing

Gotta know it's impossible to stop Folarin
Got the box, I want the new thing, yeah

Before its wahala, ""Roll out, roll out,"" mmm, yeah
She gon' show out, show out

Florence + The Machine - You've Got The Love (Lyrics)

Sometimes, I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes, I feel like saying, ""Lord, I just don't care""
But you've got the love I need to see me through

Sometimes, it seems the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then, it seems that life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through
When food is gone, you are my daily need, oh
When friends are gone, I know my savior's love is real
You know it's real

'Cause you've got the love, you've got the love and you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love and you've got the love

Time after time I think, ""Oh, Lord, what's the use?""
Time after time, I think it's just no good
'Cause sooner or later in life, the things you love, you lose
But you've got the love I need to see me through

You've got the love, you've got the love and you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love and you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love and you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love and you've got the love

Sometimes, I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
'Cause I know I can count on you, oh
Sometimes, I feel like saying, ""Lord, I just don't care""
But you've got the love I need to see me through",True,True,431212839.0,Not Found

Florence + The Machine - Shake It Out (Lyrics)

Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight, I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh-woah

And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight, I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh-woah (Shake him off)

And it's hard to dance
With a devil on your back (Shake him off)
And given half the chance
Would I take any of it back? (Shake him off)
It's a fine romance
But it's left me so undone (Shake him off)
It's always darkest before the dawn (Shake him off)
(Oh-woah)
(Oh-woah)

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
'Cause looking for Heaven, found the devil in me (Oh-woah)
Looking for Heaven, found the devil in me (Oh-woah)
But, what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen to me, yeah

Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh-woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh-woah",True,True,338501370.0,baroque pop

Florence + The Machine - Never Let Me Go (Lyrics)

Looking up from underneath
Fractured moonlight on the sea
Reflections still look the same to me
As before I went under
And it's peaceful in the deep
Cathedral where you cannot breathe
No need to pray, no need to speak
Now I am under all

And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the sea bed
Found the place to rest my head
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go

And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean delivered me

Though the pressure's hard to take
It's the only way I can escape
It seems a heavy choice to make
And now I am under, oh

And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the seabed
Found the place to rest my head
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go

And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean delivered me

And it's over and I'm going under
But I'm not giving up, I'm just giving in
I'm slipping underneath
So, so cold and so sweet
And the arms of the ocean, so sweet and so cold
And all this devotion I never knew at all
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner released
And the arms of the ocean delivered me

Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
Delivered me
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go (Delivered me)
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go (Delivered me)
Never let me go, never let me go
And it's over and I'm going under
But I'm not giving up, I'm just giving in
I'm slipping underneath
So cold and so sweet

'My Love' lyrics
I always able to write my way out   
The song always made sense to me    
Now I find that when I look down   
Every page is empty   
There is nothing to describe    
Except the moon still bright against the worrying sky   
I pray the trees will get their leaves soon    
So tell me where to put my love   
Do I wait for time to do what it does   
I don‚Äôt know where to put my love   
And when it came,  
it was stranger than I had ever imagined    
No cracking open of heaven   
But quiet and still   
All my friends are getting ill 
So tell me where to put my love   
Do I wait for time to do what it does   
I don‚Äôt know where to put my love   
So tell me where to put my love   
Do I wait for time to do what it does   
I don‚Äôt know where to put my love   
My arms emptied, the skies emptied  
The billboards emptied    
My arms emptied, the skies emptied   
The buildings emptied   
So tell me where to put my love   
Do I wait for time to do what it does   
I don‚Äôt know where to put my love   
My arms emptied, the skies emptied  
The billboards emptied   
My arms emptied the skies emptied  
The buildings emptied",True,True,24499754.0,Not Found

Florence + The Machine - Cosmic Love (Lyrics)

A falling star fell from your heart and landed in my eyes
I screamed aloud, as it tore through them
And now it's left me blind

The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart

And in the dark, I can hear your heartbeat
I tried to find the sound
But then it stopped, and I was in the darkness
So darkness I became

The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart

I took the stars from our eyes, and then I made a map
And knew that somehow I could find my way back
Then I heard your heart beating, you were in the darkness too
So I stayed in the darkness with you

The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart

The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart",True,True,145384725.0,Not Found

LYRICS (FR)

[Intro]
Alors on-
Alors on-
Alors on-

[Couplet 1]
Qui dit √©tudes dit travail
Qui dit taff te dit des thunes
Qui dit argent dit d√©penses
Qui dit cr√©dit dit cr√©ance
Qui dit dette, te dit huissier
Lui dit assis dans la merde
Qui dit amour, dit les gosses
Dit toujours et dit divorce
Qui dit proches, te dit deuils
Car les probl√®mes ne viennent pas seul
Qui dit crise, te dit monde
Dit famine et dit tiers monde
Qui dit fatigue dit r√©veil
Encore sourd de la veille
Alors on sort pour oublier tous les probl√®mes

[Refrain]
Alors on danse
Alors on danse
Alors on danse
Alors on danse
Alors on danse
Alors on danse
Alors on danse
Alors on danse
Alors on danse

[Couplet 2]
Et l√† tu t‚Äôdis que c‚Äôest fini
Car pire que √ßa, ce s'rait la mort
Quand tu crois enfin qu'tu t‚Äôen sors
Quand y en a plus, et ben y en a encore
Est-ce la zik ou les probl√®mes ?
Les probl√®mes ou bien la musique ?
√áa t‚Äôprend les tripes, √ßa te prend la t√™te
Et puis tu pries pour qu'√ßa s‚Äôarr√™te
Mais c‚Äôest ton corps, c‚Äôest pas le ciel
Alors tu t‚Äôbouches plus les oreilles
Et l√† tu cries encore plus fort, et √ßa persiste

[Pont]
Alors on chante
Lalalalalala
Lalalalalala
Alors on chante
Lalalalalala
Lalalalalala
Alors on chante
Alors on chante
Et puis seulement quand c‚Äôest fini

[Refrain]
Alors on danse
Alors on danse
Alors on danse
Alors on danse
Alors on danse
Alors on danse
Alors on danse
Alors on danse",True,True,488128349.0,house music

LYRICS (FR)
[Couplet 1]
Dites-moi d'o√π il vient
Enfin je saurai o√π je vais
Maman dit que lorsqu'on cherche bien
On finit toujours par trouver
Elle dit qu'il n'est jamais tr√®s loin
Qu'il part tr√®s souvent travailler
Maman dit ""travailler c'est bien""
Bien mieux qu'√™tre mal accompagn√©
Pas vrai ?

[Pont]
O√π est ton papa ?
Dis-moi o√π est ton papa ?
Sans m√™me devoir lui parler
Il sait ce qui ne va pas
Ah sacr√© papa
Dis-moi o√π es-tu cach√© ?
√áa doit, faire au moins mille fois que j'ai
Compt√© mes doigts
Hey !

[Refrain]
O√π t'es, papaoutai ?

O√π t'es
O√π t'es...

[Couplet 2]
Quoi, qu'on y croit ou pas
Y aura bien un jour o√π on n'y croira plus
Un jour ou l'autre on sera tous papa
Et d'un jour √† l'autre on aura disparu
Serons-nous d√©testables ?
Serons-nous admirables ?
Des g√©niteurs ou des g√©nies ?
Dites-nous qui donne naissance aux irresponsables ?
Ah dites-nous qui, tiens
Tout le monde sait comment on fait des b√©b√©s
Mais personne sait comment on fait des papas
Monsieur Je-sais-tout en aurait h√©rit√©, c'est √ßa
Faut l'sucer d'son pouce ou quoi ?
Dites-nous o√π c'est cach√©, √ßa doit
Faire au moins mille fois qu'on a
Bouff√© nos doigts
Hey !

LYRICS (FR)
[Couplet 1]
Vous les hommes vous √™tes tous les m√™mes
Macho mais cheap
Bande de mauviettes infid√®les
Si pr√©visibles, non je ne suis pas certaine, que tu l'm√©rites
Z'avez d'la chance qu'on vous aime
Dis-moi ""Merci""

[Refrain]
Rendez-vous, rendez-vous, rendez-vous au prochain r√®glement
Rendez-vous, rendez-vous, rendez-vous s√ªrement aux prochaines r√®gles

[Couplet 2]
Cette fois c'√©tait la derni√®re
Tu peux croire que c'est qu'une crise
Mate une derni√®re fois mon derri√®re, il est √† c√¥t√© de mes valises
Tu diras au revoir √† ta m√®re, elle qui t'id√©alise
Tu n'vois m√™me pas tout c'que tu perds
Avec une autre ce serait pire
Quoi toi aussi tu veux finir maintenant ?
C‚Äôest l'monde √† l'envers!
Moi je l'disais pour t'faire r√©agir seulement... toi t'y pensais

[Refrain]
Rendez-vous, rendez-vous, rendez-vous au prochain r√®glement
Rendez-vous, rendez-vous, rendez-vous s√ªrement aux prochaines r√®gles

[Couplet 3]
Facile √† dire, je suis gnan-gnan
Et que j'aime trop les bla bla bla
Mais non non non, c'est important
Ce que t'appelles les ragnagnas
Tu sais la vie c'est des enfants
Mais comme toujours c'est pas l'bon moment
Ah oui pour les faire l√† tu es pr√©sent
Mais pour les √©lever y'aura des absents

[Pont]
Lorsque je n'serai plus belle
Ou du moins au naturel
Arr√™te je sais que tu mens
Il n'y a que Kate Moss qui est √©ternelle
Moche ou b√™te, c'est jamais bon !
B√™te ou belle, c'est jamais bon !
Belle ou moi, c'est jamais bon !
Moi ou elle, c'est jamais bon !

[Refrain]
Rendez-vous, rendez-vous, rendez-vous au prochain r√®glement
Rendez-vous, rendez-vous, rendez-vous s√ªrement aux prochaines r√®gles

[Outro]
Tous les m√™mes, tous les m√™mes, tous les m√™mes et y'en a marre
Tous les m√™mes, tous les m√™mes, tous les m√™mes et y'en a marre
Tous les m√™mes, tous les m√™mes, tous les m√™mes et y'en a marre

J'vais pas vous draguer, promis jur√©
J'suis c√©libataire, depuis hier putain !
J'peux pas faire d'enfant et bon c'est pas - Eh reviens !

Sant√© Lyrics

[Intro]
√Ä ceux qui n'en ont pas
√Ä ceux qui n'en ont pas

[Couplet 1]
Rosa, Rosa, quand on fout l'bordel, tu nettoies
Et toi, Albert, quand on trinque, tu ramasses les verres
C√©line (C√©line), 'bataire ('bataire), toi, tu t'prends des vestes au vestiaire
Arlette, arr√™te, toi, la f√™te, tu la passes aux toilettes

[Refrain]
Et si on c√©l√©brait ceux qui n'c√©l√®brent pas
Pour une fois, j'aimerais lever mon verre √† ceux qui n'en ont pas
√Ä ceux qui n'en ont pas

[Couplet 2]
Quoi les bonnes mani√®res ? Pourquoi j'ferais semblant ?
D'toute fa√ßon, elle est pay√©e pour le faire, tu t'prends pour ma m√®re ?
Dans une heure, j'reviens, qu'ce soit propre, qu'on puisse y manger par terre, trois heures que j'attends
Franchement, ils les fabriquent ou quoi ? Heureusement qu'c'est que deux verres
Appelle-moi ton responsable et fais vite, elle pourrait se finir comme √ßa, ta carri√®re

[Refrain]
Oui, c√©l√©brons ceux qui n'c√©l√®brent pas
Encore une fois, j'aimerais lever mon verre √† ceux qui n'en ont pas
√Ä ceux qui n'en ont pas
√Ä ceux qui n'en ont pas

[Pont]
Frotter, frotter, mieux vaut ne pas s'y frotter, frotter si tu n'me connais pas
Brosser, brosser, tu pourras toujours te brosser, brosser si tu n'me respectes pas

[Refrain]
Oui, c√©l√©brons ceux qui n'c√©l√®brent pas
Encore une fois, j'aimerais lever mon verre √† ceux qui n'en ont pas
√Ä ceux qui n'en ont pas

[Outro]
Pilote d'avion ou infirmi√®re, chauffeur de camion ou h√¥tesse de l'air
Boulanger ou marin-p√™cheur, un verre aux champions des pires horaires
Aux jeunes parents berc√©s par les pleurs, aux insomniaques de profession
Et tous ceux qui souffrent de peine de c≈ìur, qui n'ont pas l'c≈ìur aux c√©l√©brations
Qui n'ont pas l'c≈ìur aux c√©l√©brations

LYRICS (FR)

J'suis pas tout seul √† √™tre tout seul
√áa fait d'j√† √ßa d'moins dans la t√™te
Et si j'comptais, combien on est
Beaucoup
Tout ce √† quoi j'ai d'j√† pens√©
Dire que plein d'autres y ont d'j√† pens√©
Mais malgr√© tout je m'sens tout seul
Du coup
J'ai parfois eu des pens√©es suicidaires
Et j'en suis peu fier
On croit parfois que c'est la seule mani√®re de les faire taire
Ces pens√©es qui nous font vivre un enfer
Ces pens√©es qui me font vivre un enfer
Est-c'qu'y a que moi qui ai la t√©l√©
Et la cha√Æne culpabilit√©?
Mais faut bien s'changer les id√©es
Pas trop quand m√™me
Sinon √ßa r'part vite dans la t√™te
Et c'est trop tard pour qu'√ßa s'arr√™te
C'est l√† qu'j'aimerais tout oublier
Du coup
J'ai parfois eu des pens√©es suicidaires
Et j'en suis peu fier
On croit parfois que c'est la seule mani√®re de les faire taire
Ces pens√©es qui me font vivre un enfer
Ces pens√©es qui me font vivre un enfer
Tu sais j'ai m√ªrement r√©fl√©chi
Et je sais vraiment pas quoi faire de toi
Justement, r√©fl√©chir
C'est bien l'probl√®me avec toi
Tu sais j'ai m√ªrement r√©fl√©chi
Et je sais vraiment pas quoi faire de toi
Justement, r√©fl√©chir
C'est bien l'probl√®me avec toi

LYRICS (FR) 
√ätre seul c‚Äôest difficile
Et l√†, √ßa fait des ann√©es
Et de juger c‚Äôest facile
Surtout quand on n‚Äôy a pas go√ªt√©
Le plus dur, ben, c‚Äô√©tait la premi√®re fois 
Puis le plus dur, c‚Äôest de savoir quand s‚Äôra la derni√®re fois
C‚Äôest vrai, j‚Äôsuis pas contre un peu d‚Äôtendresse de temps en temps
Et puis, cette fois-ci, ben, j‚Äôpourrais l‚Äôfaire en l‚Äôinsultant
Oui tout est n√©gociable dans la vie, moyennant paiement
En plus j‚Äôsuis s√ªrement son meilleur client
 
Refrain
Mais OH ! 
Laissez donc ma maman
Oui je sais. C‚Äôest vrai qu‚Äôelle n‚Äôest pas parfaite
C‚Äôest un h√©ros
Et ce sera toujours fi√®rement que j‚Äôen parlerai
Que j‚Äôen parlerai
 
J‚Äôsuis un fils de pute, comme ils disent
Apr√®s tout c‚Äôqu‚Äôelle a fait pour eux
Pardonne leur b√™tise
√î ch√®re m√®re !
Ils te d√©shumanisent
C‚Äôest plus facile
Les m√™mes te courtisent
Et tout l‚Äômonde ferme les yeux
 
Pourquoi tout le monde me d√©teste ? 
Alors qu‚Äôc‚Äôest moi qui les nourris
Leurs vies seraient bien plus modestes
Sans moi, elles s‚Äôraient pourries
Le lit et la s√©curit√© 
Ont un prix Madame
Ben oui dans la vie tout se paie
On n‚Äôte l‚Äôavait donc jamais appris
On m‚Äôaccuse de faire de la traite d‚Äô√™tres humains
Mais 50, 40, 30 ou 20 %, c‚Äôest d√©j√† bien
Faudrait pas qu‚Äôelles se prennent un peu trop pour des mannequins
Mesdames, ou devrais-je dire putains ! 
 
Refrain
 
Je sais qu‚Äôc‚Äôest ton boulot
Mais faut bien qu‚Äôj‚Äôfasse le mien, non ? 
Entre l‚Äôtien et le mien
La diff√©rence, c‚Äôest que moi je paie des imp√¥ts
Allez, circulez, Madame
Reprends tes papiers et c‚Äôqui te reste de dignit√©
Pauvre femme, pffff
Trouve-toi un vrai m√©tier !

LYRICS (FR)

[Couplet 1]
Il est l'heure, fini l'heure de danser
Danse, t'inqui√®te pas tu vas danser
Balance-toi, mais tu vas te faire balancer
D√©fonce-toi, mais tu vas te faire d√©foncer

[Refrain]
Tu aimerais faire ta f√™te
Ta m√®re veut te la faire aussi, ta f√™te
Le juge voudrait te faire ta f√™te
Tout le monde te fera aussi ta f√™te

[Couplet 2]
Tu sors trop, du moins c'est ce qu'ils disent
Ils parlent trop, c'est pourquoi tes oreilles sifflent
√Ä qui la faute ? C'est la faute √† autrui, hein ?
C'est les autres, toi tu n'as qu'une seule envie

[Refrain]
Tu aimerais faire ta f√™te
Ta m√®re veut te la faire aussi, ta f√™te
Le juge voudrait te faire ta f√™te
Tout le monde te fera aussi ta f√™te

[Outro]
Tu aimerais faire ta f√™te

Lyrics:

Yeah, you can be the greatest
You can be the best
You can be the King Kong banging on your chest

You can beat the world
You can beat the war
You can talk to God, go banging on his door

You can throw your hands up
You can beat the clock (yeah)
You can move a mountain
You can break rocks
You can be a master
Don't wait for luck
Dedicate yourself and you gon' find yourself

Standing in the hall of fame (yeah)
And the world's gonna know your name (yeah)
'Cause you burn with the brightest flame (yeah)
And the world's gonna know your name (yeah)

Lyrics:

Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?

Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke √¢?? I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

[Chorus:]
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street

So I'm not moving, I'm not moving

Policeman says, Son, you can't stay here.
I said, There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year.
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows.
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go.

Lyrics:

I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
Just prayed to a God that I don't believe in
'Cause I got time while she got freedom
'Cause when a heart breaks, no, it don't break even

Her best days were some of my worst
She finally met a man that's gonna put her first
While I'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping
'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even... even... no

What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you?
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're OK?
I'm falling to pieces, yeah,
I'm falling to pieces

They say bad things happen for a reason
But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding
'Cause she's moved on while I'm still grieving
And when a heart breaks no it don't break even, even... no

What am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you?
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're OK?
I'm falling to pieces, yeah,
I'm falling to pieces, yeah,
I'm falling to pieces
(One still in love while the other one's leaving)
I'm falling to pieces
('Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even)

Lyrics

She's all laid up in bed with a broken heart
While I'm drinking Jack all alone in my local bar
And we don't know how, how we got into this mad situation
Only doing things out of frustration
Trying to make it work, but man, these times are hard

She needs me now, but I can't seem to find the time
I got a new job now on the unemployment line
And we don't know how, how we got into this mess
Is it God's test?
Someone help us, 'cause we're doing our best
Trying to make it work, but, man, these times are hard

But we're gonna start by
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while, a while, yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears, even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time

She's in line at the dole with her head held high
While I just lost my job, but didn't lose my pride
And we both know how, how we're going to make it work when it hurts
When you pick yourself up you get kicked to the dirt
Trying to make it work, but, man, these times are hard

But we're gonna start by
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Doing things we haven't for a while, a while, yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears, even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time

Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while
We're smiling but we're close to tears, even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time

For the first time
Oh, for the first time
Yeah, for the first time
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time

Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby

Yeah, they're making us crazy

Lyrics:

(Oh if you could see me now)

(Oh if you could see me now)

It was February 14 Valentine's Day
The roses came but they took you away
Tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm
Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is you're gone
And I'll never get to show you these songs
Dad you should see the tours that I'm on
I see you standing there next to Mom
Both singing along, yeah arm in arm
Now there are days when I'm losing my faith
Because the man wasn't good he was great
He'd say Music was the home for your pain
And explain I was young, he would say
Take that rage, put it on a page
Take the page to the stage
Blow the roof off the place
I'm trying to make you proud
Do everything you did
I hope you're up there with God saying That's my kid!

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)""",True,True,126716803.0,Error

Lyrics

I think I want you more than want
And know I need you more than need
I wanna hold you more than hold
When you stood in front of me
I think you know me more than know
And you see me more than see
I could die now more than die
Every time you look at me

Well I've seen you in jeans with no make-up on
And I've stood there in awe as your date for the prom
I'm blessed as a man to have seen you in white
But I've never seen anything quite like you tonight
No, I've never seen anything quite like you

When it's right it's more than right
Cause you feel it more than feel
I could take this moment now
Right into the grave with me

Oh well I've seen you in jeans with no make-up on
And I've stood there in awe as your date for the prom
I'm blessed as a man to have seen you in white
But I've never seen anything quite like you tonight
No, I've never seen anything quite like you tonight
No, I've never seen anything quite like you tonight

In your eyes oh in your eyes
In our hearts yeah in our hearts
Sometimes words just ain't enough
For this love that's more than love

Well I've seen you in jeans with no make-up on
And I've stood there in awe as your date for the prom
I'm blessed as a man to have seen you in white
But I've never seen anything quite like you tonight

Lyrics:

Am I better off dead?
Am I better off a quitter?
They say I'm better off now
Than I ever was with her
As they take me to my local down the street
I'm smiling but I'm dying trying not to drag my feet

They say a few drinks will help me to forget her
But after one too many I know that I'll never
Only they can't see where this is gonna end
They all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense

And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change her mind, turn it all around

And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
So I, dialed her number and confessed to her
I'm still in love but all I heard
Was nothing (nothing, nothing, nothing)

Note from Ryan Lewis:

It seems like when a music video comes out, the title that receives all of the credit and travels with a film is that of the director. It's as though the director is the ""artist"" or ""creator"" of the music video, when in reality a music video is first a written treatment, produced (putting together ingredients like actors and locations), shot and directed, cut on the editing board and finally color graded. The music might be fine tuned and scored specifically for that film. There are so many variables that are completely equal if not sometimes more complicated than directing, it's a shame that so much credit comes down to whoever fulfills that position. A director wouldn't have shit to direct without a producer. A producer would have nothing to produce without a writer, and so forth. 

For our team, I think it's even more complicated because roles tend to cross over. We simply don't work within the conventional hierarchy of the film industry (director, producer, etc.) Sure, people have concrete pre-defined roles based on their expertise, but our team has the remarkable ability to wear multiple hats. Can't Hold Us was a video that showcased this well. 

After three months of shooting, finally getting to those last few frames where you reveal the credits, it's a tense moment. There isn't exactly a sensible way to do it, if we're trying to fit people into classic film roles. It leads me to the point that although we do our best to give people titles, this was a video fully created by seven individuals at the forefront. Take any of those people out of the equation, you'd be watching a very different video. I write this in hopes that you don't fall under the illusion that one person creates a music video, particularly at the Macklemore camp. We are constantly challenging and enhancing each others ideas and I take pride in believing that's the reason we make great videos. - Ryan Lewis

I wish that I could say that I was in a ‚Äúbetter place‚Äù when I found out the news.  It would make for a far more polished and respectable story.  But I think back to that night: praying on the floor at 2am as Tricia went to the bathroom to take the pregnancy test I‚Äôd just purchased from Walgreens.  I was scared.  Scared to start working on new music.  Scared of trying again and failing.  Scared of the process of staring at myself through a page and seeing someone that I wasn‚Äôt proud of.  Someone that I didn‚Äôt like.  Someone that wasn‚Äôt ready to be a dad.

I‚Äôve always had some make-believe image in my head of who I would be as a father.  I held on to clear expectations of where I wanted be in my career, my age, my level of self-care, and my maturity.  I basically assumed that I'd have it all together.  But in actuality the hypothetical ‚Äúdad"" version of me looked completely different than the man whose heart was beating out of his chest on the carpet, praying to a god or spirit I hadn‚Äôt talked to in months.  When Tricia walked out of the bathroom, I knew. And I knew I had to change.

5 months later we were recording in a remote cabin away from the density that is Seattle.  I was finally having fun in the studio for the first time in years.  Songs were getting made, finally. I was going back to the city once a week to attend a birthing class with Tricia.  When I got back to the cabin the next day, Ryan had made a new beat that would eventually become the song you‚Äôre listening to.  Half of it is advice about growing up.  The other half is trying to figure out how to grow up myself.

When you try to escape yourself, life has an interesting way of creating situations that force you to come back.  To look at who you are.  This is why ‚ÄúGrowing up‚Äù felt like the right song to re-emerge with.  It‚Äôs where I‚Äôve been the last year, through all the ups and downs.   We didn‚Äôt want to do a big campaign or anything over the top with this.  We just wanted to put out good music, directly to the people that have been here since the beginning.  Thank you for your patience. Hope you enjoy.

And if you‚Äôre wondering‚Ä¶

Our daughter, Sloane Ava Simone Haggerty was born 2 months ago on May 29th.  There is nothing like the joy and happiness that comes from bringing a baby into this universe.  She has filled my heart in ways that I never knew were possible.  She is the love of my life.  This song is for her. 

- Ben

I was always invisible
Consequences are difficult to face
Could‚Äôve been something beautiful

Am I keeping you up at night?
Keeping you up at night?
I‚Äôll never let you be, no!
 
Are you thinking of me when you‚Äôre with somebody else?
Do you talk to me when you‚Äôre talking to yourself?
Are you reaching for me, making love to someone else?
Do you talk to me when you‚Äôre talking to yourself, self?
 
When you‚Äôre talking to your-
Talk to me
When you‚Äôre talking to yourself
 
You were never just miserable
Without taking me with you all the way
Don‚Äôt it hit you subliminal
Now that I‚Äôm not the only one who‚Äôs taking the blame?
 
So tell me what you got on your mind
What you got on your mind?

I‚Äôve had one of those bad dreams
Where we‚Äôre standing on your street
I quit smoking those cigarettes
But I‚Äôm never getting over it

And you‚Äôre looking right through me
Just like Shakespeare wrote a tragedy
‚ÄòBout our story never finished it
‚ÄòCause our love we never finished it

I‚Äôm coming over tonight
Knock on your door just like before
I need that look in your eyes
‚ÄòCause we‚Äôve had the loneliest time

I‚Äôm thinking over the night
I could be yours just like before
Rewrite another try
‚ÄòCause we‚Äôve had the loneliest time

(If you wanna try it, if you wanna try me,
If you wanna try love, baby leave the light on for me,
If you wanna try it, if you wanna try me,
If you wanna try love)

I‚Äôve had more of those bad dreams
You were ten feet in front of me
I went running but I couldn‚Äôt catch
Just the shadow of your silhouette

Then you spoke the words to me
When you left, I still need to unpack it
Let‚Äôs save sorry for another night
‚ÄòCause this time love, we‚Äôre gonna get it right

I‚Äôm coming over tonight
Knock on your door just like before
I need that look in your eyes
‚ÄòCause we‚Äôve had the loneliest time

I‚Äôm thinking over the night
I could be yours just like before
Rewrite another try
‚ÄòCause we‚Äôve had the loneliest time

(If you wanna try it, if you wanna try me,
If you wanna try love, baby leave the light on for me,
If you wanna try it, if you wanna try me,
If you wanna try love, baby leave the light on for me)

What happened was
We reached the moon
But lost in space I think we got there all too soon
But you know what
I‚Äôm coming back for you baby
I‚Äôm coming back for you

And in the morning
Sun hits the water
Is this nirvana?

And in the morning
Sun hits the water
Is this nirvana?

And in the morning
Sun hits the water
Is this nirvana?

So I‚Äôve been trying hard to open up 
When I lost someone it hit me rough
I paid to toughen up in therapy
She said to me, ‚Äúsoften up‚Äù

I‚Äôm sorry if I push your good away
Especially when I‚Äôm needing you to stay
I know you hate that I still test your love
I‚Äôm trying not to fuck this up

But the benefit of all the broken hearts that I broke before they could break me
Is a little bit of life regrets I won‚Äôt bring that mess to you when you‚Äôre with me
And I wanna be brave enough to show you my not-so-perfect family 
And I wanna be brave enough for everything

Surrender my heart 
I‚Äôm out here in the open 
I wanna get closer
I‚Äôll believe in you every night

Surrender my heart
I wanna be open 
I wanna be honest with you

I used to soldier through my hardest days
I used to switch it off, ignore the pain
I craved to feel it all entirely in your arms, baby

But the benefit of all the broken hearts that I broke before they could break me
Is a little bit of life regrets I won‚Äôt bring that mess to you when you‚Äôre with me
And I wanna be brave enough to show you my not-so-perfect family 
And I wanna be brave enough for everything

Surrender my heart 
I‚Äôm out here in the open 
I wanna get closer
I‚Äôll believe in you every night

Surrender my heart
I wanna be open 
I wanna be honest with you

I‚Äôll believe in you every night 
Every night 
Every night 
I‚Äôll believe in you every night
(I‚Äôll believe in you every night)
Every night
Every night
I‚Äôll believe in you every night

Surrender my heart
(I‚Äôm out here in the open)
I wanna get closer

Boy #1 made a picnic for two
Saw he was nervous, I thought it was cute
Until I found out that his mom made the food
(It was good though)
 
Boy #2 had a beautiful face
Highly agreed to go back to his place
His wife really had some impeccable taste
(She was sweet though)
 
I‚Äôve been on this ride
This rollercoaster‚Äôs
A carousel
And I‚Äôm getting nowhere
 
Boys around the world
I want to believe that
When you chase a girl
It‚Äôs not just hunting season
I can see the future, say it like you mean it
 
I‚Äôve got a beach house in Malibu
And I‚Äôm probably gonna hurt your feelings
I‚Äôm probably gonna hurt your feelings
I‚Äôm probably gonna hurt you
 
Boy #12 had a look in his eye
Brought up his ex and he started to cry
Told me he loved me the very first night
(Oh no)
 
Who knows what I‚Äôm in for with boy #
I can‚Äôt keep count anymore
 
I‚Äôve been on this ride
This rollercoaster‚Äôs
A carousel
And I‚Äôm getting nowhere
 
Boys around the world
I want to believe that
When you chase a girl
It‚Äôs not just hunting season
I can see the future, say it like you mean it
 
I‚Äôve got a beach house in Malibu
And I‚Äôm probably gonna hurt your feelings
 
I‚Äôm probably gonna hurt you
 
I‚Äôve got a weekend in paradise and
I‚Äôm probably gonna never call you
 
I‚Äôm probably gonna hurt you
 
I got big plans to take care of you,
I just need to borrow ten thousand dollars
 
I‚Äôm probably gonna hurt you
 
I‚Äôve got a lake house in Canada and
I‚Äôm probably gonna harvest your organs
 
I‚Äôm probably gonna hurt you
 
I‚Äôve got a beach house in Malibu
And I‚Äôm probably gonna hurt your feelings

Smudged red lipstick on you
I‚Äôm so satisfied
We spilled that coffee cup
On my couch a thousand times

Oh now I smile at strangers
I‚Äôm that annoying type
Who don‚Äôt care if there‚Äôs traffic
Cause I‚Äôve got plans tonight

Later we‚Äôll meet at your place
Later we‚Äôll be together ah ah
Ever since you said that you were mine

Everything‚Äôs going my way
And I like to get my way
Even when things go sideways
Raining on my parade
I get all my confidence from you
I get all my confidence from you
Mmmm

One more cute disaster
Said, ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù twice
Before you could even answer
It‚Äôs hard here in paradise

I‚Äôm living to look at your face
Living it up together
Ever since you said that you were mine

Everything‚Äôs going my way
And I like to get my way
Even when things go sideways
Raining on my parade
I get all my confidence from you
I get all my confidence from you
Mmm

Ever since you said la da da da da

Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls

Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up, his daddy, daddy had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us, I don't see us ever being together
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers

But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control, over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up, and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper-lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise momma's gon' be alright

Huh, it's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said, ""Some of 'em were from me, 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em""
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause daddy felt like a bum
See daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom

And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block
And your Mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you, so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it

And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot, so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one-bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara

And that's when daddy went to California with his C.D
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V
And momma didn't like it, and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it

I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing, lookin' at your baby pictures
It just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown
It's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and daddy's still here
Laney, I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, It's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper-lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright

And if you ask me too
Daddy's gonna buy you a Mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that Mockingbird don't sing, and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdies neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad (haha)

MAGIC Lyrics:

[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus]
Feeling like I'm floating to the ceiling, is it magic?
Baby, tell me why you disappearin', this is magic
I won't ever tell 'em how I did it, it was magic
Can you imagine?
Money in the mattress, love the way I stack it
I can make it rain blue hundreds, can you catch it?
If somebody come through bluffin', I'ma blast 'em
And tell the police I don't know what happened

[Verse 1]
If I gave a fuck about a citch, I'd always be broke
I'd never get to pull up in a Benz with my locs
Growin' up, we was poor, so we hopped off that porch
With a gun, tryna blow, tryna kick down your door
But that's old news, spreading love now
Sick of police lights, sick of gun sounds
Niggas' bread ain't up, so they come foul
But it's handshakes, hugs when I come 'round, wow
Funny style, hate to see a nigga smilin'
Hundred miles and runnin' through the public housin'
Movin' mountains, fuck who I was stumpin' down with
Gunnin' down shit, sittin' in the back of Crown Vics
So janky, know them niggas down the street still hate me
Hope lil' baby know that she can't play me
Dumb ho, love cost but the game free, dumb ho

[Chorus]
Feeling like I'm floating to the ceiling, is it magic?
Baby, tell me why you disappearin', this is magic
I won't ever tell 'em how I did it, it was magic
Can you imagine?
Money in the mattress, love the way I stack it
I can make it rain blue hundreds, can you catch it?
If somebody come through bluffin', I'ma blast 'em
And tell the police I don't know what happened

[Verse 2]
Crip and blood shit
That's the only thing I ever been in love with
So I hope he know we never goin' public
Hands full so I can't hold grudges, nah
I be thuggin', jumpin' out the backseat bustin'
Everybody we be beefin' with be sayin' that they bleedin' shit
But see us and they don't do nothin'
Aw, put it on the dead locs
They know I been 'bout it-'bout it since the get-go
If I hit the corner clickin', better get low
You ain't with it nigga, what you from the set for? Huh?
I just wanna be successful
You won't never ever see me with my head low
Momma met my daddy, then they had me in the ghetto
Handed me a thirty-eight and told me I was special, norf

[Chorus]
Feeling like I'm floating to the ceiling, is it magic?
Baby, tell me why you disappearin', this is magic
I won't ever tell 'em how I did it, it was magic
Can you imagine?
Money in the mattress, love the way I stack it
I can make it rain blue hundreds, can you catch it?
If somebody come through bluffin', I'ma blast 'em
And tell the police I don't know what happened
Feeling like I'm floating to the ceiling, is it magic?
Baby, tell me why you disappearin', this is magic
I won't ever tell 'em how I did it, it was magic
Can you imagine?
Money in the mattress, love the way I stack it
I can make it rain blue hundreds, can you catch it?
If somebody come through bluffin', I'ma blast 'em
And tell the police I don't know what happened

[Outro: Mustard]
See when you come from nothing, make it into something, I call that luck
But when you come from where we come from, I call that magic
And when you get two niggas from different sides of the city, to do something like this, I guess you could call that magic
Getting off of Section 8, welfare
Now it's Rolls Royces, private jets, that's magic
Let me know what's magic to you, yeah

Bharna voh jaaney

Koi kaisey unhey yeh samjhaaye
Sabar karney se hi phalta pyaar hai 
Jaaney balma ghodey pe kyun sawaar hain 
Jaaney balma ghodey pe kyun sawaar hain

Ho, doobti hai tujh mein aaj meri kashti 
Guftagu mein utri baat ki tarah

Ho, dekh ke tujhey hi raat ki hawa ne 
Saans thaam li hai haath ke tarah Haaye 
Ki aankhon mein teri raat ki nadi

Yeh baazi to haari hai sau feesadi
hmmm....
Ho, uth gaye kadam toh

Aankh jhuk rahi hai

Jaisey koyi gehri baat ho yahaan
Ho, kho rahey hain dono ek doosrey mein

Jaisey sardiyon ki shaam mein dhuan haaye 
Yeh paani bhi tera aaina hua

Sitaron mein tujhko
hai gina hua
hmmm...
Bikharney ka mujhko shauq hai bada Sameitega mujhko tu bata zara Zara...

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Are you hurting and broken within?
Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?
Jesus is calling
Have you come to the end of yourself
Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
Jesus is calling

[Chorus]
O come to the altar
The Father's arms are open wideForgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ

[Verse 2]
Leave behind your regrets and mistakes
Come today, there's no reason to wait
Jesus is calling
Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy
From the ashes, a new life is born
Jesus is calling

[Bridge]
Oh what a Savior
Isn't He wonderful?
Sing Hallelujah, Christ is risen
Bow down before Him
For He is Lord of all
Sing Hallelujah, Christ is risen

[Verse 3]
Bear your cross as you wait for the crown
Tell the world of the treasure you found

Letras: 
[Verso 1]
Si abatido y dolido est√°s
Y cansado del peso cargar
Cristo nos llama
Si al final del camino est√°s
Sin saber hacia d√≥nde mirar
Cristo nos llama

[Coro]
Ven ante su trono
El Padre te recibir√°
Con sangre preciosa
Jes√∫s borr√≥ nuestra maldad

[Verso 2]
Deja atr√°s tu verg√ºenza y pesar
Ven a El ya no esperes m√°s
Cristo nos llama
Trae toda tristeza al altar
Nueva Vida Jes√∫s te dar√°
Cristo nos llama

[Puente]
Oh cu√°n hermoso
Es nuestro Salvador
Canta aleluya, Cristo vive
Nadie es m√°s grande
Solo √âl es el Se√±or
Canta aleluya, Cristo vive

Lyrics:
I‚Äôm calling on the God of Jacob
Whose love endures through generations 
I know that You will keep Your covenant
     
I‚Äôm calling on the God of Moses
The one who opened up the ocean
I need You now to do the same thing for me
   
O God my God I need You
O God my God I need You now
How I need You now
O Rock O Rock of ages
I‚Äôm standing on Your faithfulness

I'm calling on the God of Mary
Whose favor rests upon the lowly
I know with You all things are possible

I'm calling on the God of David
Who made a shepherd boy courageous
I may not face Goliath
But I've got my own giants 

You heard Your children then 
You hear Your children now
You are the same God 
You are the same God
     
You answered prayers back then
And You will answer now
You are the same God
You are the same God
     
You were providing then
You are providing now
You are the same God
You are the same God

You moved in power then
God move in power now
You are the same God
You are the same God

You were a healer then
You are a healer now
You are the same God
You are the same God   
   
You were a Savior then
You are a Savior now
You are the same God
You are the same God 

You freed the captives then
You‚Äôre freeing hearts right now
You are the same God
You are the same God
     
You touched the lepers then
I feel Your touch right now
You are the same God
You are the same God 

I‚Äôm calling on the Holy Spirit 
Almighty River come and fill me again

Lyrics:
I‚Äôll never be more loved than I am right now
Wasn‚Äôt holding You up so there‚Äôs nothing I can do to let You down
Doesn‚Äôt take a trophy to make You proud
I‚Äôll never be more loved than I am right now

Going through a storm but I won‚Äôt go down
I hear Your voice carried in the rhythm of the wind to call me out
You would cross an ocean so I wouldn‚Äôt drown
You‚Äôve never been closer than You are right now

Jireh You are enough
Jireh You are enough
I will be content in every circumstance
Jireh You are enough

Don‚Äôt wanna forget how I feel right now
On the mountaintop I can see so clear what it‚Äôs all about
Stay by my side when the sun goes down
Don‚Äôt wanna forget how I feel right now

I‚Äôm already loved
I‚Äôm already chosen
I know who I am
I know what You‚Äôve spoken
I‚Äôm already loved
More than I could imagine
And that is enough

That is enough
You are enough
So I am enough

If He dresses the lilies with beauty and splendor
How much more will He clothe you
How much more will He clothe you
If He watches over every sparrow
How much more does He love you
How much more does He love you

More than you ask, think or imagine
According to His power working in us
It‚Äôs more than enough

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Walking around these wallsI thought by now they'd fall
But You have never failed me yet
Waiting for change to come
Knowing the battle's won
For You have never failed me yet

[Chorus 1]
Your promise still stands
Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness
I'm still in Your hands
This is my confidence, You've never failed me yet

[Verse 2]
I know the night won't last
Your Word will come to pass
My heart will sing Your praise again
Jesus, You're still enough
Keep me within Your love
My heart will sing Your praise again

[Chorus 2]
Your promise still stands
Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness
I'm still in Your hands
This is my confidence, You've never failed
Your promise still stands
Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness
I'm still in Your hands
This is my confidence, You've never failed me yet

[Bridge]
I've seen You move, You move the mountains
And I believe, I'll see You do it again
You made a way, where there was no way
And I believe, I'll see You do it again
I've seen You move, You move the mountains
And I believe, I'll see You do it again
You made a way, where there was no way
And I believe, I'll see You do it again
I've seen You move, You move the mountains
And I believe, I'll see You do it again
You made a way, where there was no way
And I believe, I'll see You do it again
I'll see You do it again

[Chorus 2]
Your promise still stands
Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness
I'm still in Your hands
This is my confidence, You've never failed
Your promise still stands
Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness
I'm still in Your hands
This is my confidence, You've never failed me yet

[Outro]
Oh, You've never failed me yet
And I never will forget
You've never failed me yet
And I never will forget

Lyrics:
God of Jacob
Great I Am
King of Angels
Son of Man
Voice of many waters
Song of heaven‚Äôs throne
Louder than the thunder
Make Your glory known

Hail Hail Lion of Judah
Let the Lion roar

Pride of Zion
Prophets spoke
Our Messiah
Flesh and bone
You alone are worthy
To open up the scroll
Like a lamb You suffered
But the Lion has arose

Prepare the way
Prepare the way of the Lord

O valley be raised up
O mountain be made low

Lyrics:
The Lord bless you
And keep you
Make His face shine upon you
And be gracious to you
The Lord turn His
Face toward you
And give you peace

Amen

May His favor be upon you
And a thousand generations
And your family
And your children
And their children
And their children

May His presence go before you
And behind you
And beside you
All around you
And within you
He is with you
He is with you

In the morning
In the evening
In your coming
And your going
In your weeping
And rejoicing
He is for you
He is for you

He is for you

Lyrics: 
The weapon may be formed but it won‚Äôt prosper
When the darkness falls it won‚Äôt prevail
Cause the God I serve knows only how to triumph 
My God will never fail

I‚Äôm gonna see a victory
For the battle belongs to You Lord

There‚Äôs power in the mighty name of Jesus 
Every war He wages He will win
I‚Äôm not backing down from any giant
I know how this story ends

You take what the enemy meant for evil
And You turn it for good
You turn it for good

Lyrics:
I searched the world
But it couldn‚Äôt fill me
Man‚Äôs empty praise
and treasures that fade
Are never enough

Then You came along
And put me back together
And every desire is now satisfied
Here in Your love

Oh there‚Äôs nothing better than You
There‚Äôs nothing better than You
Lord there‚Äôs nothing, nothing is better
than You

I‚Äôm not afraid
To show You my weakness
My failures and flaws
Lord You‚Äôve seen them all
And You still call me friend

‚ÄòCause the God of the mountain
Is the God of the valley
There‚Äôs not a place
Your mercy and grace
Won‚Äôt find me again

You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory
You‚Äôre the only one who can

You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways
You‚Äôre the only one who can
You‚Äôre the only one who can

Lyrics:
All my life I‚Äôve been carried by grace
Don‚Äôt ask me how cause I can‚Äôt explain
It's nothing short of a miracle I'm here

I've got some blessings that I don't deserve
I've got some scars but that's how you learn
It's nothing short of a miracle I'm here

I think it over and it doesn‚Äôt add up
I know it comes from above

I've got miracles on miracles
A million little miracles
Miracles on miracles
Count your miracles
1-2-3-4 I can‚Äôt even count 'em all

You held me steady so I wouldn‚Äôt give up
You opened doors that nobody could shut
I hope I never get over what You‚Äôve done

I wanna live with an open heart
I wanna live like I know who You are
I hope I never get over what You‚Äôve done

It's not coincidence and it's not luck
I know it comes from above

I can't even, I can't even count 'em all
I can't even, I can't even count 'em all
I can't even, I can't even count 'em all
1-2-3-4 I can‚Äôt even count 'em all

Lyrics:
I don‚Äôt believe in fairy tales
I guess I‚Äôve outgrown them
But that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt believe that there‚Äôs something bigger than me
Cause I‚Äôve seen it in a hospital room 
When the doctor said 
Sorry there‚Äôs nothing more we can do
Well it wasn‚Äôt through

I‚Äôve never seen a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow
But I‚Äôve got a promise I can hold in the middle of the struggle
God if you said it You‚Äôll perform it
May not be how I want You to
But here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do

I‚Äôm gonna wait on You
I‚Äôm gonna wait on You
I‚Äôve tasted Your goodness
I‚Äôll trust in Your promise
I‚Äôm gonna wait on You

I know You‚Äôve ordered every step
Yeah, You are the Author
And there‚Äôs no predicting what is next
But You hold the future
And all the questions they come second to the one I know is true
You‚Äôve always been true

Wait on the Lord
Wait on the Lord
He will renew your strength
So wait I say

For centuries, the greatest sailors in the world masterfully navigated the vast Pacific, discovering the many islands of Oceania. But then, 3,000 years ago, their voyages stopped for a millennium ‚Äì and no one knows exactly why. From Walt Disney Animation Studios comes ‚ÄúMoana,‚Äù a sweeping, CG-animated feature film about an adventurous teenager who is inspired to leave the safety and security of her island on a daring journey to save her people. Inexplicably drawn to the ocean, Moana (voice of Auli ªi Cravalho) convinces the mighty demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson) to join her mission, and he reluctantly helps her become a wayfinder like her ancestors who sailed before her. Together, they voyage across the open ocean on an action-packed adventure, encountering enormous monsters and impossible odds, and along the way, Moana fulfills her quest and discovers the one thing she‚Äôs always sought: her own identity. Directed by the renowned filmmaking team of Ron Clements and John Musker (‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid,‚Äù ‚ÄúAladdin,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Princess & the Frog‚Äù), produced by Osnat Shurer (‚ÄúLifted,‚Äù ‚ÄúOne Man Band‚Äù), and featuring music by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa‚Äòi, ‚ÄúMoana‚Äù sailed into U.S. theaters on Nov. 23, 2016.

this is something different. i hope you guys like it. this song is a confession and an apology. honest, not sarcastic.

music and lyrics by bo burnham.

lyrics

art is dead, art is dead 
art is dead, art is dead 

entertainers like to seem complicated 
but we're not complicated 
i can explain it pretty easily 
have you ever been to a birthday party for children 
and one of the children won't stop screaming 
cause he's just a little attention attractor 
when he grows up to be a comic or actor 
he'll be rewarded for never maturing 
for never understanding or learning 
that every day can't be about him
there's other people you selfish asshole

i must be psychotic, i must be demented 
to think that i'm worthy of all this attention, 
of all of this money you worked really hard for 
i slept in late while you worked at the drug store.
my drug's attention, i am an addict 
but i get paid to indulge in my habit 
it's all an illusion, i'm wearing make-up 
i'm wearing make-up, make-up, make-up, make-up 

art is dead, so people think you're funny 
how do you get those people's money? 
art is dead, we're rolling in dough 
while Carlin rolls in his grave, in his grave, in his grave. 

this show has got a budget 
the show has got a budget 
and all the poor people way more deserving of the money won't budge it
cause i wanted my name in lights 
when i could have fed a family of four 
for forty fucking fortnights, forty fucking fortnights 

i am an artist, please god forgive me 
i am an artist, please don't revere me 
i am an artist, please don't respect me 
i am an artist, feel free to correct me 
a self-centered artist, self-obsessed artist 
i am an artist, i am an artist 

but i'm just a kid, i'm just a kid, kid 
and maybe i'll grow out of it",False,False,58836554.0,comedy
