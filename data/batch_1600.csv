Lyrics:
So swallow hard the serpent 
Of many tags and faces hid in masks
Coiled ‘round this lung until the last
He’ll crack your boots young pagans
‘Cause like you I was hatched to traipse on cold 
And 17’s a long drawn way from hope

And I’ve learned these lessons I was taught
Taut, so taught
And now I’m telling you

Return the faith
Return the faith
They’re smashing out the veils
Return the faith
And there’s no escape
So return the faith
With charging light brigades 
Return the faith
You’ve gotta move

So as betrayed by rainbows
Here I convey I’ve sold out your dear cause
And the king has placed us in his jaws
It’s sure no place can hold us
But in this scene I’m December 
And your June’s wretch
And my idyls lay gasping as if death 
And I’ve learned these lessons I was taught
Taut, so taught
And now I’m telling you
And I’ve learned these lessons I was taught
Taut, so taught
And now I’m telling you

Return the faith
Return the faith
They’re smashing out the veils
Return the faith
And there’s no escape
So return the faith
With charging light brigades 
Return the faith
You’ve gotta move

Return the faith
Return the faith

FEEL INVINCIBLE 

Target on my back
Lone survivor lasts
They got me in their sites
No surrender no
Trigger fingers go
living the dangerous life
Hey hey hey everyday when I wake
I'm trying to get up
They're knocking me down
(Chewing me up spitting me out)
Hey hey hey when I need to be saved
You're making me strong
You're making me stand
(Never will fall never will end)

Shot like a rocket up into the sky
Nothing can stop me tonight

You make me feel invincible
Earthquake powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave
You're my titanium
Fight song raising up
Like the roar of victory in a stadium
Who can touch me cause I'm
(I'm made of fire)
Who can stop me tonight
(I'm hard wired)
You make me feel invincible
I feel I feel it
Invincible

Here we go again
I will not give in
I've got a reason to fight
Every day we choose
We might win or lose
This is the dangerous life
Hey hey hey everyday when I wake
They say that I'm gone they say that they've won
(The bell has been rung it's over and done)
Hey hey hey when I need to be saved
They're counting me out but this is my round
(You in my corner look at me now)

You make me feel invincible
Shot like a rocket up into the sky
Not gonna stop
Invincible

NOT GONNA DIE
Death surrounds
My heart beat slowing down
I won't take this world's abuse
I won't give up I refuse

This is how it feels when you're bent and broken
This is how it feels when your dignity's stolen
When everything you love is leaving
You hold on to what you believe in

The last thing I heard
Was you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flat-line

No
Not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
Don't close your eyes
No
Not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we're not gonna die tonight

Break their hold
Cause I won't be controlled
They can't keep their chains on me
When the truth has set me free

This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you finally fight back
When life pushes me, I push harder
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

Don't you give up on me
You're everything I need
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you fight back

Not gonna die

During the summer of COVID-19 we grabbed our masks, hit the studio & began to chip away at what is now known as OK Human. An album that was made by a handful of humans using only analog technologies (including a 38 piece orchestra) for all of you humans to consume. 

OK Human was made at a time when humans-playing-instruments was a thing of the past. All we could do is look back on ancient times when humans really mattered and when the dark tech-takeover fantasy didn’t exist. We used our instruments to connect to the 1960’s and 1970’s and, with the orchestra, back to the 18th and 19th centuries. We had no click track or loops or hi-tech sounds. Not even an electric guitar.

LYRICS

All my favorite songs are slow and sad
All my favorite people make me mad
Everything that feels so good is bad, bad, bad
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
I don’t know what’s wrong with me
I don’t know what’s wrong with me

I love parties but I don’t go
Then I feel bad when I stay home
‘Cause I need a friend when I take a walk
I like spacing out when somebody talks
I wanna be rich but I feel guilty
I fall in love with everyone who hates me

Dreamy morning
Walking along by myself
Thinking about life
Trying’ to find my way through hell
Sometimes I wish I was on an island
But then I’d miss the sound of sirens

I don’t know what’s wrong with me

======= To Hell And Back LYRICS =======

A short man from Texas
A man of the wild
Thrown into combat
Where bodies lie piled

Hides his emotions
His blood’s running cold
Just like his victories,
His story unfolds

Bright
A white light
If there’d be
Any glory in war

Let it rest
On men like him

Dead men will never come back

Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldiers sleep
And where hell’s six feet deep
That death does wait
There’s no debate
So charge and attack
Going to Hell and Back

A man of the 15th
A man of Can Do
Friends fall around him
And yet he came through

Let them fall face down
If they must die
Making it easier
To say goodbye

Bright
A white light
If there’d be,
Any glory in war

Let it rest
On men like him

Who went to Hell and came back

Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldiers sleep
And where hell is six feet deep
That death does wait
There’s no debate
So charge and attack
Going to Hell and Back

Oh gather round me
And listen while I speak
Of a war
Where Hell is six feet deep

And all along the shore
Where cannons still roar
They’re haunting my dreams
They’re still there when I sleep

Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldiers sleep
and where hell is six feet deep
That death does wait
There’s no debate
So charge and attack
Going to Hell and Back

======= The Last Stand LYRICS =======

In the heart of Holy See
In the home of Christianity
The Seat of power is in danger

There's a foe of a thousand swords
They've been abandoned by their lords
Their fall from grace will pave their path, to damnation

Then the 189
In the service of heaven
They’re protecting the holy line
It was 1527, gave their lives on the steps to heaven
Thy will be done!

For the grace, for the might of our lord
For the home of the holy
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Gave their lives so boldly

For the grace, for the might of our lord
In the name of his glory
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Come and tell their story again

Under guard of 42
Along a secret avenue
Castel Saint'Angelo is waiting

They’re the guard of the Holy See
They’re the guards of Christianity
Their path to history is paved with salvation

Dying for salvation with dedication
No Capitulation, annihilation
Papal commendation, reincarnation
Heaven is your destination

In the name of god

Gave their lives so boldly
Come and tell the Swiss guards story again

========= Historic Fact ==========

The outnumbered Swiss Guard, protectors of the Vatican, stood against an invading horde during the Sack of Rome in 1527, giving their lives so the Pope could make his escape.

 Lyrics for ""Stormtroopers""

Now there's a standstill in the war, repeating what's been done before
It must come to an end, a few will transcend
They were under 25, and under fire they would thrive
The Sturmmann is born, their enemies scorn
A glimpse of the future, new tactics in war
New doctrine in combat explored
As fast as lightning, there's no time to mourn
A glimpse of the future and Blitzkrieg is born
Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches the Stormtroopers rise!
Jägers led the way, the pioneers would join the fray
Initiative gained, advancement sustained
Lead through direct command, as they're advancing through the land
Encircling their flanks, and ravage their ranks
Expose their reinforcements, destroying their lines
New doctrine in combat aligns
Infantry attacks, exposing the cracks
New combat ideals, on the Kaiserschlacht's fields
Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches the Stormtroopers rise!
A glimpse of the future, new tactics in war
New doctrine in combat explored
As fast as lightning, there's no time to mourn
A glimpse of the future and Blitzkrieg is born
Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches the Stormtroopers rise!
Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches the Stormtroopers rise!

========= Night Witches LYRICS ==========

From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected

Pushing on and on their planes are going strong
Air force’s number one
Somewhere down below they’re looking for the foe
Bombers on a run
You can’t hide, you can’t move, just abide,
Their attack’s been proved
Raiders in the dark
Silent through the night the Witches join the fight
Never miss their mark

Canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment
588

Undetected
Unexpected
Wings of glory
Tell their story
Aviation
Deviation
Undetected
Stealth perfected

Foes are losing ground, retreating to the sound
Death is in the air
Suddenly appears, confirming all your fears
Strike from Witches lair
Target found, come around, barrels sound
From the battleground
Axis aiming high
Rodina awaits defeat them at the gates
Live to fight and fly

Beneath the starlight of the heavens
Unlikely heroes in the skies
Witches to attack, witches coming back
As they appear on the horizon
The wind will whisper when the Night Witches come

========= Historic Fact ==========

A total of 261 Russian women served as pilots during the lifetime of the 588th Night Bomber Regiment in WWII. They were nicknamed ‘Night Witches’ for their stealthy attacks. 32 of them died in service.

======== ""Bismarck"" LYRICS =======

From the mist a shape, a ship is taking form
And the silence of the sea is about to drift into a storm 
Sign of power, show of force
Raise the anchor battleship plotting its course

Pride of a nation a beast made of steel
Bismarck in motion king of the ocean

He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
To lead the warmachine
To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

Two thousand men, and fifty thousand tonnes of steel
Set the course for the Atlantic with the allies on their heel
Firepower, firefight
Battlestations, keep the targets steady in sight

Into formation, the hunt has begun
Death and damnation, the fleet is coming

He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
To lead the warmachine
To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

At the bottom of the ocean the depths of the abyss
They are bound by iron and blood
The flagship of the navy the terror of the seas
His guns have gone silent at last

Pride of a nation a beast made of steel
Bismarck in motion king of the ocean

He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
To lead the warmachine
To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

To lead the warmachine
Rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine

The terror of the seas
Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

To lead the warmachine
Rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine

The terror of the seas
Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

========= Historic Fact ==========

Ignoring a treaty formed in WWI, Hitler sends his gargantuan battleship on a top secret mission to the Atlantic. Bismarck, named after Otto von Bismarck, Germany’s first Chancellor, was commissioned in 1940 and sank in May 1941 following a battle with the British Royal Navy.

======= Primo Victoria LYRICS =======

Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines
Primo victoria

We’ve been training for years
Now we’re ready to strike
As the great operation begins
We’re the first wave on the shore
We’re the first ones to fall
Yet soldiers have fallen before

In the dawn they will pay
With their lives as the price
History’s written today
In this burning inferno
Know that nothing remains
As our forces advance on the beach

Aiming for heaven though serving in hell
Victory is ours their forces will fall

Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines
Primo victoria

On the 6th of June
On the shores of western Europe 1944
D-day upon us

We’ve been here before
Used to this kind of war
Crossfire grind through the sand
Our orders were easy
It’s kill or be killed
Blood on both sides will be spilled

In the dawn they will pay
With their lives as the price
History’s written today
Now that we are at war
With the axis again
This time we know what will come

6th of June 1944
Allies are turning the war
Normandy state of anarchy
Overlord

========= Historic Fact ==========

A few minutes after midnight on June 6, 1944, the D Day landings commenced in Normandy. The amphibious landings of Allied infantry and armoured divisions were undertaken to open a new front in the war against Nazi Germany and its allies.

========= Father LYRICS ==========

A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?

It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93

Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where’s the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?

Father of toxic gas, and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man’s land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield

“Perversions of ideals of science”
Lost words of alienated wife
And in the trenches of the western front
Unknowing soldiers pay the price

And on the battlefield they’re dying
And on the fields the crops are grown
So who can tell us what is right or wrong
Maths or morality alone?

During times when there’s peace he belonged to the world
During times when there’s war he belonged to his place of birth

Where, will this lead? What’s coming next? 
From your inventions?
We wonder where, where does it end?
Who can foresee, see what will be?


========= Historic Fact ==========

Fritz Haber, often referred to as the “father of chemical warfare”, weaponised lethal gas for the Germans during World War I. Haber is also responsible for the Haber-Bosch process, an invention that resulted in a boom in the world’s population due to a significant increase in agricultural produce.

======== The Attack Of The Dead Men LYRICS =======

Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7, 000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back

And that's when the dead men are marching again

Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again

Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again

Two combatants spar
Hindenburg against the Tsar
Move in 12 battalions large
Into a Russian counter-charge
They'll be fighting for their lives
As their enemy revives
Russians won't surrender, no
Striking fear into their foe

And that's when the dead men are marching again

Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again

Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again

And that's when the dead men are marching again

Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again

Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again

That's when the dead men are marching again and again
That's when the dead march again

========= Historic Fact ==========

In the early morning of August 6, 1915, the German gas batteries opened up and a dark green smog of poison gas crept over the Russian lines at Osowiec Fortress.

========= Ghost Division LYRICS =========

Fast as the wind, the invasion has begun
Shaking the ground with the force of thousand guns
First in the line of fire, first into hostile land
Tanks leading the way, leading the way

Charging the lines with the force of a furious storm
Fast as the lighting phantoms swarm
200 miles at nightfall, taken within a day
Thus earning the name, earning the fame

[Chorus:]
They are the panzer elite, born to compete, never retreat (ghost division)
Living or dead, always ahead, fed by your dread

Always ahead, as the blitzkrieg rages on
Breaking morale with the sound of blazing guns
First in the line of fire, first into hostile land
Tanks leading the way, leading the way

Leaving a trail of destruction through a foreign land
(Waging war with conviction)
Massive assault live to serve the Nazi plan
(Wehrmacht’s pride, ghost division)
Communications broken, phantoms too far away
Thus earning the name, earning the fame

[Chorus]

Pushing the frontline forth with a tremendous force
(Far ahead, breaks resistance)
Breaching the way for panzer corps
(Shows no fear, self-subsistent)
First in the line of fire, first into hostile land
Tanks leading the way, claiming the fame

[Chorus]

Panzer elite, born to compete, never retreat (ghost division)
Living our dead, always ahead, fed by your dread

========= Historic Fact ==========

The 7th Panzer Division invaded Belgium and France in 1940 under the command of Generalmajor Erwin Rommel. The Division was nicknamed 'La Division Fantôme' by the French, which translates into ‘Ghost Division’, for its speed, agility and surprise tactics.

========= Soldier Of Heaven LYRICS ==========

I won’t be coming home
I won’t be going anywhere
I will guard this post forever
Here on the alpine slope where I did my final stand I shall remain
Among the ice and snow that binds me to this mountain

A force of nature too strong, sent from above
Where spirits lead the way, the winds will never fade

White Friday, I’ll take the
Stairway to heaven
I’m sky high, when I die
I’ll be immortal
Forever, I never
I won´t return to
Blood Mountain, I am the
Soldier of heaven

I saw the end of war
I watched the soldiers come and go
And I kept my watch forever
So many brave men fell in the battles that were raging down below
I have seen it all but none will hear my story

All of these years I have been frozen in time
I cried for spring to come but here, winter remain

I always dreamed that I would, serve high above
Where spirits lead the way, the winds will never fade

========= Historic Fact =============

High above in the alps close to heaven, in the most extreme circumstances, men fought and protected the borders during WWI. At 23:30 on April 17, 1916, the Italians, who were up against the Austro-Hungarian Empire, detonated 5,000kg of Nitro-Gelatine to secure the Col di Lana summit.

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Heyy
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey

[Verse 1]
Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

[Interlude]
Heyy
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey

[Verse 2]
Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

[Bridge]
The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be, with me

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do tonight
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it

Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

Lyrics:

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west LA
Or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
Mmm the way you do me
Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by""

Lyrics:

Forever can never be long enough for me
To feel like I've had long enough with you
Forget the world now, we won't let them see
But there's one thing left to do

Now that the weight has lifted
Love has surely shifted my way

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say ""Hello"" in this cafe
Say you will
Mm-hmm
Say you will

Play that song
The one that makes me go allnight long
The one that makes me think of you
That's all you gotta do

Hey mister DJ when you gonna spin it

She been waiting for a minute
She invited all her friends
And I'm buying all the rounds
And they're all dolled up

My head was oversized
I'll take the high road like I should
You said it's meant to be
That it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good

Lyrics:

I need a sign to let me know you're here
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere
I need to know that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup

When there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head
When you feel the world shake from the words that are said

And I'm calling all angels
I'm calling all you angels
I won't give up if you don't give up

All I wanna do when I wake up in the morning is see your eyes
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that a girl like you could ever care for me
Rosanna
All I wanna do in the middle of the evening is hold you tight
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know you were looking for more than I could ever be
Not quite a year since you went away
Rosanna, yeah
Now she's gone, and I have to say
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way
Rosanna, yeah

I can see your face still shining through the window on the other side
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know that a girl like you could make me feel so sad
Rosanna
All I wanna tell you is now you'll never ever have to compromise
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that losing you could ever hurt so bad
Not quite a year since you went away
Rosanna, yeah
Now she's gone, and I have to say
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way
Rosanna, yeah

Not quite a year since you went away

Lyrics:

Some people live their dreams
Some people close their eyes
Some people's destiny
Passes by

There are no guarantees
There are no alibis
That's how our love must be
Don't ask why

It takes some time
God knows how long
I know that I can forget you

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating

Lyrics:

Well I'm walking in my sleep
Well I'm talking baby can't you see
Well all we need is a simple song
For people that wanna dance
All we need is a simple song
So people let me hear you say
Na na na na na

It's not your situation
I just need contemplation over you
I'm not so systematic
It's just that I'm an addict for your love",True,True,52452407.0,progressive rock

Lyrics:

Reflections in my mind
Thought I can't define
My heart is racing and the night goes on
I can almost hear a laugh
Coming from your photograph
Funny how a look can share a thousand meanings
Well intented lies
Contemplainting alibies 
Is it really you or is it me I'm blaming?
A distant memory flashes over me
Even though you're gone I feel you deep inside

Dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes

I can't stop loving you 
Time passes quickly and chances are few
I won't stop till I'm through loving you girl",True,True,64078114.0,pop rock

Lyrics:

Side by side
I'll be yours forever
Yes I will
Rain or shine
Any kind of weather
Any kind

There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
Let's take what's getting old and make it new

Eye to eye
It's a blinding confrontation
I said you and I
are a deadly combination

So don't start mixing truth with jealousy
The road we're on is clear as far as I can see

Pamela
Don't break this heart of mine
Just remember it may not heal this time
Pamela
There is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind",True,True,21918565.0,pop rock

Lyrics:

I was born in the land of the sun 
And the tall green grass
And I don't understand 
How all this has come to pass
How we've come to surround ourselves 
In a sea of thieves
In a land without learning 
Only the fools believe

I went driving last night 
On a dark canyon road
Had the sky to myself 
But I wasn't alone
Had the pain of my lifetime 
For my company
How did it end up like this 
For you and me

When love breaks the promise 
The heart has to keep
It leaves only truth here to find
When the spirit is crushed 
And the hurt is so deep
Between you and I",True,True,21546571.0,soft rock

Dias de Luta, Dias de Glória
(Chorão, Thiago Castanho)

Canto minha vida com orgulho
Na minha vida tudo acontece
Mas quanto mais a gente rala, mais a gente cresce

Hoje estou feliz porque eu sonhei com você
E amanhã posso chorar por não poder te ver

Mas o seu sorriso vale mais que um diamante
Se você vier comigo, aí nós vamos adiante
Com a cabeça erguida e mantendo a fé em Deus
O seu dia mais feliz vai ser o mesmo que o meu

A vida me ensinou a nunca desistir
Nem ganhar, nem perder mas procurar evoluir
Podem me tirar tudo que tenho
Só não podem me tirar as coisas boas que eu já fiz pra quem eu amo

E eu sou feliz e canto e o universo é uma canção
E eu vou que vou

História, nossas histórias
Dias de luta, dias de glória
História, nossas histórias
Dias de luta, dias de glória
História, nossas histórias
Dias de luta, dias de glória
História, nossas histórias
Dias de luta, dias de glória

Oh minha gata, morada dos meus sonhos
Todo dia, se pudesse eu ia estar com você
Já te via muito antes nos meus sonhos
Eu procurei a vida inteira por alguém como você

Por isso eu canto a minha vida com orgulho
Com melodia, alegria e barulho
Eu sou feliz e rodo pelo mundo
Sou correria mas também sou vagabundo

Mas hoje dou valor de verdade pra minha saúde,
Pra minha liberdade
Que bom te encontrar nessa cidade
Esse brilho intenso me lembra você

História, nossas histórias
Dias de luta, dias de glória
História, nossas histórias
Dias de luta, dias de glória
História, nossas histórias
Dias de luta, dias de glória
História, nossas histórias
Dias de luta, dias de glória

Hoje estou feliz, acordei com o pé direito
E vou fazer de novo, vou fazer muito bem feito
Sintonia, telepatia, comunicação pelo córtex, bum bye bye

Letras:

Agora eu sei exatamente o que fazer,
Bom recomeçar, poder contar com você,
Pois eu me lembro de tudo irmão, eu estava lá também,
Um homem quando esta em paz, 
Não quer guerra com ninguém

Eu segurei minhas lágrimas, 
Pois não queria demonstrar a emoção,
Já que estava ali só pra observar 
E aprender um pouco mais sobre a percepção,
Eles dizem que é impossível encontrar o amor 
Sem perder a razão,
Mas pra quem tem pensamento forte, 
O impossível é só questão de opinião

E disso os loucos sabem, só os loucos sabem,
Disso os loucos sabem, só os loucos sabem""",True,True,141560691.0,alternative rock

Que bom viver, como é bom sonhar
E o que ficou pra trás passou e eu não me importei
Foi até melhor, tive que pensar em algo novo que fizesse sentido
Ainda vejo o mundo com os olhos de criança
Que só quer brincar e não tanta ""responsa""
Mas a vida cobra sério e realmente não dá pra fugir
Livre pra poder sorrir, sim
Livre pra poder buscar o meu lugar ao sol
Livre pra poder sorrir, sim
Livre pra poder buscar o meu lugar ao sol
Um dia eu espero te reencontrar numa bem melhor
Cada um tem seu caminho, eu sei foi até melhor
Irmãos do mesmo Cristo, eu quero e não desisto
Caro pai, como é bom ter por que se orgulhar
A vida pode passar, não estou sozinho
Eu sei se eu tiver fé eu volto até a sonhar
Livre pra poder sorrir, sim
Livre pra poder buscar o meu lugar ao sol
Livre pra poder sorrir, sim
Livre pra poder buscar o meu lugar ao sol

LETRA:
Minha mente, nem sempre tão lúcida
É fértil e me deu a voz
Minha mente, nem sempre tão lúcida
Fez ela se afastar, mas ela vai voltar
Mas ela vai voltar

Ela não é
Do tipo de mulher que se entrega na primeira
Mas melhora na segunda e o paraíso é na terceira
Ela tem força, ela tem sensibilidade
Ela é guerreira, ela é uma deusa, ela é mulher de verdade

Ela é daquelas que tu gosta na primeira
Se apaixona na segunda e perde a linha na terceira
Ela é discreta e cultua bons livros
E ama os animais, tá ligado, eu sou o bicho

Minha mente, nem sempre tão lúcida
É fértil e me deu a voz
Minha mente, nem sempre tão lúcida
Fez ela se afastar, mas ela vai voltar
Mas ela vai voltar

Deixa eu te levar pra ver o mundo, baby
Deixa eu te mostrar o melhor que eu posso ser
Deixa eu te levar pra ver o mundo, baby
Deixa eu te mostrar o melhor que eu posso ser

Ela não é
Do tipo de mulher que se entrega na primeira
Mas melhora na segunda e o paraíso é na terceira
Ela tem força, ela tem sensibilidade
Ela é guerreira, ela é uma deusa, ela é mulher de verdade

Ela é daquelas que tu gosta na primeira
Se apaixona na segunda e perde a linha na terceira
Ela é discreta e cultua bons livros
E ama os animais, tá ligado, eu sou o bicho

Minha mente, nem sempre tão lúcida
É fértil e me deu a voz
Minha mente, nem sempre tão lúcida
Fez ela se afastar, mas ela vai voltar
Mas ela vai voltar

Fazer da vida o que melhor possa ser
Traçar um rumo novo em direção ao Sol
Me sinto muito bem quando vejo o pôr-do-Sol
Só pra fazer nascer a Lua

Minha mente, nem sempre tão lúcida
É fértil e me deu a voz
Minha mente, nem sempre tão lúcida
Fez ela se afastar, mas ela vai voltar
Mas ela vai voltar
Mas ela vai voltar
Mas ela vai voltar

LETRA:
Tão natural quanto a luz do dia
Mas que preguiça boa, me deixa aqui à toa
Hoje ninguém vai estragar meu dia
Só vou gastar energia pra beijar sua boca

Fica comigo então, não me abandona não
Alguém te perguntou como é que foi seu dia?
Uma palavra amiga, uma notícia boa
Isso faz falta no dia a dia
A gente nunca sabe quem são essas pessoas

Eu só queria te lembrar
Que aquele tempo eu não podia fazer mais por nós
Eu estava errado e você não tem que me perdoar
Mas também quero te mostrar
Que existe um lado bom nessa história
Tudo que ainda temos a compartilhar

E viver, e cantar
Não importa qual seja o dia
Vamos viver, vadiar
O que importa é nossa alegria
Vamos viver, e cantar
Não importa qual seja o dia
Vamos viver, vadiar
O que importa é nossa alegria

LETRA:
Buscando um novo rumo
Que faça sentido
Nesse mundo louco
Com o coração partido eu
Tomo cuidado
Pra que os desequilibrados
Não abalem minha fé
Pra eu enfrentar com otimismo essa loucura

Os homens podem falar
Mas os anjos podem voar
Quem é de verdade
Sabe quem é de mentira
Não menospreze o dever
Que a consciência te impõe
Não deixe pra depois
Valorize a vida

Resgate suas forças e se sinta bem
Rompendo a sombra da própria loucura
Cuide de quem corre do seu lado
E quem te quer bem
Essa é a coisa mais pura

Fragmentos da realidade
Estilo mundo cão
Tem gente que desanda
Por falta de opção
E toda fé que eu tenho
Eu tô ligado
Que ainda é pouco
Os bandidos de verdade
Tão em Brasília, tudo solto

Eu faço da dificuldade
A minha motivação
A volta por cima
Vem na continuação
O que se leva dessa vida
É o que se vive, é o que se faz
Saber muito é muito pouco
Stay real, esteja em paz

Que importa é se sentir bem
Que importa é fazer o bem
Eu quero ver meu povo todo
Evoluir também

Que importa é se sentir bem
Que importa é fazer o bem
Eu quero ver meu povo todo
Prosperar também

Que importa é se sentir bem
Que importa é fazer o bem
Eu quero ver meu povo todo
Evoluir também
Que importa é se sentir bem

Resgate suas forças e se sinta bem
Rompendo a sombra da própria loucura
Cuide de quem corre do seu lado
E quem te quer bem
Essa é a coisa mais pura

Difícil é entender e viver no paraíso perdido
Mas não seja mais um iludido
Derrotado e sem juízo
Então

Resgate suas forças e se sinta bem
Rompendo a sombra da própria loucura
Cuide de quem corre do seu lado
E quem te quer bem
Essa é a coisa mais pura

Que importa é se sentir bem
Que importa é fazer o bem
Eu quero ver meu povo todo
Evoluir também

Que importa é se sentir bem
Que importa é fazer o bem
Eu quero ver meu povo todo
Prosperar também

Que importa é se sentir bem
Que importa é fazer o bem
Eu quero ver meu povo todo
Evoluir também
Que importa é se sentir bem

Viver, viver e ser livre
Saber dar valor para as coisas mais simples
Só o amor constrói
Pontes indestrutíveis

Letra ROSAS
En un día de estos en que suelo pensar
Hoy va a ser el día menos pensado
Nos hemos cruzado, has decidido mirar
A los ojitos azules que ahora van a tu lado

Desde el momento en el que te conocí
Resumiendo con prisas tiempo de silencio
Te juro que a nadie le he vuelto a decir
Que tenemos el récord del mundo en querernos

Por eso esperaba con la carita empapada
A que llegaras con rosas, con mil rosas para mí
Porque ya sabes que me encantan esas cosas
Que no importa si es muy tonto, soy así

Y aún me parece mentira que se escape mi vida
Imaginando que vuelves a pasarte por aquí
Donde los viernes cada tarde, como siempre
La esperanza dice quieta, hoy quizás sí

Escapando una noche de un bostezo de sol
Me pediste que te diera un beso
Con lo baratos que salen mi amor
Qué te cuesta callarme con uno de esos

Pasaron seis meses y me dijiste adiós
Un placer coincidir en esta vida
Allí me quedé, en una mano el corazón
Y en la otra excusas que ni tú entendías

Por eso esperaba con la carita empapada
A que llegaras con rosas, con mil rosas para mí
Porque ya sabes que me encantan esas cosas
Que no importa si es muy tonto, soy así

Y aún me parece mentira que se escape mi vida
Imaginando que vuelves a pasarte por aquí
Donde los viernes cada tarde, como siempre
La esperanza dice quieta, hoy quizás sí

Y es que empiezo a pensar
Que el amor verdadero es tan sólo el primero
Y es que empiezo a sospechar
Que los demás son sólo para olvidar

Por eso esperaba con la carita empapada
A que llegaras con rosas, con mil rosas para mí
Porque ya sabes que me encantan esas cosas
Que no importa si es muy tonto, soy así

Y aún me parece mentira que se escape mi vida
Imaginando que vuelves a pasarte por aquí
Donde los viernes cada tarde, como siempre

LYRICS LA PLAYA:

No sé si aún me recuerdas
Nos conocimos al tiempo
Tú, el mar y el cielo
Y quien me trajo a ti

Abrazaste mis abrazos
Vigilando aquel momento
Aunque fuera el primero
Y lo guardara para mí

Si pudiera volver a nacer
Te vería cada día amanecer
Sonriendo como cada vez
Como aquella vez

Te voy a escribir la canción más bonita del mundo
Voy a capturar nuestra historia tan solo un segundo
Un día verás que este loco de poco se olvida
Por mucho que pasen los años de largo en su vida

El día de la despedida
De esta playa de mi vida
Te hice una promesa
Volverte a ver así

Más de cincuenta veranos
Hace hoy que no nos vemos
Ni tú, ni el mar, ni el cielo
Ni quien me trajo a ti

Si pudiera volver a nacer
Te vería cada día amanecer
Sonriendo como cada vez
Como aquella vez

Te voy a escribir la canción más bonita del mundo
Voy a capturar nuestra historia tan solo un segundo
Un día verás que este loco de poco se olvida
Por mucho que pasen los años de largo en su vida

Y te voy a escribir la canción más bonita del mundo
Y voy a capturar nuestra historia tan solo un segundo
Y un día verás que este loco de poco se olvida
Por mucho que pasen los años
Por mucho que pasen los años de largo en tu vida

LYRICS CUÍDATE:

Detrás del tiempo me instalé
Ya ves, ni me quejo ni me quejaré
Mi ser, mis recuerdos y alguna canción
Son hoy mi premio de consolación

Y tú, ¿qué has hecho para olvidar?
¿Qué fue de aquella chica del bar?
Lo sé, prohibido preguntar
Muy bien, seré sincera

Cubrí mis ojos con mis manos y luego imaginé
Que estabas ahí de pie disimulando por mí

Cierra la puerta, ven y siéntate cerca
Que tus ojos me cuentan que te han visto llorar
Llena dos copas de recuerdos de historias
Que tus manos aún tiemblan si me escuchan hablar

Sin ti, ya no podré escuchar
A la buena vida más
Volver a reírme de aquel final
En el que el bueno acaba mal

Sin ti, ya no regresaré
Al lugar donde te conocí
Lo sé, prohibido recordar
Muy bien, seré sincera

Cubrí mis ojos con mis manos y luego imaginé
Que estabas ahí de pie disimulando por mí

Cierra la puerta, ven y siéntate cerca
Que tus ojos me cuentan que te han visto llorar
Llena dos copas de recuerdos de historias
Que tus manos aún tiemblan si me escuchan hablar

Tú cuídate
Aquí yo estaré bien
Olvídame, yo te recordaré

Cierra la puerta, ven y siéntate cerca
Que tus ojos me cuentan que te han visto llorar
Llena dos copas de recuerdos de historias
Que tus manos aún tiemblan si me escuchan hablar

Cierra la puerta, ven y siéntate cerca
Que tus ojos me cuentan que te han visto llorar
Y llena dos copas
Y vamos a bailar tú y yo

Letras:

Un cafÃ© con sal. ganas de llorar.
mi mundo empezando a temblar,
presiento que se acerca el final.
no quiero ganar. ahora eso quÃ© mÃ¡s da.
estoy cansada ya de inventar excusas que no saben andar.
y sÃ³lo quedarÃ¡n los buenos momentos de ayer que fueron de los dos.
y hoy sÃ³lo quiero creer ...
Que recordarÃ¡s las tardes de invierno por madrid,
las noches enteras sin dormir.
la vida pasaba y yo sentÃ­a que me iba a morir de amor
al verte esperando en mi portal sentado en el suelo sin pensar
que puedes contar conmigo.
Nunca hubo maldad. sÃ³lo ingenuidad.
pretendiendo hacernos creer que el mundo estaba a nuestros pies.
cuando el sueÃ±o venga a por mÃ­ en silencio voy a construir
unavida a todo color donde vivamos juntos los dos.""",True,True,76924294.0,pop music

LYRICS PARÍS:

Ven, acércate
Ven y abrázame
Vuelve a sonreír, a recordar París,
a ser mi angustia
Déjame pasar una tarde más

Dime dónde has ido,
dónde esperas en silencio, amigo
Quiero estar contigo y regalarte mi cariño,
darte un beso y ver tus ojos
disfrutando con los míos hasta siempre
Adiós, mi corazón

Ven, te quiero hablar
Vuelve a caminar
Vamos a jugar al juego en el que yo era tu princesa
Ven, hazlo por mí
Vuelve siempre a mí


Dime dónde has ido,
dónde esperas en silencio, amigo
Quiero estar contigo y regalarte mi cariño,
darte un beso y ver tus ojos
disfrutando con los míos hasta siempre
Adiós, mi corazón

No hay un lugar que me haga olvidar
el tiempo que pasé andando por tus calles junto a ti
Ven, quiero saber por qué te fuiste sin mí
Siempre tuve algo que contarte

Dime dónde has ido,
dónde esperas en silencio, amigo
Quiero estar contigo y regalarte mi cariño,
darte un beso y ver tus ojos
disfrutando con los míos hasta siempre
Adiós, mi corazón


No hay nada que me haga olvidar
El tiempo que ha pasado ya, no volverá
No hay nada más
Adiós, mi corazón

“We shot ‘What’s Going On' in Detroit and Flint Michigan, we wanted a place that resonates with the song and the history of Motown, while also remaining relevant to the sociopolitical issues in the music video.
 
The music video took four days to shoot, but I travelled to Michigan a couple weeks early to find the right people. It was very important for us to find real people that resonated with the stories, rather than casting actors. We wanted the history of the song and the communities we filmed in to come through in our video. For example, Steve Smith, who plays the blind man in our music video, actually worked for Motown when ‘What’s Going On’ was originally recorded. The church we filmed in was one of the first establishments to set up a water station for the Flint community - they would hand out clean water and raise awareness on the ongoing crisis within the community.
 
In addition to Steve Smith, we had the opportunity to feature other influential community figures in our music video, including Karen Weaver, the mayor of Flint, and pivotal activists that have been involved in the Flint Water Crisis for many years. One such activist in our music video is named Ariana Hawk, who, along with her young son, was featured on the cover of Time Magazine during the height of the water crisis. She ended up moving from Flint, only to return in order to continue the fight for her community. To this day, the Flint Water Crisis has yet to be resolved, and Ariana continues to be a strong activist in the movement.
 
""The point is that this is a historic song for an important moment in history, and what’s beautiful is that it’s message is timeless and universal. It’s about human emotions, human relationships, and a coming together. My hope is that our music video will remind people to continue asking the question Marvin Gaye asked in 1971.” - Director: Savanah Leaf

Lyrics
I feel so unsure
As I take your hand
And lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
Was what I did so wrong
So wrong that you had to leave me alone?",True,True,701891360.0,pop music

Lyrics

Well I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you

But I've got to think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too

Oh but I
Need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh when that love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showing you the door

‘Cause I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith
‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith

Baby,
I know you're asking me to stay
Say please, please, please don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues
Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh oh baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

Yes I've gotta have faith…
Mmm, I gotta have faith
‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith-a-faith-a-faith

Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh oh baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

Cause I gotta have faith
Mmm I gotta have faith

Lyrics

I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

It's much to late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of fife
But you misread my meaning when i met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although i search myself, it's always someone else i see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me""",True,True,,pop music

Lyrics

(Gotta get up to get down)
(Gotta get up to get down)
(Ooh ooh, baby baby)

Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Well baby can't you read the signs?

I won't bore you with the details baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby, I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fastlove
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
Some fastlove is all that I've got on my mind

(Ooh ooh, baby baby)
Ooh, yeah yeah
(Ooh ooh, baby baby)
What's there to think about baby?
(Ooh ooh, baby baby)
Hey baby, oh yeah
(Ooh ooh, baby baby)

Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
But I just wanna have some fun

I won't bore you with the details baby
Gotta get there in your own sweet time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby, I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fastlove
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
Some fastlove is all that I've got on my mind
Get yourself some lessons in love

So close
I can taste it now baby
So close

In the absence of security
Made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
But I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby, oh yeah
I miss my baby, tonight
So why don't we make a little room
In my BMW babe
Searchin' for some peace of mind
Hey, I'll help you find it
I do believe that we are practicing the same religion

Oh you really oughta get up now
That's right
Oh you really oughta get up
(Ooh ooh, baby baby)
Oh yeah

Lyrics

Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights
Consumed by shadows
I was crippled emotionally

Somehow I made it through the heartache
Yes I did. I escaped.
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (I know you did), kept my faith

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting.
I knew you were waiting for me

With an endless desire
I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
Like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over,
One touch and you set me free

No, I don't regret a single moment,
No, I don't (I know you don't) looking back
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (I know you do), I just laugh

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting.
I knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny (oh, boy)
I know this love we shared was meant to be

I knew you were waiting,
Knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting,
Knew you were waiting for me

I didn't falter
I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting.
I knew you were waiting for me

I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting.
I knew you were waiting for me",True,True,98857291.0,pop music

Lyrics

That's all I wanted:
Something special, something sacred
In your eyes.
For just one moment
To be bold and naked
At your side.

Sometimes I think that you never
Understand me (understand me).
Maybe this time is forever.
Say it can be, whoa.

That's all you wanted:
Something special, someone sacred
In your life.
Just for one moment
To be warm and naked
At my side.

Sometimes I think that you never
Understand me (understand me).
But something tells me together
We'd be happy, oh, oh.

(baby)
I will be your father figure.
(oh, baby)
Put your tiny hand in mine.
(I'd love to)
I will be your preacher teacher.
(be your daddy)
Anything you have in mind.
(it would make me)
I will be your father figure.
(very happy)
I have had enough of crime.
(please let me)
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time (of time).

That's all I wanted,
But sometimes love can be mistaken
For a crime.
That's all I wanted:
Just to see my baby's
Blue eyes shine.

This time I think that my lover
Understands me (understands me).
Please
If we have faith in each other
Then we can be
Strong.

(baby)
I will be your father figure.
Put your tiny hand in mine.
(my baby)
I will be your preacher teacher.
Anything you have in mind.
I will be your father figure.
I have had enough of crime.
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time.

If you are the desert
I'll be the sea.
If you ever hunger 
Hunger for me.
Whatever you ask for
That's what I'll be.

So when you remember the ones who have lied,
Who said that they cared,
But then laughed as you cried,
Beautiful darling,
Don't think of me.

Because all I ever wanted...
It's in your eyes, baby, baby.
And love can't lie.
No.

Greet me with the eyes of a child.
My love is always tellin' me so.
Heaven is a kiss and a smile.
Just hold on, hold on.
And I won't let you go, my baby.

I will be your father figure.
Put your tiny hand in mine.
I will be your preacher teacher.
Anything you have in mind, baby.
I will be your father figure.
And I have had enough of crime.
I will be the one who loves you—
So, I am gonna love you—
'Til the end of time.

I will be your father.
(I will be your...)
I will be your preacher.
(...father)
I will be your father.
I'll be your daddy, whoa.
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time.",True,True,114364994.0,pop music

Lyrics
Kindness in your eyes
I guess you heard me cry
You smiled at me
Like jesus to a child
I'm blessed i know
Heaven sent and heaven stole
You smiled at me like
Jesus to a child
And what have i learned
From all this pain
I thought i'd never feel the same
About anyone or anything again
But now i know

When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight",True,True,65416428.0,pop music

Lyrics
As Around The Sun The Earth Know She's Revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assured that
I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older everyday
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

As today I know I'm living but tomorrow
Could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
I know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
Cause I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
For now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
Cause I'll he loving you always.

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
A party we will throw
A party we will throw now

[Verse 1: The Game]
All I need is the chronic to keep me fit
A bad bitch, a project apartment and 2 pits
Red chucks, a red bic to keep my kush lit
Thank god for what I get but never really needed shit
I'm a hustler nigga, that's how I got this red Bentley
Slay the competition and told them that Dre sent me
Walk through the smoke like what up loc
Cause one always got that bomb dot com that make me choke
We gonna twist up 8 for Nate blow the smoke through the clouds
In hopes that it reaches the pearly gates
Now, how many niggas wanna throw up a dub
And be surrounded by the baddest bitches up in the club yeah
It's the math blood, sixes on the ave cuz
Phantom got your girl pussy wetter than my bath tub
Fuck her all night, wake her up at 6
Lil mama grab your shit, get ghost

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
A party we will throw
A party we will throw now

[Verse 2: Warren G]
Click clack what up, zig zag run up
Nic nac paddie whack, twisting up a fat sack
Tic tac toe up, I be in them streets like an intersection
I got connection, from every section
Critical, political, it's killer Cal'
Roll it up, now pass that shit around
My mental is cynical, original
Thinking you could see us
I'm like nigga how?
I'm in that diamond lane, I'm in that diamond chain
Glissing and glowing, I'm sipping liquor I'm blowing zippers my nigga I'm on one
I'm pushing the zone up, I'm sitting up, my pistol shining my chrome up
My nigga Game got the gun load
One shot mix a nigga brain like some gumbo, uh, oh
All that tough talk nigga, what for?
Shut your scary ass up at the front door

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
A party we will throw
A party we will throw now

[Warren G]
Couldn't nobody diss my nigga, damn I miss my nigga
Pour out a little liquor, big Nate Dogg nigga 213
From the city by the sea, where them G's ride
Turn around baby let me listen to the b-side
Slap that, tap that, after that, east side
As I travel this road I see the street sign
Ready for whatever, Beretta's you know I keep mine

[The Game]
It's the L-B, C-P-T nigga we be, OG to BG, that's where the weed be
Killer (what?) Cali-forni-a, eh
Load the strap, hop into the six trey Snoop, what up loc
I'm headed to the east side, G ride throwing up everything but the peace sign
Gold Daytonas, gangbang persona nigga trip, I'ma pop the top off his Corolla

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road

Eazy Lyrics:

[Chorus: The Game & Michel'le]
(He was once a thug from around the way)
My life was never (Eazy)
My life was never (Eazy)

[Verse 1: The Game]
Started in my Cutlass clutchin' heat like it's an open oven
Puffin' chronic, Puff and Biggie out the window, speaker subbin'
Run into the Crips, it ain't no discussion
Bullet wounds drenched in Hennessy and teaspoons of Robitussin
Head up faze, got a few concussion, yeah
Compton's amazed, Dr. Dre percussion
God, please grant my nigga eternal life, we need the beats
Aftermath wherе you fall asleep, you do not eat
And my belly is full, gorilla ridin' the bull
Banana clips in thе pool, swan dive in Clase Azul
The opps, I'm on they ass, grandmama whoopings in school
This Wilmington and Brazil where niggas die in they jewels
Too many Problems, too many YGs
So many ties to dollar signs, easy to end up on E
I got shot up like Columbine, the Crips descended on me
Sign my name on the dotted line, that was vengeance on beats
This is the way

[Chorus: The Game & Michel'le]
(He was once a thug from around the way)
My life was never (Eazy)
My life was never (Eazy)

Lyrics:
Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me

I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene

And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene

I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you each step of the way
And I will always love you
I will always love you
Bitter-sweet memories
That's all I am taking with me
Good-bye, please don't cry
We both know that I'm not
What you need
I will always love you
I will always love you

I hope life, treats you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
And I wish you joy
And happiness
But above all of this
I wish you love
And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you

Lyrics:

Every time I tried to make it on my own
Every time I tried to stand and start to fall
All those lonely roads that I have travelled on
There was Jesus
When the life I built came crashing to the ground
When the friends I had were nowhere to be found
I couldn't see it then but I can see it now
There was Jesus

IN THE WAITING AND THE SEARCHING
IN THE HEALING AND THE HURTING
LIKE A BLESSING BURIED IN THE BROKEN PIECES
EVERY MINUTE EVERY MOMENT
OF WHERE I BEEN AND WHERE I'M GOIN
EVEN WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW IT
OR COULDN'T SEE IT
THERE WAS JESUS

For this man who needs amazing kind of grace
For forgiveness at a price I could not pay
I’m not perfect so I thank God every day that
There was Jesus

IN THE WAITING AND THE SEARCHING
IN THE HEALING AND THE HURTING
LIKE A BLESSING BURIED IN THE BROKEN PIECES
EVERY MINUTE EVERY MOMENT
OF WHERE I BEEN AND WHERE I'M GOIN
EVEN WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW IT
OR COULDN'T SEE IT
THERE WAS JESUS

On the mountain in the valleys (There was Jesus)
In the shadows of the alleys (There was Jesus)
In the fire in the flood (There was Jesus)
Always is and always was
