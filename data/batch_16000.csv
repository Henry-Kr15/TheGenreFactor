It's made of 4 different films, two of which are by Abel Ferrara ('Ms. 45' and 'The Blackout' and two by Andrei Tarkovsky ('Solaris' and 'The Mirror'), both incredible visual directors. I just did the editing (cut all the scenes and assembled them in a way to create a story) and own nothing here, all the rights belong to their respective owners.

Thanks to the amazing band Cigarettes After Sex for an incredible debut album and the song.

Lyrics:

Give me the pistol, aim it high
I’m out in the desert shooting at the sky
Guess I really miss you & I don’t know what else to do

Beautiful pictures that you took of us
Used to hang up there on your bedroom walls,
But you took them all down now & you put them into a drawer

You’ve been on my mind,
You’ve been on my mind,
You’ve been on my mind so long I can’t deal with it

You’ve been on my mind
& I’ll waste my time until you lift me off the floor & love me again

I know if I saw you & we kissed just once
You could be happy, maybe you’d come back
Because I really miss you, don’t know how much more I can take…",True,True,22511340.0,Indie

Lyrics:

Wanting your love to come into me
Feeling it slow, over this dream
Touch me with a kiss, touch me with a kiss

Now you’re above feeling it still
Tell me it’s love, tell me it’s real
Touch me with a kiss, feel me on your lips

Because this is where I want to be
Where it’s so sweet & heavenly

I’m giving you all my love

Needing you now to come into me
Feeling it slow, over this dream
Touch me with a kiss, feel me on your lips

When you’re above feeling it still
Tell me it’s love, tell me it’s real
Touch me with a kiss, touch me with a kiss...

& when you’re far away I still feel it all
& when you’re far away I still feel it all the same...",True,True,137438524.0,Indie

LYRICS
Verse 1
You say I ain’t shit but you love that shit
Your friends send me pics that’s when you got pissed
But if she ain’t a 10 I ain’t touching it
I know why you bitching I’m a dog with it
You know all my coupe's got no roof roof 
You do it with no hands, call ya bluetooth 
Me and you was gang, you my thug misses 
The ting you got on, got em all singing 

Hook
Aye you girl in the tight up skirt 
Way that you move make my heart start to hurt
Aye you girl in the tight up shorts
You speed up ten more beats to my heart
Aye you girl in the jeans
How you fit them tings
Do you hear me calling you x3

Verse 2 (Rema) 
Oou Baby girl no one like you 
E be the reason many men want you 
If the matter worse I fit die for you 
But if I die e mean say I con lose 

Me no fit dey this life solo
Many girls don do me wayo
now e be only you I know 
Na only your number dey my phone 


Hook
Aye you girl in the tight up skirt 
Way that you move make my heart start to hurt
Aye you girl in the tight up shorts
You speed up ten more beats to my heart
Aye you girl in the jeans
How you fit them tings
Do you hear me calling you x3

Bridge
Girly I don’t mean to be rude
Girly when they put me in the mood oh baby
Yeah the way they tight up me screw
Ohhh na
And even you drive me crazy
Baby I don’t mean to be rude
Make a rude boy go crazy, crazy
Ima be a fool for you, right now
Maybe maybe

Hook
Aye you girl in the tight up skirt 
Way that you move make my heart start to hurt
Aye you girl in the tight up shorts
You speed up ten more beats to my heart
Aye you girl in the jeans
How you fit them tings
Do you hear me calling you x3

Verse 1
You say I ain’t shit but you love that shit
Your friends send me pics that’s when you got pissed
But if she ain’t a 10 I ain’t touching it
I know why you bitching I’m a dog with it
You know all my coupe's got no roof roof 
You do it with no hands, call ya bluetooth 
Me and you was gang, you my thug misses 
The ting you got on, got em all singing 

Hook
Aye you girl in the tight up skirt 
Way that you move make my heart start to hurt
Aye you girl in the tight up shorts
You speed up ten more beats to my heart
Aye you girl in the jeans
How you fit them tings
Do you hear me calling you x3

Verse 2 (Rema) 
Oou Baby girl no one like you 
E be the reason many men want you 
If the matter worse I fit die for you 
But if I die e mean say I con lose 

Me no fit dey this life solo
Many girls don do me wayo

Na only your number dey my phone 


Hook
Aye you girl in the tight up skirt

Aye you girl in the tight up shorts
You speed up ten more beats to my heart
Aye you girl in the jeans

Way that you move make my heart start to hurt
Aye you girl in the tight up shorts
You speed up ten more beats to my heart
Aye you girl in the jeans
How you fit them tings

We can take a jet or layup in my high rise
Keep it real with you It ain’t nothing to lie ‘bout
Don’t be asking don’t be pressing about my whereabouts
Don’t be listening to them bitches what they say about me
Keep it solid you’re gonna ride til’ the wheels out
All she ever wanted was a real hood n****
She don’t see no flaws only see the good in  ́em
I was just a dog fucking with the wrong bitches
Tell me when I’m lost ‘cause you see the bigger picture
Said she never met a nigga none like me
Give her six figures just to shop Like me
Walk like me now she talk like meG63 bought a new double C

[CHORUS – REMA]

Lyrics:
Sad girls!
Sad girl, promise you’ll be okay
 
Money on my mind, guess we fantasise 
Levels to the remedy stuck in my mind 
Told my mumma shit I promise we gon be alright 
Still I keep you awake at night 
Yeah 
Get it in, only way I’m getting out 
At least I make my brother proud 
I be riding round they tryna find me now 
I’m feeling happy I ain’t always down yeah
 
I know she feeling me 
Not a dealer b 
I’m the realist g 
I know 
LSD’s how I feel the breeze 
I got the sad girls feeling like I’m ecstasy 
I got this one girl telling me that I’m the one 
Came close like the bullet when I jammed my gun 
Got more time when I feel the drums 
Got the bass in my mind when I’m feeling numb
  
Told my lil darling we gon fly up to the sky 
I be drinking till the feeling in my head goes down 
yeah I’m walking on clouds is it real? 
I be tripping widda baddie while I spin around 
Guess I like her but this girl a Gemini 
And she 
And she really got me turnt right now 
Are you feeling the vibe is it real?
I can’t hear you when the music it be up so loud
  
Promise you’ll be okay
I be drinking till the feeling in my head
Sad girl,
Promise you’ll be okay
  
There’s something I see about this girl, Different from the first time I saw her 
For a moment she looked like a loner 
When she move on the dance floor 
She got that vibe she got that essence 
Wey nobody else fit belong 
I can tell she a sad girl outside 
But inside she be young 
Oh party’s over she crying outside 
I ask her what’s wrong 
She said leave me alone 
I don’t want your love 
Kiss me and just go 
I think she’s happy she’s a sad girl.
 
Told my lil darling we gon fly up to the sky 
I be drinking til the feeling in my head goes down 
yeah I’m walking on clouds is it real? 
I be tripping widda baddie while I spin around 
Guess I like her but this girl a Gemini 
And she 
And she really got me turnt right now 
Are you feeling the vibe is it real?
I can’t hear you when the music it be up so loud
 
Promise you’ll be okay
I be drinking till the feeling in my head
Sad girl,
Promise you’ll be okay
 
And I feel like I’m floating through the sky 
Baby tell me if you feel what I feel
I’m imagining us smoking feeling high
Got this Cali in my pack for the chill
She told me come and slide into this paradise 
I got feelings in my body and they never lie 
All this liquor in my cup’s got me feeling right
I don’t care about my issues when I’m feeling live yeah

Lyrics 
---------
Heartbeat is coming in so strong
If you don’t stop I’m gonna need a second one
Oh, there’s something I’ve been meaning to say to you baby (hold that thought)
Yeah, there’s something I’ve been meaning to say to you baby
but I just can’t do it
What a call, moving in
I feel like I can loosen my lips
(come on so strong)
I can summarise it for you
It’s simple and it goes like this..
I’m in love with you
She’s got her broadsheet, reading down the list of the going wrong
s
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m getting no sleep. Tossing and turning all night long
Oh, there’s somewhere I’ve been meaning to take the conversation (hold that thought)
Yeah, there’s somewhere I’ve been meaning to take the conversation, but I just can't do it
You show me your black girl thing, pretending that I know what it is (I wasn’t listening)
I apologise, you meet my eyes
Yeah it’s simple and it goes like this..
I’m in love with you
Yeah I got it!
I found it!
I've just gotta keep it
‘Don’t fuck it, y
ou muppet!!’
It’s not that deep
I’ve been counting my blessings
Thinking this through just
like ‘1, 2.. yeah I’m in love with you!!’
I’m in love with you

Lyrics:
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

Music video by Halsey performing Walls Could Talk (Vevo Presents). 2017

On Thursday, June 1, at the MacArthur in L.A., Halsey gave the first full performance of the songs from her new album ‘hopeless fountain kingdom’ at our Vevo Presents show. A fearless stage performer, she brought all the roiling emotions of her latest work to the foreground; both artist and audience connected deeply. Several of the tunes were inspired by a “prolonged breakup” Halsey went through (as well as being artistically influenced by Baz Luhrmann’s ‘Romeo + Juliet’) and their dramatic impact was front and center. “‘BADLANDS was about my relationship with myself,” she says. “‘hopeless fountain kingdom’ is about me fighting to get back to that relationship with myself.”

Lyrics - 
Looking right, looking like
All the stars are fated 
I remember the night 
I was so frustrated 
 
I touch your hand for the time
I see it on your face then
Another lifetime’s flashing by
I’m here standing in, the same dress
You’re in your apartment, I’m already gone
 
When you left I bet you held her body closer
I was hoping you would tell her that it’s over 
You’re all I think about and everywhere I look
I know it’s bad, but we could be so good… 
 
Couple years flashing by
and I’m doing okay. 
In the back of my mind, all i hear is your name
I bet you’re happy and that’s fine 
But I regret just one thing, I never got to change your mind…. 
 
I’m here standing in, the same dress
You’re in your apartment, I’m already gone
Talking wildly out of context I wish things were different
But I’ll never know..
When you left I bet you held her body closer
I was hoping you would tell her that it’s over 
You’re all I think about and everywhere I look
I know it’s bad, but we could be so good… 
 
Maria calls me and she says she’s getting married
She asked me if there’s any extra weight I carry
And do I think about the one that got away, 
I know his name, I think about him everyday….
 
When you left I thought you held her body closer
I never knew that you would tell her that it’s over 
Cause I’m all you think about and everywhere you look
I know it’s bad, but we could be so good…

Lyrics:
Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go nowhere fast
Let’s enjoy right here, where we at

Who knows where this road is supposed to lead
We got nothin’ but time
As long as you right here next time
Everything’s gonna be alright

If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby just let it be
If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby just let it be

So won't you ride with me, ride with me
See where this thing goes
If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby if it’s meant to be

I don’t need to be so uptight
But my heart’s been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn’t treat me right
I ain’t gonna lie, I ain’t gonna lie

‘Cause I’m tired of the fake love
Show me what you’re made of
Boy, make me believe

Whoa hold up, girl, don’t you know you’re beautiful
And it’s easy to see

If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby just let it be
If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby just let it be

So won't you ride with me, ride with me
See where this thing goes
If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby if it’s meant to be

So come on ride with me, ride with me,
See where this thing goes
So come on ride with me, ride with me,
Maybe if it’s meant to be

Maybe we do, maybe we don’t
Maybe we will, maybe we won’t

But if it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby just let it be
If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby just let it be

So won't you ride with me, ride with me
See where this thing goes
If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby if it’s meant to be

If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby if it’s meant to be
If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be

Lyrics:
You said, ""Hey, whatcha doing for the rest of your life?""
And I said, ""I don't even know what I'm doing tonight""
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, ""I never regretted the day that I called you mine""
So I call you mine

Lyrics:
Everything's been so messed up here lately
Pretty sure he don't wanna be my baby
Oh, he don't love me, he don't love me
He don't love me, he don't love me, but that's okay
'Cause I love me, yeah, I love me
Yeah, I love me, yeah, I love myself anyway, hey

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be a good, good life
That's what my therapists say
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be just fine
It's gonna be a good, good life

I'm a mess, I'm a loser
I'm a hater, I'm a user
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new
I'm obsessed, I'm embarrassed
I don't trust no one around us
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new

Nobody shows up unless I'm paying
Have a drink on me, cheers to the failing
Oh, he don't love me, he don't love me
He don't love me, he don't love me, but that's okay
'Cause I love me, yeah, I love me
Yeah, I love me, yeah, I love myself anyway, hey

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be a good, good life
That's what my therapists say
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be just fine
It's gonna be a good, good life

I'm a mess, I'm a loser
I'm a hater, I'm a user
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new
I'm obsessed, I'm embarrassed
I don't trust no one around us
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new

Everything's gonna be alright, alright
Everything's gonna be just fine, just fine
It's gonna be a good, good life

I'm a mess, I'm a loser
I'm a hater, I'm a user
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new
I'm obsessed (I'm obsessed), I'm embarrassed
I don't trust no one around us
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new (yeah)

LYRICS

Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home, someone take me
Look, I didn't power through the struggle
Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions
All these miles, feets, inches
They can't add up to the distance
That I have been through, just to get to
A place where even if there's no closure, I'm still safe
I still ache from trying to keep pace
Somebody give me a sign, I'm starting to lose faith
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair?
I'm trying to find
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home(It's been a long time coming)
Someone take me
Hooooome, ho-o-o-o-me
Hooome, hooome
Someone take me
Hooooome, ho-o-o-o-me
Hoooome, hooome
Look, I been through so much pain
And it's hard to maintain, any smile on my face
'Cause there's madness on my brain
So I gotta make it back, but my home ain't on the map
Gotta follow what I'm feeling to discover where it's at
I need the (memory)
In case this fate is forever
Just to be sure these last days are better
And if I have any (enemies)
To give me the strength to look the
Devil in the face and make it home safe
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair?
I'm trying to find
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
Someone take me
Hoooome, ho-o-o-o-me
Take me home
Hoooome, hooome (take me home)
Someone take me
Hoooome, ho-o-o-o-me (someone, someone)
Nothing here feels like home(Hoooome, hooome)
(Take me home)
Someone take me
Hoooome, ho-o-o-o-me (someone, someone)
Nothing here feels like home(Hoooome, hooome)
(Take me home)
Someone take me

Lyrics:
I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now
Oh, and you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
Finally it's just you and me till we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go",True,True,2229658373.0,soul music

►Lyrics
I’m packing my bags that I didn’t unpack the last time
I’m saying see you again so many times it’s becoming my tag line
But you know the truth
I’d rather hold you then try to catch this flight
So many things I’d rather say but for now it’s goodbye

You, say I’m always leaving
You, when you’re sleeping alone
But the car’s outside but I don’t wanna go tonight

I’m not getting in the Addison Lee
Unless you pack your bags, you’re coming with me
I’m tired of loving from afar
And never being where you are
Close the windows lock the doors
Don’t wanna leave you anymore

I’m staring at the same four walls in a different hotel
It’s an unfamiliar feeling but I know it so well
Oh but you know the truth, I’d rather hold you then this mobile in my hands
But I guess it will do because for you I would run up my phone bill

You, say I’m always leaving
You, when you need me the most but
The car’s outside but I don’t wanna go tonight

I’m not getting in the Addison Lee
Unless you pack your bags, you’re coming with me
I’m tired of loving from afar
And never being where you are
Close the windows lock the doors
Don’t wanna leave you anymore

Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh
Don’t wanna leave you anymore

Oh darling all of the city lights
Never shine as bright as your eyes
I would trade them all for a minute more
But the car’s outside and he’s called me twice
But he’s gonna have to wait tonight

Cos I’m not getting in the Addison Lee
Unless you pack your bags, you’re coming with me
I’m tired of loving from afar
And never being where you are
Close the windows lock the doors
Don’t wanna leave you anymore

(Ad libs)
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh
I don’t wanna leave you anymore

Oh oh, oh oh
I don’t wanna leave you
I don’t wanna leave you
I don’t wanna leave you
Don’t wanna leave you anymore

Lyrics:
You walked into the room and now my heart has been stolen
You took me back in time to when I was unbroken
Now you're all I want
And I knew it from the very first moment
'Cause a light came on when I heard that song and I want you to sing it again

I swear that every word you sing, you wrote them for me
Like it was a private show, but I know you never saw me
When the lights come on and I'm on my own
Will you be there to sing it again?
Could I be the one you talk about in all your stories
Can I be him?

I heard there was somone but I know he don't deserve you
If you were mine I'd never let anyone hurt you, no, no
I wanna dry those tears, kiss those lips
It's all that I've been thinking about
'Cause a light came on when I heard that song and I want you to sing it again

I swear that every word you sing, you wrote them for me
Like it was a private show, but I know you never saw me
When the lights come on and I'm on my own
Will you be there to sing it again
Could I be the one you talk about in all your stories?

Can I be the one
Can I be the one
Can I be the one
Oh, can I, can I be him?

Won't you sing it again?
Oh, when you sing it again
Can I be him?
Oh, sing it again, yeah
Oh, when you sing it again
Can I be him?

I swear that every word you sing, you wrote them for me
Like it was a private show, but I know you never saw me
When the lights come on and I'm on my own
Will you be there, will you be there?
Can I be the one you talk about in all your stories
Can I be him
Can I be him
Can I be him
Can I be him?

Lyrics

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot, I did

And now
When all is done, there is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
And thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know
I know and now

When all is done, there is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
Oh what I hoped would be impossible
Impossible (Impossible)
Impossible (Impossible)
(Impossible)

Impossible
(Impossible) 
Impossible
(Impossible)

Lyrics:

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
You know you want me
So don’t keep saying our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you’re my destiny?

What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours
Tonight

You think it's easy
You think I don't want to run to you, yeah
But there are mountains (There are mountains)
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you’re wondering why
Because we’re able to be
Just you and me
Within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

No one can rewrite the stars (Rewrite the stars)
How can you say you’ll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
(The one you were meant to find)
It's not up to you, it's not up to me, yeah
When everyone tells us what we can be (Tells us what we can)
And how can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours tonight (Be ours)

All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It’s not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible

And how do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
And nothing can keep us apart
'Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one could say what we get to be
And why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changing the world to be ours

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break and my hands are tied

About Anne-Marie:
Anne-Marie has proved to be one of the UK’s most exciting and successful British breakthrough popstars of recent years. A former 3x world karate champion and West End child star-turned 9x BRIT Award nominee, A-M’s rise has been nothing short of meteoric. In 2018 Anne-Marie released her debut album, ‘Speak Your Mind’ which featured the hit singles 'Alarm', 'Ciao Adios', 'Heavy', 'Friends', '2002' and 'Perfect to Me'. She subsequently ended that year as as the UK’s biggest-selling debut artist, selling out headline shows and playing stadium dates supporting long-time friend and champion Ed Sheeran in the process.

She has also sang on and co-written many other hits such as Birthday, Rockabye, Don't Leave Me Alone,  To Be Young, f*ck, i'm lonely and Don't Play, collaborating with the likes of Clean Bandit, Marshmello, David Guetta, Lauv, Rudimental, Doja Cat and KSI, as well as starring on The Greatest Showman: Reimagined soundtrack performing Rewrite the stars alongside James Arthur.

In an epic follow-up from his hugely successful international #1 ‘Where Are You Now’, Lost Frequencies now returns with his next smash ‘Questions’ featuring world-class vocalist James Arthur, with an exclusive visual video.

Hot off the press and already named ‘Trending song’ on the UK Chart show on Hits Radio, support from peers in the industry was instant from names including Sam Feldt and Tiesto, with fans across social media branding the track as “the sound of the summer” and “smash of the season”. 

Speaking on the release Lost Frequencies said: “After a massive collab with Calum Scott on ‘Where Are You Now’, I felt like I was in a nice place for my next move! I’ve been working on tons of music the last few months, but when ‘Questions’ came along and I started to work with James Arthur on the vocal, I knew this was going to be the next single! Production-wise, I liked the idea to follow the flow of my previous single, but with a big chord progression before the chorus to give a good feeling in the track, before falling back in a more melancholic mood! Can’t wait to play this one at my live shows and I hope you all love the visuals we have come up with for ‘Questions’!”

Linking up with Lost Frequencies once more with his visceral vision, director Brett de Vos stated: “The video is about someone reflecting on their past relationship, but instead of only remembering the ‘good stuff,’ it also looks at other possible perspectives on what happened and where it ‘went wrong’. This track provides an amazing opportunity to play with memory and perspective and the video becomes a beautiful, visceral and surreal journey through moments that feel sometimes raw and real and at other times quite surreal. Although we play with elements and themes of nostalgia, loss and breaking, the video feels overarchingly positive and optimistic - a sentiment that is currently resonating with so many: especially those living & wanting to live their ‘best lives’. This is a powerful insight & I am excited to share it with so many in such an accessible, beautiful and crazy way.”.

With a stunning beach and sunset environment to set the scene, mirrored images creating a signature look with Lost Frequencies live instrumentation and laid-back vibe, the emotive and bonding visuals take the viewer on a journey of cinematic bliss.",False,True,51981244.0,pop music

i’ll be the first witness

you have my heartbeat, beating loud
and i'm waiting for you love
to feel your heartbeat
and i am aching to hold you now
 
when you take your first steps
i’ll need to be there
thought i belonged to the road
but you made the house feel like home
you are my lighthouse
peeking out from the dark clouds
i lived under my whole life
i thank god your alive
 
and there is nothing i won’t do for you
 
darling you're my blood
you have my heartbeat
you have my heartbeat, beating loud
and i'm waiting for you love
to feel your heartbeat
and i am aching to hold you now
 
i will be your shoulder
when you're feeling pain
i will try to make it all better
i will be your father
i will be your friend
i will be here for you forever

Lyrics:

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry but I guess you know now
Baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing slow down
Baby
We took a trip now we on your block and it’s like a ghost town
Baby 
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doing all this and all that
Tired of beefing of bums you can’t even pay me enough me to react 

Been waking up in the crib and sometimes I don’t even know where I’m at
Please don’t play that niggas songs in this party I can’t even listen to that
Anytime that I run into somebody it must be a victory lap eh 
Shawty come sit on my lap eh
They saying Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store this isn’t a close able gap
I’ve seen some niggas attack
And don’t end up making it back

I know that they at the crib going crazy down bad what they had didn’t last Damn baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry but I guess you know now
baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing slow down
Baby
We took a trip now we on your block and it’s like a ghost town
Baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doing all this and all that 

I’m in the trenches relax
Can you not play that lil boy in the club cause we do not listen to rats
We in the line I buy her a wig she tellin me Tay is the best
Point at that nigga who act like a killer
But you only want from the neck
I’m like the baby I’m not just a rapper you play with me you gon get stressed
Ooooh
Bring Drake to the hood
Surround Drake around Drakes
Even though I got a case
Imma do what it takes

And I never been embraced
And the moneys hard to make
So I bet they on they face right

I know that they at the crib going crazy down bad what they had didn’t last Damn baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry but I guess you know now
baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing slow down
Baby
We took a trip now we on your block and it’s like a ghost town
Baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doing all this and all that 

When he tell the story that’s not how it went
Know they be lying 100 percent 
Move out the Ritz forgot bout the Bent
Valet just called to tell me come get it
I knocked that boy off  I don’t want no credit
If it Was me they wouldn’t regret it
left me for dead and now they want dead it
heart is still beating
My niggas still eating
The backyard it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with Me she spilling the tea and then shawty came back and said she didn’t mean it
Its hard to believe it

I know that they at the crib going crazy down bad what they had didn’t last Damn baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry but I guess you know now
baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing slow down
Baby
We took a trip now we on your block and it’s like a ghost town
Baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doing all this and all that

Lyrics 

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring

And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up

Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken, one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words they always win, but I know I'll lose

And I'd sing a song, that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up

Oh oh
I wanna sing a song, that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up oh oh, oh

Lyrics 

Take my mind and take my pain
Like an empty bottle takes the rain

And heal, heal, heal, heal

And take my past and take my sins
Like an empty sail takes the wind

And heal, heal, heal, heal

And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last

Take my heart and take my hand
Like an ocean takes the dirty sands
And heal, heal, hell heal

Take my mind and take my pain
Like an empty bottle takes the rain
And heal, heal, heal heal

And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last

Lyrics:
I think today is the best day of my life
Gonna rent a bicycle and ride
around the city, around the city from 9 til 5.

I think today is the best day of my life
Fuk thinking about the future all the time
If I’m alone, if I’m alone then I dont mind

Movie stars in black and white pictures,
Warm beer and valium mixtures
Am in a dream?
Crazy as it seems..

I think today is the best day of my life
Saw a billboard, it said something like
Everything, everything is gonna be alright.

I think today is the best day of my life,
My girlfriend looked worried and asked me ‘Why?’,
But I dunno, I dunno so I didn’t reply..

Laying on the car,
You’ve got stars,
I’ve got scars,
They don’t see..

I think today is the best day of my life,
Last night all I wanted to do was die,
But right now im just happy to be alive...

I’m gonna love you till the day I die
When you cut me you cut me like a knife
I wanna tell you but I’m terrified

Oh what a perfect day
Why do you have to go away
Now the sky’s so grey

Be okay

I’m gonna be okay
Am I gonna be okay

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring

And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love

Lyrics:
And I’m coming home
London in the rain
Driving kinda slow in the fast lane,
Feel kinda stressed,
Trying to get drunk
Problem with the rich kids
is that they’re no fun.

Right now I’m flying :)
So come on take a shot at me
Not scared of dying
It’s sad how sad this life can be..

Driving through the clouds
Picking all the bad ones out the crowd,
Had a bad month,
Had a bad year,
Had a bad time getting over my fears,

Right now im flying :)
So come on take a shot at me
Not scared of dying
Its sad how,

I don’t wanna talk about my problems,
I don’t wanna tell another lie,
I don’t wanna write another love song,
I don’t wanna even fucking try,

Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody

Right now I’m flying :)
So come on take a shot at me
Not scared of dying
It’s sad how sad this life can be

Lyrics
 
You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
Darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small
But I see your true colours
Shining through
I see your true colours
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colours
True colours
Beautiful
Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy
Can't remember when
I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there
And I'll see your true colours
Shining through
I see your true colours
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colours
True colours are beautiful

And I didn't feel your love until I lost

I guess that's love,

Can be cleansed. 
And my arms are tough, 
But they can be bent,

And I wanna fight,

And our souls they blend. 
Yeah love I hope you know,

Lyrics:
The party’s nearly over
We’re sat there on a sofa 
Kinda close, getting closer, 
I know that you gotta go but, 

I don’t wanna say goodbye 
It’s been so long since I
Stayed up late at night 
With someone that I like..

I'm gonna be smiling all the way back home 
I'm gonna be smiling all the way back home 
I'm gonna be smiling all the way, smiling all the way.
Smiling all the way back home 

On the street now, we’re stalling 
The Uber driver keeps calling,
You say to me, ‘just ignore him’ 
4.45am in the morning 

I don’t wanna say goodbye 
Been so long since I
Stayed up late at night 
With someone that I like..

I'm gonna be smiling all the way back home 
I'm gonna be smiling all the way back home 
I'm gonna be smiling all the way, smiling all the way.
Smiling all the way back home 

I don’t wanna say goodbye 
Been so long since I
Stayed up late at night 
With someone that I like..

I'm gonna be smiling all the way back home 
I'm gonna be smiling all the way back home 
I'm gonna be smiling all the way, smiling all the way.
Smiling all the way back home

Lyrics: 
My God, I'm so lonely
So I open the window
To hear sounds of people
To hear sounds of people

Venus, planet of love
Was destroyed by global warming
Did its people want too much, too?
Did its people want too much?

And I don't want your pity
I just want somebody near me
Guess I'm a coward
I just want to feel alright

And I know no one will save me
I just need someone to kiss
Give me one good honest kiss
And I'll be alright

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody, nobody

I've been big and small
And big and small
And big and small again
And still nobody wants me
Still nobody wants me

And I know no one will save me
I'm just asking for a kiss
Give me one good movie kiss
And I'll be alright

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody (nobody)
(Nobody, nobody)

Nobody, nobody

Lyrics:
I steal a few breaths from the world for a minute
And then I'll be nothing forever
And all of my memories
And all of the things I have seen will be gone
With my eyes, with my body, with me
 
But me and my husband
We are doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together
 
And I'm the idiot with the painted face
In the corner, taking up space
But when he walks in, I am loved, I am loved
 
Me and my husband
We are doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We are doing better

This installment of our AEA Sessions video series features New York-based singer-songwriter, Mitski, as she performs three songs from her 2016 album, ‘Puberty 2’. 

Alone with her guitar and washed in a warm, orange glow, Mitski delivers dynamic performances that explore a range of texture and tone. In ‘My Body Is Made Of Crushed Little Stars’, she sings of youthful restlessness while her guitar roars with energy and ferocity. In contrast, her words of somber sympathy in ‘I Bet On Losing Dogs’ ring most true atop her delicate finger-picked guitar playing.

In these sessions, Mitski’s voice and guitar come together to create singular, evocative moments that linger in the mind. To best capture these moments, we rely on the simple, but effective combination of the near-field N22 and far-field, stereo R88.

Both Mitski’s vocal and guitar cab are recorded by the near-field NUVO N22, while the stereo R88 records the room.

Lyrics: 
I'm beautiful, I know cause it's the season
But what am I to do with all this beauty?
Biology, I am an organism, I'm chemical
That's all, that is all

I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall, capture me

Or at least take my picture
Kuzurete yuku maeni
I'm pulsing, my blood is red and unafraid of living
Beginning to end

I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall

How I feel this river rushing through my veins
With nowhere else to go, it circles 'round

I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall, capture me

Lyrics:
You're growing tired of me
You love me so hard and I still can't sleep
You're growing tired of me
And all the things I don't talk about

Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch

It's just that I fell in love with a war
Nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around every night
Just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go

Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch

There's a hole that you fill
You fill, you fill

But it's just that I fell in love with a war
And nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around every night
Just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go
Just to watch it glow

I hold one card
That I can't use
But I want you

You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over
And I love you, darling
And I am done, dear

You're in the house
And I am here in the car
I just need a quiet place
Where I can scream
How I love you

I found you
I found the door
But when I stepped through
There was no floor

You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over
And I love you, darling
And I am done, dear

And I am here in the car

Lyrics: 
Oh, one, two
Honey, what'd you take?
 
I think my brain is rotting in places
I think my heart is ready to die
I think my body is falling in pieces
I think my blood is passing me by

Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me, what you took? What'd you take?
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me, what you took? What'd you take?

I think my fate is losing its patience
I think the ground is pulling me down
I think my life is losing momentum
I think my ways are wearing me down

But if I gave up on being pretty, I wouldn't know how to be alive
I should move to a brand new city, And teach myself how to die

Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me, what you took? What'd you take?
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me, what you took? What'd you take?
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me

Lyrics
Woah, woah
So far, so good
Mhmm, mhm, mhm, yep
 
Why? You only say you love me when you're high 
It's like we go through the same shit every night 
Oh why, oh why?
You always swear that it’s gonna change, but it never does 
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high 
It's like we go through the same shit every night 
Oh why, oh why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does
 
Tell me that you're gonna change
Then act like this instead
I'm too old to want somebody who's always switching up their friends 
I can’t make you love me but at least you could pretend 
Scripts gonna leads to fifths until I'm fucked out of my head 
You play the same old songs I know that you’re different in your Air Force Ones 
Filling my prescription I could bite your tongue 
Like I got an addiction yeah 
You always say this shit’s gonna change, but it never does
 
Why? You only say you love me when you're high 
It's like we go through the same shit every night 
Oh why, oh why?
You always swear that it’s gonna change, but it never does 
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high 
It's like we go through the same shit every night 
Oh why, oh why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does
 
I know it’s my fault I pick up your phone call 
When it’s half past one and you’re halfway drunk 
You say you love me and it sounds so dumb 
But you're the only one I can run away from the same old songs 
I know that you’re different in your Air Force Ones 
Filling my prescription I could bite your tongue 
Like I got an addiction yeah 
You always say this shit’s gonna change, but it never does
 
Why? You only say you love me when you're high 
It's like we go through the same shit every night 
Oh why, oh why?
You always swear that it’s gonna change, but it never does 
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high 
It's like we go through the same shit every night 
Oh why, oh why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does

Lyrics:
You said, ""Hey, whatcha doing for the rest of your life?""
And I said, ""I don't even know what I'm doing tonight""
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, ""I never regretted the day that I called you mine""
So I call you mine

Lyrics:

VERSE:
I'll tell you a story 
Before it tells itself 
I'll lay out all my reasons
You'll say that I need help

We all have expectations 
And sometimes they go wrong
No one listens to me 
So I put it in this song

CHORUS:
They tell me think with my head
Not that thing in my chest 
Got their hands at my neck this time

But you're the one that I want
If that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

VERSE:
Ill tell them a story
They'll sit and nod their heads
If tell you my secrets
will you go tell your friends 

Hold on to your opinions
Stand by what you said
In the end it's my decision
So it's my fault when it ends

CHORUS:
They tell me think with my head
Not that thing in my chest 
Got their hands at my neck this time

But you're the one that I want
If that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

You ain't gotta make it easy, where you been sleepin'?
This shit is keepin' me up at night, just admit it

Love me till the day I die
Surrender my everything

LYRICS:

Some days you’re the only thing I know 
Only thing that’s burning when the nights grow cold
Can’t look away, can’t look away, beg you to stay 

Sometimes you’re a stranger in my bed 
Don’t know if you love me or you want me dead 
Push me away, push me away, then beg me to stay 

Call me in the morning to apologize 
Every little lie gives me butterflies 
Something in the way you’re looking through my eyes 
Don't know if I’m gonna make it out alive

Fight so dirty but your love so sweet 
Talk so pretty but your heart got teeth 
Late night devil put your hands on me 
And never never never ever let go 

Fight so dirty but your love so sweet 
Talk so pretty but your heart got teeth 
Late night devil put your hands on me 
And never never never ever let go 

Some days you're the best thing in my life 
Sometimes when I look at you I see my wife
Then you turn into somebody I don’t know
And you push me away, push me away

Call me in the morning to apologize 
Every little lie gives me butterflies 
Something in the way you’re looking through my eyes 
Don’t know if I’m gonna make it out alive

Fight so dirty but your love so sweet 
Talk so pretty but your heart got teeth 
Late night devil put your hands on me 
And never never never ever let go 

Fight so dirty but your love so sweet 
Talk so pretty but your heart got teeth 
Late night devil put your hands on me 
And never never never ever let go 

Blood on my shirt, a rose in my hand
You’re looking at me like you don’t know who I am 
Blood on my shirt, heart in my hands 
Still beating

Fight so dirty but your love so sweet 
Talk so pretty but your heart got teeth 
Late night devil put your hands on me 
And never never never ever let go 

Fight so dirty but your love so sweet 
Talk so pretty but your heart got teeth 
Late night devil put your hands on me 
And never never never ever let go

BUT YOUR HEAVEN AINT THE SAME
AND I’VE NEVER BEEN A SAINT, HAVE I

BUT I’M NEVER ONE TO CHANGE, AM I

CALL IT A LESSON WHEN I FEEL YOU SLIDE AWAY
AND I’M MISSING OUT ON HALF MY LIFE

OH, YOU MAKE ME COMPLETE
YOU MAKE ME COMPLETE
YOU MAKE ME A COMPLETE MESS

OH, YOU MAKE ME COMPLETE
YOU MAKE ME COMPLETE
YOU MAKE ME A COMPLETE MESS

HANG ON TO MOMENTS LIKE THEY’LL NEVER DRIFT AWAY
CAUSE YOU’LL NEVER GET TO SAY GOODBYE

I ASK NO QUESTIONS AS YOUR COLOURS TAKE THEIR HOLD
AS MY DARKNESS TURNS TO GOLD INSIDE

I LEARNED MY LESSON WHEN I FELT YOU SLIP AWAY
AND I’M MISSING OUT ON HALF MY LIFE

OH, YOU MAKE ME COMPLETE
YOU MAKE ME COMPLETE

OH, YOU MAKE ME COMPLETE

I saw you looking brand new overnight
And I caught you looking too, but you didn't look twice
You look happy, oh, mmm
You look happy, oh

Flashing back to New York City
Chang your flight so you stay with me
Remember thinking that I got this right

And now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I'm cleaning up your mess
I know he's taking off your dress
And I know that you don’t, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me

It's 3 AM and the moonlight's testing me (Ah)
I know that you've been holding on to someone else
And now I can't sleep (Ah)
I ain't happy, oh
I ain't too happy, oh

Flashing back to New York City
I was done, but you undid me
Classic me to run when it feels right

Now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While he's taking off my dress
I know she's laying on your chest
I know that you don't, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me
Singing, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie, lie (Yeah yeah)
I know that you don't, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me

Lyrics:
So this is where I am
Hanging on a feeling
Driving through the valley just to chase the pain again
 
So this is where we are
I should’ve seen it coming
Every time we say goodbye
I say hello again
 
I cried in your dark brown eyes for the thousandth time
‘Cause you love somebody
I died when you left that night
For the thousandth time
‘Cause you love somebody
 
Else i tried to stop the door as it was closing
It was closing
Can’t help the way I keep ignoring every omen
Every omen
 
Heaven knows I should let go
It’s nothing that I don’t already know
 
I kiss you on your neck
You were staring at the ceiling
I should’ve known right then and there you were a runaway
 
 
Oh just make it go away
Can you help me rearrange it?
I’m still making sense of having nothing left to save
 
I cried in your dark brown eyes for the thousandth time
‘Cause you love somebody
I died when you left that night
For the thousandth time
‘Cause you love somebody
 
Else i tried to stop the door as it was closing
It was closing
Can’t help the way I keep ignoring every omen
Every omen
 
Heaven knows I should let go
It’s nothing that I don’t already know
 
We go ‘round again
We jump back in bed
That’s what you do when you love somebody
These bad omens
I look right through them
That’s what you do when you love somebody
 
We go ‘round again
We jump back in bed
That’s what you do when you love somebody
These bad omens I look right through them
That’s what you do when you love somebody
 
When you love somebody
When you love somebody

LYRICS:

Is it easier to stay is it easier to go I don't wanna know oh but I know that I'm never ever gonna change and you know you don't want it any other way

Why do we always gotta run away
When we wind up in the same place
It's like we're looking for the same thing, same thing, yeah

Do we really gotta do this now
Right here with all your friends around 
In the morning we can work it out, work it out

I love you so much that I hate you right now
It's so hard to blame you cause you're so damn beautiful
So damn beautiful

Is it easier to stay is it easier to go I don't wanna know oh but I know that I'm never ever gonna change and you know that you're always gonna stay the same

Is it easier to stay is it easier to go I don't wanna know oh but I know that I'm never ever gonna change and you know you don't want it any other way

Every time that you say you're gonna leave
That's when you get the very best of me
You know we need it like the air we breathe, air we breathe, yeah

I love you so much that I hate you right now
it's so hard to blame you cause you're so damn beautiful

So damn beautiful

Is it easier to stay is it easier to go I don't wanna know oh but I know that I'm never ever gonna change and you know that you're always gonna stay the same

Is it easier to stay is it easier to go I don't wanna know oh but I know that I'm never ever gonna change and you know you don't want it any other way

And the hardest part of all is that we're only built to fall

Is it easier to stay is it easier to go I don't wanna know oh but I know that I'm never ever gonna change and you know that you're always gonna stay the same

Is it easier to stay is it easier to go I don't wanna know oh but I know that I'm never ever gonna change and you know you don't want it any other way

I love you so much that I hate you right now
It's so hard to blame you cause you're so damn beautiful

Heat Waves Lyrics

road shimmer
wiggling the vision
heat heat waves
i’m swimming in a mirror

sometimes, all i think about is you
late nights in the middle of june
heat waves been faking me out
can’t make you happier now

usually i put
something on tv
so we never think
about you and me

but today i see
our reflections 
clearly in hollywood
laying on the screen

you just need a better life than this
you need something I can never give
fake water all across the road
it’s gone now the night has come but

you can’t fight it
you can’t breathe
you say something so loving but
now  I’ve got to let you go
you’ll be better off in someone new
i don’t wanna be alone
you know it hurts me too

you look so broken when you cry
one more and then i’ll say goodbye

i just wonder what you’re dreaming of
when you sleep and smile so comfortable
i just wish that I could give you that
that look that’s perfectly unsad

sometimes, all i think about is you
late nights in the middle of june
heat waves been faking me out
heat waves been faking me out

Song Lyrics:

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

 Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

 Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

 You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

 Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

 I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

 Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

 Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror

Glass Animals - Gooey (Official Video)

Lyrics
Alright, come close
Let me show you everything I know
A jungle slang
Spinning round my head and I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky, gooey womb
A woozy youth
Dopes up on her silky, smooth perfume

Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

Truth be told
I've been there, I've done this all before
I take your gloom
I curl it up and puff it into plumes

Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

Hold my hand and float back to the summer time
Tangled in the willows, now our tongues are tied
How can I believe you, how can I be nice?
Tripping round tree stumps in your summer smile

Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

Glass Animals - Youth (Official Video)

Lyrics

Boy, when I left you you were young
I was gone, but not my love
You were clearly meant for more
Than a life lost in the war

I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit dappy

Fly
Feel your mother right at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right

Boy, now your life is back-to-front
But you'll see that's not for long
'Cause I know you'll feel the ghost
Of some memories so warm

Boy, I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit dappy

Fly
Feel your mother right at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right

Boy, I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit dappy

Fly
Feel your mother right at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right
I'll make you...

Boy, I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit...

Oh oh oh

'Heat Waves' Lyrics:
[Intro]
(Last night, all I think about is you
Don't stop, baby, you can walk)

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2 - Iann Dior]
I've been thinking 'bout what life can be
Imagine there was only you and me
Woke up from the longest dream
Baby now you got me on my knees
I've been waiting on you just to get my hopes up
But we can never make it there
I can't help but feeling scared
What's it gonna take for you to finally show up?
Water in my eyes make it hard to see 'cause

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Bridge - Glass Animals and Iann Dior]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Outro]
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror

Glass Animals - I Don't Wanna Talk (I Just Wanna Dance) | Lyrics

Don’t wanna talk baby I just wanna dance 
I don’t wanna talk, no more living in the past baby
Don’t wanna talk baby I just wanna dance 
And I’m not gonna stop till I forget what we had

We kissed in the morning on a summer day 
You taste like cigarettes and hurricanes 
There’s a warning written in the corners of your face 
Whiplash and you left me in a vapour trail 

Now I know it’s safe to say
Nothing’s perfect anyway

You say you fell in love but you don’t know how 
We were good once but I fucked up now 
I was dumb trying to work things out
I built a house and you burned it down 

Don’t wanna talk baby I just wanna dance 
I don’t wanna talk, no more living in the past baby
Don’t wanna talk baby I just wanna dance 
And I’m not gonna stop till I forget what we had

Just a minute now
There’s something different now 
All your morning sounds
How’s it all so loud? 
Put the flowers down 
Cause they look like clouds
Leave me to it then 
And let your hair grow out 

Now I know that it’s safe to say
Nothing’s perfect anyway

Don’t wanna talk baby I just wanna dance 
I don’t wanna talk, no more living in the past baby
Don’t wanna talk baby I just wanna dance 
And I’m not gonna stop till I forget what we had 

You say you fell in love but you don’t know how 
We were good once but I fucked up now 
I was dumb trying to work things out
I built a house and you burned it down 

Don’t wanna talk baby I just wanna dance 
I don’t wanna talk, no more living in the past baby
Don’t wanna talk baby I just wanna dance 
And I’m not gonna stop till I forget what we had baby

Don’t wanna talk baby I just wanna dance 
I don’t wanna talk, no more living in the past baby
Don’t wanna talk baby I just wanna dance 
And I’m not gonna stop till I forget what we had 

You fell in love but you don’t know how 
We were good once but I fucked up now

Glass Animals - Life Itself (Official Video)

Lyrics

Daddy was dumb, said that I’d be something special
Brought me up tough but I was a gentle human
Said that he loved each of my two million freckles
When I grew up was gonna be a superstar

I can't get a job so I live with my mum
I take her money but not quite enough
I sit in the car and I listen to static
She said I look fat but I look fantastic

Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe

I'm waking up, lost in boxes outside Tesco
Look like a bum sipping codeine Coca-Cola
Thought that I was northern Camden's own Flash Gordon
Sonic ray gun, gonna be a superstar

I can't get a job so I live with my mum
I take her money but not quite enough
I make my own fun in grandmama's basement
Said I look mad, she said I look wasted

Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe

Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe

Glass Animals - Pork Soda (Official Video)

Lyrics

Pineapples are in my head
Got nobody 'cause I'm brain-dead
Pineapples are in my head
Got nobody 'cause I'm brain-dead

Somewhere in Southend when you were fun
You took my hand and you made me run
Up past the prison to the seafront
You climbed the cliff edge and took the plunge

Why can’t we laugh now like we did then?
How come I see you and ache instead?
How come you only look pleased in bed?
Let's climb the cliff edge and jump again (Whoo!)

Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)

Somebody said I'm a fuckin' slum
Don’t know where I belong
Maybe you’re fucking dumb
Maybe I’m just a bum
Maybe you’re fucking scum
Don’t you go psycho chum
I want you for the world
I want you all the time (stop)

Pineapples are in my head
(When you were fun)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(You made me run)
Pineapples are in my head
(To the seafront)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(She took the plunge)

Five thousand footsteps in your wet dress
Back to the house with your arms round my neck
We drank pork soda with tangled legs
I won’t forget how you looked at me then
I know I'm no sweet prince of love
Those times that we got drunk
Maybe Jamaica rum
Maybe some Jonnie Dub
Maybe you still think of us
Phone buzz, and still I jump
Why don't I say it then?
I want you all the time

Why can’t we laugh now like we did then?
How come I see you and ache instead?
How come you only look pleased in bed?
Let's climb the cliff edge and jump again

Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)

Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)

LYRICS (Written by, The Lumineers, BMI):

I've been trying to do it right
I've been living a lonely life
I've been sleeping here instead
I've been sleeping in my bed,

I've been sleeping in my bed 

So show me family
all the blood that i will bleed
I dunno where I belong
I dunno where I went wrong,
but I can write a song

I belong with you, you belong with me
you're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
you're my sweet

I don't think you're right for him
think of what it might have been if you
took a bus to Chinatown
I'd be standing on canal
and bowery
and she'd be standing next to me

I belong with you, you belong with me
you're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
you're my sweetheart

And love, we need it now
Let's hope for some
Cause oh, we're bleeding out

I belong with you, you belong with me
you're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
you're my sweet",True,True,936767650.0,alternative rock

Lyrics:
Tired, blue boy walks my way
Holding a girls hand
That basic b*tch leaves finally
Now I can take her man

Someone told me stay away from things that aren't yours
But was he yours, if he wanted me so bad?

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves You don't love her
Stop lying with those words

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words

I can't stand her whining
Where's her binky now?
And loving her seems tiring
So boy, just love me, down, down, down

Someone told me stay away from things that aren't yours
But was he yours, if he wanted me so bad?

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words

Melanie Martinez's creative drive and talents as a visual artist have long distinguished her from other musicians. With her debut album Cry Baby, Melanie introduced the world to her distinctly original vision with hits like “Pity Party”, “Pacify Her”, “Alphabet Boy”, “Carousel” and “Sippy Cup”. Creating unique music videos for each album track, including “Soap/Training Wheels” and “Tag, You're It/Milk and Cookies”, Melanie portrays the traumas and insecurities of the album's titular character over a bed of electro pop, alternative and hip-hop. Her latest triumph K-12, an inspired new album and feature film directed by and starring Melanie, brings together a melting pot of low-key hip-hop, soulful pop and indie-leaning electro with whimsical, surreal visuals and magical realism to stunning results.

✖ Play Date Lyrics 

[Verse 1]
You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away
You tell me to come over, there's some games you want to play
I walk into your house, nobody's home
It's just me and you, you and me alone

[Pre-Chorus]
We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't want to play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you

[Chorus]
I don't give a fu*k about you anyways
Who ever said I give a sh*t about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
Play Date

[Verse 2]
Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say
When I try to talk you're always playing board games
I wish I had monopoly over your mind
I wish I didn't care all the time
Play Date

[Pre-Chorus]
We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't want to play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you

[Chorus]
I don't give a fu*k about you anyways
Who ever said I give a sh*t about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
Play Date

[Bridge]
Ring around the rosy
I never know, I never know what you need
Ring around the rosy, I want to give you, want to give you
What you need

[Chorus]
I don't give a fu*k about you anyways
Who ever said I give a sh*t about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you

[Outro]
You know I give a fu*k about you everyday
Guess it's time that I tell you the truth
If I share my toys, will you let me stay?
Don't want to leave this play date with you
Play Date

---------------------------------------
i see a lot of people coming at me saying i stole her video.
I DID NOT!
the video is already on her channel ""melanie martinez'

i just took the double feature video ( soap and training wheels )
and i splited them bc most of the people want to watch soap without training wheels or training wheels without soap AND some people cant watch those 2 music videos from her channel bc I guess they blocked it from their country or something.

so, i swear to god i dont take money from both of these videos.
i love melanie and i dont mean anything else.

Hey girl, open the walls
Play with your dolls
We'll be a perfect family
When you walk away is when we really play
You don't hear me when I say
""Mom, please wake up
Dad's with a slut
And your son is smoking cannabis
No one ever listens
This wallpaper glistens
Don't let them see what goes down in the kitchen
Places, places
Get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E, I see things that nobody else sees
Hey girl, look at my mom
She's got it going on
Ha, you're blinded by her jewelry
When you turn your back
She pulls out a flask
And forgets his infidelity
Uh oh, she's coming to the attic, plastic
Go back to being plastic
No one ever listens
This wallpaper glistens
One day they'll see what goes down in the kitchen
Places, places
Get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains

Hey girl (Hey girl)
Hey girl, open your walls
Play with your dolls
We'll be a perfect family
Places, places
Get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect

‘Soap’ served as the 2nd Official Single off Melanie Martinez’s Debut Studio Record ‘Cry baby’.

Released on July 10th, 2015, this Promo Visual premiered alongside the Singles release as the filming for the Official Music Video got delayed. Melanie & a few of their friends shot this Visual inside a hotel bathroom on 8mm film. 

She never intended for this to be the “Official Soap Music Video” which is why it’s been removed from her Youtube Channel. Later the same year, Melanie released a ‘Double Feature’ for tracks 6 & 7 (Soap/Training Wheels) off their ‘Cry baby’ LP.

♫ Lyrics ♫ *Soap - Melanie Martinez*

[Intro]
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap

[Verse 1]
Think I just remembered somethin'
I think I left the faucet runnin'
Now my words are fillin' up the tub
Darling, you're just soaking in it
But I know you'll get out the minute
You notice all your fingers prunin' up

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tired of being careful, gentle
Trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh-oh, there it goes
I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?


[First-Chorus]
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God, I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God, I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

[Verse 2]
Think I got myself in trouble
So I'll fill the bath with bubbles
Then I'll put the towels all away
Should've never said the word ""love""
Threw a toaster in the bathtub
I'm sick of all the games I have to play

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tired of being careful, gentle
Trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh-oh, there it goes
I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?


[Chorus]
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God, I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God, I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

[Final-Chorus]
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God, I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash, wash, mouth, mouth with soap
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God, I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

Lyrics
Did my invitations disappear?
Why'd I put my heart on every cursive letter?
Tell me why the hell no one is here
Tell me what to do to make it all feel better
 Maybe it’s a cruel joke on me
Whatever whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me
Forever forever
It's my party and I cry if I want to cry if I want 
To cry cry cry
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I cry if I want to 
cry if I want to (cry cry cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
Maybe if I knew all of them well
I wouldn't have been trapped inside this hell that holds me
Maybe if I casted out a spell or told them decorations were in pastel ribbons
Maybe it's a cruel joke on me
Whatever whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me 
Forever forever 
It's my party and I cry if I want to cry if I want 
To cry cry cry
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I cry if I want to 
cry if I want to (cry cry cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
I'm laughing I'm crying it feels like I'm dying
I'm laughing I'm crying it feels like I'm dying
I’m laughing I'm crying it feels like I'm dying I'm dying I'm dying


The official YouTube channel of Atlantic Records artist Melanie Martinez.


Melanie Martinez's creative drive and talents as a visual artist have long distinguished her from other musicians. With her debut album Cry Baby, Melanie introduced the world to her distinctly original vision with hits like “Pity Party”, “Pacify Her”, “Alphabet Boy”, “Carousel” and “Sippy Cup”. Creating unique music videos for each album track, including “Soap/Training Wheels” and “Tag, You're It/Milk and Cookies”, Melanie portrays the traumas and insecurities of the album's titular character over a bed of electro pop, alternative and hip-hop. Her latest triumph K-12, an inspired new album and feature film directed by and starring Melanie, brings together a melting pot of low-key hip-hop, soulful pop and indie-leaning electro with whimsical, surreal visuals and magical realism to stunning results.

Lyrics:
O-O-Ovy On The Drums
Salud, mami
Ah, ah, ah, ay

Lo que no sirve que no estorbe
Te metiste autogol por torpe
Te quedó grande este torque
Ya no estoy pa' que de mí te enamores, baby (Chi)
Sin Visa ni pasaporte (No)
Mandé tu falso amor de vacaciones (Chi, chi, chi, chi, chi, chi)
Pa' la mierda y nunca vuelvas
Que todo se te devuelva, no
De lo que me hiciste si no te acuerda'

No me vuelvas a llamar, que hasta boté el cеlular
De lo tóxico que erеs, se volvió perjudicial
Lo que se va, se va
Conmigo no te equivoques
De lo tóxico que eres, no te quiero ver más (Chi)

Llegué pa'l party, saca la botella
La que te quería, no sé quién es ella
Te dejé el review, no te puse ni una estrella
Y te olvidé porque no dejaste huella
Ya no miro pa'trás, ni pa' parquearme
Tengo a uno que está listo pa' llevarme
El segundo está esperando en el hotel
Y el tercero lo conozco esta noche (No, no)
No me llames, que mi número cambié (Cambié)
Si quieres que te lo dé (Dé)
Llama 1-800-jódete
No sé si me escuchaste
No me llames, que mi número cambié (Cambié)
Si quieres que te lo dé (Dé)
Llama 1-800-jódete (Jódete)

No me vuelvas a llamar, hasta boté el celular
De lo tóxico que eres, se volvió perjudicial
Lo que se va, se va, ah-ah
Conmigo no te equivoques
De lo tóxico que eres, no te quiero ver más (Ey)

Ay, yo lo lamento (Ah)
Tu' gana' de volver (Ey) murieron en el intento (Ah)
Lo hiciste ver como que perdiste el tiempo
Quedaste bien porque lo mío ni lo cuento (Papi)
Te veo en la' rede', no puedo creerlo, qué pena de ti (Pena de ti)
Yo que fui buena y tú qué gonorrea pagándome así (Nea, qué gonorrea)
Rata de dos patas, lo dijo Paquita
Un animal rastrero (Jaja)
Que se come todo lo que se atraviesa
Diablo, tú ere' un cuero (Cuero)
No digas ""Te quiero,"" mejor sé sincero (Ey)
No digas ""Te amo"" (Ah) porque eso fue en vano (Ah)
Llorando estaba' tú y como no te salí
Andas comiéndote a otra, pero estás pensando en mí (Chi)

No me vuelvas a llamar, hasta boté el celular
De lo tóxico que eres, se volvió perjudicial
Lo que se va, se va, ah-ah
Conmigo no te equivoques
De lo tóxico que eres, no te quiero ver más

Ouh
Repítelo, mami
""Que a veces no te cambian por algo mejor
Y ni siquiera por algo más rico""
KAROL G y Becky G
It's the real G's, baby (Jaja)
Ovy On The Drums

Lyrics:
You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how
Well you're the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror
And singing in the shower
La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da
Singing in the shower
La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da
Singing in the shower

Letra:
Un poquitito, un poquitito te podés emborrachar
Dos copas de vino

Tamo' hablando de voltaje
Hoy estamos sudando todo el maquillaje
Me tenes volando alto sin pasaje
La que esta contigo no quiere que baje

Pero hoy vine con cinco amigas, mira lo que traje
Esto ahora parece nuestra pasarela
Pasa una, pasa' dos, están bien bellas
Si se va la luz, bebe, prendé la vela

Porque hoy no la bajamo', estamo' armando un alboroto
Aquí somo' puro corazones roto'
Lo que diga la gente a mi me importa poco
Esta noche parece que pecamo'

Mañana nos confesamo'
El bebé conmigo se ganó la loto
Me quiero hacer la mala poquito a poco
Esta noche parece que pecamo'

Mañana nos confesamo' (Mañana, mañana)
Mañana nos confesamo' (Mañana, mañana)
Ay, que rico la pasamo' (Mañana)
Y esta noche parece que pescamo' (Anitta)

Hoy yo vengo por lo mío (Mío)
Vuelo directo de Miami para Rio (Rio)
Haciendo que lo baile [?] el cazerío (-río)
Me trae a Tini, vamo' a armar tremendo lio

Deja que le suba y baje, lo único que yo te pido (Pido)
Le gusta darle duro contra la pared (Pared)
Diamante brillando 'e la cabeza a los pies (Pies)
Y el es de los míos, se ganó la loto (Loto)

Porque hoy no le bajamo', estamo' armando un alboroto
Aquí somo' puro corazones roto'
Lo que diga la gente me importa poco
Esta noche parece que pecamo' (Woo, woo)

Mañana nos confesamo' (hey)
El bebé conmigo se ganó la loto (hey)
Me quiero hacer la mala poquito a poco (hey)
Esta noche parece que pecamo'

Mañana nos confesamo' (Mañana, mañana)
Mañana nos confesamo' (Mañana, mañana)
Ay, que rico la pasamo' (Mañana)
Y esta noche parece que pecamo'
 
Estamos activas las nenas de Paris, con un flow safari
El bebe sí contesta cuando llama Becky G
Tenemo' to' el drip, drip, todo de Gucci-cci
Te tengo emboba'o como Lele a Guaynabichy

Vestidito corto, sin nada debajo, eh
Pa' esto es que trabajo
Tenemos el honey, expensive, caro
Estoy con la mía y el resto pa'l carajo

Tú sí, tú sí, tú sí quiere', yo tengo, bebé quiere'
Pa' que va a pedir permiso, si, también, pero se puede
Conmigo bendecido, esto no sale 'e la' parede'
Tú sí, tú sí, tú sí quiere', tú sí, tú sí, tú sí quiere' hoy

Estamo' armando un alboroto
Aquí somo' puro corazones roto'
Lo que diga la gente a mi me importa poco

[Becky G]
Aunque ha pasado el tiempo
Sigo recordando esos días
Me llenabas de flores
Pero en las noches no volvías
 
Seamos amantes
Y cuando estemos juntos ámame como antes
Yo nunca te encontré aunque te busque en otras partes
Perdóname mi amor ya no voy a fallarte
Solo quiero amarte
 
[Becky G]
Seamos amantes
Y cuando estemos juntos ámame como antes
Yo nunca te encontré aunque te busque en otras partes
Perdóname mi amor ya no voy a fallarte
Solo quiero amarte
 
Baby el pasado me dolió
Pero lo nuestro nunca murió
Y aunque pase el tiempo no olvido
Lo que un día tuvimos tú y yo
 
Los primeros besos a escondidas
Esas noches de placer
Vuelve y cúrame las heridas
Y de nuevo enamórame
 
Tu boquita me mata
Cántame flamenco yo te bailo una bachata
Báilame pega, baby que tú me arrebata
Tú me vuelves loca, la mirada me delata
Me haces falta
 
[Daviles de Novelda]
Seamos amantes
Y cuando estemos juntos ámame como antes
Yo nunca te encontré aunque te busque en otras partes
Perdóname mi amor ya no voy a fallarte
Solo quiero amarte
 
[Becky G]
Seamos amantes
Y cuando estemos juntos ámame como antes
Yo nunca te encontré aunque te busque en otras partes
Perdóname mi amor ya no voy a fallarte
Solo quiero amarte
 
[Daviles de Novelda]
Vamos a ser amantes, baby tu quédate
Vamos a darnos besitos donde te bese
Para recordar lo que vivimos ayer
Mamichula yo a ti, te quiero comer
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah tu solo mirame
Yeah, yeah, yeah ven y besame
 
Tu sientes lo mismo que sentíamos de niños
La misma sensación, sintiendo el mismo cariño
Bésame en la boca, que quiero sentirte
Desde que te fuiste, mi alma esta triste
 
[Becky G]
Seamos amantes
Y cuando estemos juntos ámame como antes
Yo nunca te encontré aunque te busque en otras partes
Perdóname mi amor ya no voy a fallarte
Solo quiero amarte

Seamos amantes
Y cuando estemos juntos ámame como antes
Yo nunca te encontré aunque te busque en otras partes
Perdóname bebe ya no voy a fallarte

Baile toda la noche
Pero con quién
Fuimos a varios lugares, la verdad no estaba en mis planes
Si llegue tarde a la casa es porque...

Bailé con mi ex
Y se sintió como la primera vez
Dando vueltas se nos fueron las horas, nos quеdamos a solas
Me alegro ver quе a él también le va bien

Bailé con mi ex
No quiero que vuelva a pasar ota vez
Me lo encontré, bailamos y revivimos 
Cuando nos conocimos
Me alegro ver que a él también le va bien

Bailé con mi ex
Bailé con mi ex
Bailé con mi ex

Tú no me creerás, pensarás que hay algo más
Es difícil de entenderlo, pero no sería capaz de engañarte
Y si te lo cuento
Es porque tengo muy claro lo que siento

Él para mí es un recuerdo
Aunque no me acuerdo
Cómo pasó, ni en qué momento
Fue por cosas del destino que se dio
Nos miramos y sonó nuestra canción

Bailé con mi ex
Y se sintió como la primera vez
Dando vueltas se nos fueron las horas, nos quedamos a solas
Me alegro ver que a él también le va bien

Bailé con mi ex
No quiero que vuelva a pasar ota vez
Me lo encontré, bailamos y revivimos cuando nos conocimos
Me alegro ver que a él también le va bien

Bailé con mi ex
Bailé con mi ex
Bailé con mi ex

Fulanito

Que manera
Como el consigue de mi lo que quiera
Quedé partía desde la primera hacemos lo que no hace cualquiera
Y nos sale tan bien

El es el fulanito
Que me tiene loca a mi 
Bailando apretadito 
Hoy no vamos a dormir
El es el fulanito
Que me tiene loca a mi
Bailando apretadito 
Hasta que nos boten de aquí 

Muevelo que esto aprieta neta
Nos gastamos los chavos que tengo en la tarjeta
Muevelo que aprieta neta 
Me pongo bonita me pongo coqueta 
Solo para ti porque quiero comerte y que todos nos vean 
Solo para ti porque contigo 
Tengo lo que otras desean 
Cuando yo me muevo así 
Se te nota que te gusta 
Y te pone happy 
Cuando muerdes de esta fruta

Cuando yo me muevo así 
Se te nota quete gusta 
Y te pone happy 
Cuando muerdes de esta fruta

El es el fulanito
Que me tiene loca a mi 
Bailando apretadito 
Hoy no vamos a dormir
El es el fulanito
Que me tiene loca a mi 
Bailando apretadito 
Hasta que nos boten de aquí

El esel fulanito
Que me tiene loca a mi 

Bailando apretadito 
Hoy no vamos a dormir
El es el fulanito
Que me tiene loca a mi 
Bailando apretadito 
Hasta que nos boten de aquí

Hasta que nos boten de aquí
Vamos a bailar apretadito

 Lyrics:
 [Produced by Joel Little]
 [Video by Joel Kefali]
 
 [Verse 1]
 I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
 I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
 And I'm not proud of my address
 In a torn up town, no postcode envy
 
 [Pre-Chorus]
 But every song's like
 Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
 Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
 We don't care; we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
 But everybody's like
 Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
 Jet planes, islands, tiger's on a gold leash
 We don't care; we aren't caught up in your love affair
 
 [Chorus]
 And we'll never be royals (Royals)
 It don't run in our blood
 That kind of luxe just ain't for us
 We crave a different kind of buzz
 Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
 You can call me queen bee
 And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
 Let me live that fantasy
 
 
 [Verse 2]
 My friends and I, we've cracked the code
 We count our dollars on the train to the party
 And everyone who knows us knows
 That we're fine with this
 We didn't come from money
 
 [Pre-Chorus]
 But every song's like
 Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
 Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
 We don't care; we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
 But everybody's like
 Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
 Jet planes, islands, tiger's on a gold leash
 We don't care; we aren't caught up in your love affair
 
 [Chorus]
 And we'll never be royals (Royals)
 It don't run in our blood
 That kind of luxe just ain't for us
 We crave a different kind of buzz
 Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
 You can call me queen bee
 And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
 Let me live that fantasy
 
 
 [Bridge]
 (Oh, oh-oh)
 We're bigger than we ever dreamed
 And I'm in love with being queen
 (Oh, oh-oh)
 Life is great without a care
 We aren't caught up in your love affair
 
 [Chorus]
 And we'll never be royals (Royals)
 It don't run in our blood
 That kind of luxe just ain't for us
 We crave a different kind of buzz
 Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
 You can call me queen bee
 And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)

 Lyrics:
 [Intro]
 Wait till you're announced
 We've not yet lost all our graces
 The hounds will stay in chains
 Look upon Your Greatness and She'll send the call out
 Send the call out
 Send the call out
 Send the call out
 Send the call out
 Send the call out
 Send the call out
 Send the call out
 Send the call out
 Send the call out
 Send the call out
 Send the call out
 Send the call out
 Send the call out
 Send the call out
 Send the call out
 
 [Verse 1]
 Call all the ladies out, they're in their finery
 A hundred jewels on throats
 A hundred jewels between teeth
 Now bring my boys in, their skin in craters like the moon
 The moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
 
 
 [Pre-Chorus]
 Dancin' around the lies we tell
 Dancin' around big eyes as well
 Even the comatose, they don't dance and tell
 
 [Chorus]
 We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
 Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
 Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
 And you know we're on each other's team
 
 [Post-Chorus]
 I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
 So there
 
 [Verse 2]
 So all the cups got broke
 Shards beneath our feet
 But it wasn't my fault
 And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
 'Cause what this palace wants is release
 
 [Chorus]
 We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
 Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
 Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
 And you know we're on each other's team
 
 
 [Post-Chorus]
 I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
 So there
 I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care
 So there
 
 [Chorus]
 We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
 Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
 Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
 And you know we're on each other's team
 
 [Outro]
 We're on each other's team
 And you know we're on each other's team
 We're on each other's team

 Lyrics:
 [Intro]
 One, two
 
 [Verse 1]
 Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
 He don't wanna know me
 Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
 Says it was poison
 So I guess I'll go home into the arms of the girl that I love
 The only love I haven't screwed up
 She's so hard to please but she's a forest fire
 I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
 We slow dance in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
 Is one girl swaying alone, stroking her cheek
 
 [Chorus]
 They say, ""You're a little much for me, you're a liability
 You're a little much for me""
 So they pull back, make other plans
 I understand, I'm a liability
 Get you wild, make you leave
 I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone
 
 [Verse 2]
 The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
 'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
 And then they are bored of me
 I know that it's exciting running through the night
 But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
 Better on my own
 
 [Chorus]
 They say, ""You're a little much for me, you're a liability
 You're a little much for me""
 So they pull back, make other plans
 I understand, I'm a liability
 Get you wild, make you leave
 I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

 Lyrics:
 [Verse 1]
 I do my makeup in somebody else's car
 We order different drinks at the same bars
 I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
 She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar
 
 [Refrain]
 Well those great whites, they have big teeth
 Hope they bite you
 Thought you said that you would always be in love
 But you're not in love no more
 Did it frighten you
 How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
 On the light up floor
 
 [Pre-Chorus]
 But I hear sounds in my mind
 Brand new sounds in my mind
 But honey I'll be seein' you wherever I go
 But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
 I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
 
 [Chorus]
 'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
 I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
 Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
 I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
 
 
 [Verse 2]
 Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom
 I whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you
 
 [Refrain]
 Well those rumors, they have big teeth
 Hope they bite you
 Thought you said that you would always be in love
 But you're not in love no more
 Did it frighten you
 How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
 On the light up floor
 
 [Pre-Chorus]
 But I hear sounds in my mind
 Brand new sounds in my mind
 But honey I'll be seein' you wherever I go
 But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
 I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
 
 [Chorus]
 'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
 I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
 Oh, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
 I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
 Yes, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
 I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
 Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
 I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

 The music on Lorde's 'Melodrama' reflects the wealth of emotions the New Zealand native has experienced of late, and they’re rendered with the kind of poise we’ve come to expect from the pop superstar. Her voice, the melodies, the arrangements she’s chosen to help landscape her feelings - this critically-acclaimed second album is particularly fetching because the 20-year-old singer trusts her idiosyncrasies to fuel her eloquence. “Let’s let things come out of the woodwork,” she coos on “Homemade Dynamite.” That’s what makes the six performances of ‘VEVO X Lorde’ so powerful as well. All her best ideas naturally seep to the surface. Filmed at Electric Lady Sound Studios in New York’s West Village, the mid-August session found Lorde moving through key songs from ‘Melodrama,’ providing each with the proper temperament for the occasion. The set list features “The Louvre,” “Sober,” “Writer In The Dark,” “Supercut,” “Homemade Dynamite,” and “Hard Feelings”/ “Loveless” – she chose to spotlight some of the album’s most vivid moments. Whether backed by a small ensemble, playing the piano alone, or singing a cappella with a squad of vocalists and a beatbox, she brings invention and intensity to the performances. The soft addition of strings and brass adds to the show’s intimacy, and the drama that she’s built a rep on is central to every moment. Jack Antonoff of Bleachers, who produced and co-wrote parts of ‘Melodrama,’ arrives on “Writer In The Dark” to support his pal as well.

 Lyrics:
 [Verse 1]
 In my head, I play a supercut of us
 All the magic we gave off
 All the love we had and lost
 And in my head
 The visions never stop
 These ribbons wrap me up
 But when I reach for you
 There's just a supercut
 
 [Pre-Chorus]
 In your car, the radio up
 In your car, the radio up
 We keep trying to talk about us
 I'm someone you maybe might love
 I’ll be your quiet afternoon crush
 Be your violent overnight rush
 Make you crazy over my touch
 
 [Chorus]
 But it's just a supercut of us
 Supercut of us
 Oh it's just a supercut of us
 Supercut of us
 
 [Verse 2]
 So I fall
 Into continents and cars
 All the stages and the stars
 I turn all of it
 To just a supercut
 
 [Refrain]
 'Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)
 When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
 Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
 We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
 
 [Pre-Chorus]
 In your car, the radio up
 In your car, the radio up
 We keep trying to talk about us
 Slow motion, I'm watching our love
 I’ll be your quiet afternoon crush
 Be your violent overnight rush
 Make you crazy over my touch
 
 [Chorus]
 But it's just a supercut of us
 Supercut of us
 Oh it's just a supercut of us
 Supercut of us
 But it's just a supercut of us
 Supercut of us
 Oh it's just a supercut of us
 Supercut of us
 
 [Refrain]
 In my head, I do everything right
 When you call, I'll forgive and not fight
 Are the moments I play in the dark
 And fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
 'Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)
 When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
 Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
 We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
 'Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)
 When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
 Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
 We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
 In my head, I do everything right
 In my head, I do everything right

 Lyrics:
 Every night,
 I live and die
 Feel the party to my bones
 Watch the wasters blow the speakers,
 Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
 It’s just another graceless night
 I hate the headlines and the weather,
 I’m nineteen and I’m on fire
 But when we’re dancing I'm alright
 It’s just another graceless night
 
 Are you lost enough?
 Have another drink, get lost in us
 This is how we get notorious
 Cause I don’t know,
 If they keep telling me where to go
 I’ll blow my brains out to the radio
 
 All of the things we’re taking
 'cause we are young and we’re ashamed
 Send us to perfect places
 All of our heroes fading
 Now I can’t stand to be alone
 Let's go to perfect places
 
 Every night, I live and die
 Meet somebody, take 'em home
 Let’s kiss and then take off our clothes
 It’s just another graceless night
 
 All the nights spent off our faces
 Tryna find these perfect places
 What the fuck are perfect places anyway?",True,True,213539949.0,art pop

 Lyrics:
 [Verse 1: Lorde]
 A couple rebel top gun pilots
 Flyin' with nowhere to be, oh
 Don't know you super well
 But I think that you might be the same as me
 Behave abnormally
 
 [Pre-Chorus: Lorde]
 Let's let things come out of the woodwork
 I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
 Yeah, awesome right?
 So let's let things come out of the woodwork
 I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lines
 Seeing me rollin', showin' someone else love
 Dancin' with our shoes off
 Know I think you're awesome, right?
 
 [Chorus: Lorde]
 Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
 Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
 Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
 Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
 
 [Verse 2: Khalid]
 I wanna feel the light, pushin' our limits
 Unbuckled for the ride, mhmm
 We're way too far from home
 Let's be honest with ourselves
 We're way too high to drive
 So let's take on the night
 If the light is in the air
 Open, finally, we're goin' and we're free
 
 [Chorus: Khalid & Lorde]
 Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
 Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
 Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
 Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
 
 [Verse 3: SZA]
 I checked your girl at the door
 I sent your friend to the store
 It's only me and you, finally us two
 And I don't regret drinkin' this liquor, makin' you listen
 Yeah, I know you don't know me well
 My girl's at the door
 And I left my pretense at home
 And it ain't no goin' back (goin' back)
 
 [Chorus: SZA & Lorde]
 Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
 Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
 Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
 Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
 
 [Verse 4: Post Malone]
 Walk, never fall, but we still run
 So pour up, pour up another one
 I know, I know we on to somethin'
 We got, we got a loaded gun, yeah
 Go and shoot me the look in your eyes
 And you're here, I'm yours, you're mine
 Find each other when we're losin' our minds
 Then we take it all off
 You're a runaway train, yeah
 And you got me so faded
 And I don't wanna chase it, no
 You know I think you're awesome, right?
 
 [Chorus: All]
 Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
 Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
 Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
 Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite, yeah, yeah
 Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
 Blowin' shit up

The music on Lorde's 'Melodrama' reflects the wealth of emotions the New Zealand native has experienced of late, and they’re rendered with the kind of poise we’ve come to expect from the pop superstar. Her voice, the melodies, the arrangements she’s chosen to help landscape her feelings - this critically-acclaimed second album is particularly fetching because the 20-year-old singer trusts her idiosyncrasies to fuel her eloquence. “Let’s let things come out of the woodwork,” she coos on “Homemade Dynamite.” That’s what makes the six performances of ‘Vevo X Lorde’ so powerful as well. All her best ideas naturally seep to the surface. Filmed at Electric Lady Sound Studios in New York’s West Village, the mid-August session found Lorde moving through key songs from ‘Melodrama,’ providing each with the proper temperament for the occasion. The set list features “The Louvre,” “Sober,” “Writer In The Dark,” “Supercut,” “Homemade Dynamite,” and “Hard Feelings”/ “Loveless” – she chose to spotlight some of the album’s most vivid moments. Whether backed by a small ensemble, playing the piano alone, or singing a cappella with a squad of vocalists and a beatbox, she brings invention and intensity to the performances. The soft addition of strings and brass adds to the show’s intimacy, and the drama that she’s built a rep on is central to every moment. Jack Antonoff of Bleachers, who produced and co-wrote parts of ‘Melodrama,’ arrives on “Writer In The Dark” to support his pal as well.

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Break the news—you're walking out
To be a good man for someone else
Sorry I was never good like you
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to exist just for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

[Chorus]
I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

[Verse 2]
I still feel you, now and then
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine
When you see me, will you say I've changed?
I ride the subway, read the signs
I let the seasons change my mind
I love it here since I’ve stopped needing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

[Chorus]
I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe
I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

Becky Hill, David Guetta - Remember (Lyrics)

I’m doing just fine now its over 
I’ve been moving on and living my life 
But occasionally I lose composure 
And I can’t get you out of my mind
 
If I could go 
Back in time
I’d do things differently yeah I wouldn’t think twice
I distract myself
Think of someone else
But every now & then you remind me
 
It’s only when I’m lying in bed on my own
And I wake up and I don’t see your name on my phone
It’s in the moments where I think that I’m better alone
That’s when I remember 
That’s when I remember
 
Every time I walk past your house in the rain
And I tell myself that you were the biggest mistake
And just when I think I’m finally doing ok
That’s when I remember 
That’s when I remember 
 
My friends tell me I shouldn’t listen
To the voices that go round in my head
So I try to delete all the memories 
But you’re really hard to forget
 
I’m missing you
I’m missing you
