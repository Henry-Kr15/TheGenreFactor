And I know eventually we'll be together (Together)

Presenting a new sound (literally—“bossa nova” means “new style” in Portuguese) to North America and the world, the concert at Carnegie Hall also produced the Getz/Gilberto ensemble, which included Antônio Carlos Jobim—when a lineup of Brazilian superstars teamed up with American saxophonist Stan Getz to roll the lilting fusion of Brazilian samba and West Coast “cool jazz”.

Stanley Getz was an American jazz saxophonist. Playing primarily the tenor saxophone, Getz was known as ""The Sound"" because of his warm, lyrical tone, with his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with Woody Herman's big band, Getz is described by critic Scott Yanow as ""one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists"". Getz performed in bebop and cool jazz groups. Influenced by João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim, he popularized bossa nova in the United States.

João Gilberto (born João Gilberto Prado Pereira de Oliveira) was a Brazilian guitarist, singer and composer who was a pioneer of the musical genre of bossa nova in the late 1950s. Around the world, he was often called ""father of bossa nova""; in his native Brazil, he was referred to as ""O Mito"" (""The Legend"").

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_Gilberto

Antônio Carlos Brasileiro de Almeida Jobim, also known as Tom Jobim, was a Brazilian composer, pianist, guitarist, songwriter, arranger and singer. Considered one of the great exponents of Brazilian music, Jobim internationalized bossa nova.

In 1965, the album Getz/Gilberto was the first jazz album to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It also won for Best Jazz Instrumental Album – Individual or Group and for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.

His 1967 album with Frank Sinatra, Francis Albert Sinatra & Antônio Carlos Jobim, was nominated for Album of the Year in 1968.

LYRICS
***To squash my heart***
It's been a year and a half, love
That our home broke apart
My sabiá*, my guitar
And a cruel disappointment
Was all that was left
Was left
To squash my heart
 
It's been a year and a half, love
That our home broke apart
My sabiá*, my guitar
And a cruel disappointment
Was all that was left
Was left
To squash my heart
 
Who knows, maybe it was better this way
Better for you and better for me
Life is a school
Where people have to learn
The science of living without suffering

*sabiá is a common bird in Latin America.

ORIGINAL LYRICS
***Prá machucar meu coração***
Tá fazendo um ano e meio, amor
Que o nosso lar desmoronou
Meu sabiá, meu violão
E uma cruel desilusão
Foi tudo que ficou
Ficou

Tá fazendo um ano e meio, amor
Que o nosso lar desmoronou
Meu sabiá, meu violão
E uma cruel desilusão
Foi tudo que ficou
Ficou
Prá machucar meu coração
 
Quem sabe, não foi bem melhor assim
Melhor prá você e melhor prá mim
O mundo é uma escola
Onde a gente precisa aprender
A ciência de viver prá não sofrer

Lyrics:
It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Catching walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

While we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Lyrics:
Living my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fueling up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord, I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her

I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows, but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waiting on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him
I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him

I saw you yesterday with an old friend
It was the same old same, how have you been?
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey
You reminded me of brighter days
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church
I was off to drink you away
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home

I just called to say I love you
Come back home

Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie

And this is for the questions thatdon't have any answers
The midnight glancers, and the topless dancers
The can of freaks, cars packed with speakers
The G's with the forty's and the chicks with beepers

The northern lights and the Southern Comfort
And it don't even matter if your veins are punctured
All the crackheads, the critics, the cynics
And all my heroes at the methadone clinics

All you bastards at the I.R.S
For the crooked cops and the cluttered desks
For the shots of Jack and the caps of meth
Half pints of love and a fifth of stress

All the hookers that are tricking out in Hollywood
And for my hoods of the world misunderstood
I said it's all good and it's all in fun
Now get in the pit and try to love someone!

Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie (Love someone)
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie (Come on)
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie (Love someone)
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie (Come on)

For the time bombs ticking and the heads they hang
All the gangs gettin' money and the heads they bang - bang
Wild mustangs, the porno flicks
All my homies in the county in cell block six

The grits when there ain't enough eggs to cook
And to D.B. Cooper and the money he took
You can look for answers but that ain't fun
Now get in the pit and try to love someone!

Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie (Come on)
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy

Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie

Love, and for the hate
And for the peace
Waaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrr!

Lyrics:
Cowboy
Cowboy

Well I'm packin' up my game and I'ma head out west
Where real women come equipped with scripts and fake breasts
Find a nest in the Hills, chill like Flynt
Buy an old drop-top find a spot to pimp
And I'ma Kid Rock it up and down ya' block
With a bottle of scotch and watch lots a crotch
Buy a yacht with a flag sayin' ""Chillin' the Most""
Then rock that bitch up and down the coast
Give a toast to the sun, drink with the stars
Get thrown in the mix and tossed outta bars
Sip the Tiajuana, I want to roam
Find Motown, tell them fools to come back home
Start an escort service for all the right reasons
And set up shop at the top of Four Seasons
Kid Rock and I'm the real McCoy
And I'm headed out west sucker because I wanna be a

Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby!
West Coast chillin' with theBoone's wine
I wanna be a Cowboy, baby!
Ridein' at night 'cause I sleep all day!
Cowboy, baby!
I can smell a pig from a mile away

I bet you'll hear my whistle blowin' when my train rolls in
It goes (whistling), like dust in the wind
Stoned pimp, stoned freak, stoned out of my mind
I once was lost but now I'm just blind
Palm trees and weeds, scabbed knees and rice
Get a map to the stars, find Heidi Fleiss
And if the price is right then I'm gonna make my bid boy
And let Cali-for-ni-a know why they call me

Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby!
West Coast chillin' with theBoone's wine
I wanna be a Cowboy, baby!
Ridein' at night 'cause I sleep all day!
Cowboy, baby!
I can smell a pig from a mile away

Yeah!
Kid Rock you can call me Tex
Rollin' Sunset woman with a bottle of Beck's
Seen a slimmy in a 'Vette, rolled down my glass
And said ""Yeah this dick fits right in your ass""
No kiddin', gun slingin', spurs hittin' the floor
Call me hoss, I'm the boss with the sauce and the whores
No remorse for the sheriff, in his eye I ain't right
I'ma paint his town red then paint his wife white
Cause chaosrock like Amedeus
Find West Coast pussy for my Detroit playas
Mack like mayorsball like Lakers
They told us to leave but bet they can't make us
Why they wanna pick on me
Lock me up and snort away my key
I ain't no G, I'm just a regular failure
I ain't straight outta Compton, I'm straight out the trailer
Cuss like a sailor,drink like a mick
My only words of wisdom are justsuck my dick
I'm flickin' my Bic up and down that coast and
Keep on truckin' till I fall in the ocean

Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby!
Spend all my time in Hollywood and Vine
I want to be a Cowboy, baby!
Ride at night 'cause I sleep all day!
Cowboy, baby!
I can smell a pig from a mile away
Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy!

Lyrics:
I've been sittin' here tryin' to find myself
I get behind myself, I need to rewind myself
Lookin' for the payback, listen for the playback
They say that every man bleeds just like me
And I feel like number one, yet I'm last in line
I watch my youngest son and it helps to pass the time
I take too many pills that helps to ease the pain
I made a couple dollar bills, still I feel the same
Everybody knows my name they say it way out loud
A lot of folks fuck with me, it's hard to hang out in crowds
I guess that's the price you pay to be some big shot like I am
Outstretched hands and one night stands, still I can't find love

And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around
And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around

People don't know 'bout the things I say and do
They don't understand about the shit I've been through
It's been so long since I've been home
I've been gone, I've been gone for way too long
Maybe I've forgot all the things I miss
Oh, somehow I know there's more to life than this
I've said it too many times and I still stand firm
You get what you put in and people get what they deserve

Still I ain't seen mine
No, I ain't seen mine
I've been givin', just ain't been gettin'
I've been walkin' that there line
So, I think I'll keep walkin' with my head held high
I keep movin' on and only God knows why
Only God, Only God, Only God knows why
Only God knows why, why, why
Only God knows why

Take me to the river, ey
Won't you take me to the river, hey, hey, yeah

Yep
I've been on the cover of the Rolling Stone
I met the president when I was half stoned
I been so high I've gotten confused
I been beat down, broke and used
Motherfucker
I drank with hank, talked blues with Billy
Rocked with Run sang with shotgun Willy
Went from small time philly to big time Bobby
From 3 day old chili to saki with wosabi

I'm home hey I'm home
You never met a motherfucker quite like me
Not like me, dida dada like me, hey like me

No more bein' poured drink specials at winners
Or being ignored by the think straight sinners
I used to smoke pinners while my moms made dinner
Now I smoke bombs and rock with Lynyrd skynyrd
No beginners here I'm a seasoned vet
Educated on jazz by my man Ahmet Ertegun, my friend
I been the world n back
But I'm Michigan boy can you feel that

And I'm home
You never met a motherfucker quite like me
Not like me, God damn like me, hey hey like me

Never thought I'd go as far in life as this
Never made par and I could give 2 shits
Never wanted sell cars cause my dad was a dick
Never wanted a guitar 'till I heard a lick like this

And from the depths of dixie to my northern spots
You know its time to rock when ole glory drops

I pimp through town with the top laid back
Black hat, fine blonde, cold pabst in my lap
I'll adapt
To any and all situations
Thats why the call me the pimp of the nation
Hey bitch you best believe I live in the woods not your world of greed
Might, a little weed might a little yeah
I'm so proud to be living in the USA

You've never met a motherfucker quite like me
Hey hey like me, da di da da stay like me, hey hey hey like me
You aint ever met and you aint never going meet
You never met a ,never met a ,never never never never met a

Lyrics:
Fast, on a rough road riding
High, through the mountains climbing
Twisting, turning further from my home
Young, like a new moon rising
Fierce, through the rain and lightning
Wandering out into this great unknown
And I don't want no one to cry
But, tell them if I don't survive

I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

Free, like a river raging
Strong as the wind I’m facing
Chasing dreams and racing father time
Deep like the grandest canyon
Wild like an untamed stallion
If you can’t see my heart you must be blind
You can knock me down and watch me bleed
But you can’t keep no chains on me

I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

And I'm not good at long goodbyes
But look down deep into my eyes
I was born free
Calm, facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets
Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waiting patiently for the sun to set
And when it's done, believe that I
Will yell it from that mountain high

I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

I will bow to the shining sea
And celebrate God's grace on thee

Lyrics:
I remember waiting for the school bus
Jenny Clayton was my first crush
And neither one of us had a clue
An old Cheyenne it was my first truck
Rusted, rough and kinda beat up
But when she jumped in it felt brand new
And now these days when I drive through a small town
I turn my stereo up and roll my windows down

’Cause it reminds me of my first kiss
And those days that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend
An old Chevy and a couple friends
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time
Just to love you again

I remember drinking from the same cup
We’d break up just to make up
I remember falling in love with you
Smokin’ cigarettes on the tailgate
Man it seems like it was yesterday
When Main Street felt like Park Avenue

And when I’m driving through any ol’ small town
I turn my stereo up and roll my windows down

’Cause it reminds me of my first kiss
And those times that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend
An old Chevy and a couple friends
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time

When forever felt like it would never come
And we never thought we’d turn 21
So young we thought this could never end
Oh how I wish we could go back again

And now that time has taken over
And we can’t fight this getting older
But somehow baby we made it through
And every time I’m a lookin’ at you

It reminds me of my first kiss
And those days that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend
An old Chevy and a couple friends
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time
Just to love you again
Just to love you again
Just to love you again
Just to love you again
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time

Lyrics:

Well you told me that I was just not the one,
And you left me standing out in the cold
It's been a long time and I'm so much better now
That I'm looking back and seeing it all
And for the first time there's no pain in my life
Though it's a long hard road that I've gone
We had a good thing and it made me a man cause I know
You got me goin', pardon me my feelings are showing
I'm only saying what's on my mind
Well I found you or maybe I found myself
And I think we knew it all of the time
We fit together just like a lock and a key
And we opened up each other's minds
Yeah, I was laughing 'caus there was no room to cry
There was too much growing to do
We had a good time and it ain't over yet 'cause I know
You got me goin', pardon me my feelings are showing
I'm only saying what's on my mind
You came from nowhere and you just jumped in my life,
And I know it never will be the same
You made me love you and now I'm home once again
No, I never want to leave you no more
'Caus I'm attached to the better half of myself
And there's nowhere else that I'd rather be
You filled an empty, you fixed a bad broken heart, and I know

Lyrics:

I'm woven in a fantasy
I can't believe the things I see
The path that I have chosen
Has led me to a wall
And with each passing day
I feel a little more
Like something dear was lost

It rises now before me
A dark and silent barrier between
All I am
And all that I would ever want to be
It's just a travesty
Towering
Marking off the boundaries my spirit
Would erase

To pass beyond is what I seek
I fear that I may be too weak
And those are few
Who've seen it through
To glimpse the other side
The promised land is waiting
Like a maiden
That is soon to be a bride

The moment is a masterpiece
The weight of indecision's in the air
It's standing there
The symbol and the sum of all that's me
It's just a travesty
Towering
Blocking out the light and blinding me
I want to see

Gold and diamonds cast a spell
It's not for me, I know it well
The riches that I seek
Are waiting on the other side
There's more that I can measure
In the treasure of the love that I can find

And though it's always been with me
I must tear down the wall and let it be
All I am
And all that I was ever meant to be
In harmony
Shining true and smiling back
At all who wait to cross
There is no loss",False,False,5098177.0,progressive rock

This is one of my favourite Kansas's songs, Hold On. I put the song lyrics along with some Kansas pictures and also with some random images I thought suited well with the song.

I've got nothing else to say, I just wish you enjoy this beautiful song as I do.

Lyrics:

On a crystal morning I can see the dewdrops falling
Down from a gleaming heaven, I can hear the voices call
When you comin' home now, son, the World is not for you
Tell me what's you point of view
Hey there Mister Madman, wat'cha know that I don't know
Tell me some crazy stories, let me know who runs this show
Glassy-eyed and laughing, he turns and walks away
Tell me what made you that way
Here I am just waiting for a sign
Asking questions, learning all the time
It's always here, it's always there
It's just love, and miracles out of nowhere
Tell me now dear Mother, what's it like to be so old
Children grown and leavin', seems the world is growin' cold
And though your body's ailin' you, your mind is just like new
Tell me where you're goin' to
It's so simple right before your eyes
If you'll look through this disguise
It's always here, it's always there
It's just love and miracles out of nowhere
I sang this song a hundred, maybe a thousand years ago
No one ever listens, I just play and then I go
Off into the sunset like the western heroes do
Tell me what you're gonna do
Here I am, I'm sure to see a sign
All my life I knew that it was mine

Y en el reloj de antaño, como de año en año

Hacemos el balance de lo bueno y malo 
cinco minutos antes de la cuenta atrás. 

Marineros, soldados, solteros, casados,

Entre gritos y pitos los españolitos 
enormes, bajitos, hacemos por una vez 
algo a la vez.

Hacemos el balance de lo bueno y malo 
cinco minutos antes de la cuenta atrás. 

Y aunque para las uvas hay algunos nuevos 
a los que ya no están echaremos de menos. 
Y a ver si espabilamos los que estamos vivos 
y en el año que viene nos reímos. 

Uno, dos, tres y cuatro y empieza otra vez 
que la quinta es la una y la sexta es la dos 
y así el siete es tres. 
Y decimos adiós y pedimos a Dios 
que en el año que viene a ver si en vez de un millón 
pueden ser dos.

Era mi oportunidad:
unos entran, otros van saliendo
y entre el barullo yo me cuelo dentro.

Allí me colé y en tu fiesta me planté,
Coca-Cola para todos y algo de comer.
Mucha niña mona pero ninguna sola.
Luces de colores, lo pasaré bien.

Yo me preguntaba ¿quién me la puede presentar?
Yo me preguntaba ¿qué es lo que le voy a contar?

La vi pasar y me escondí,
con su traje transparente
Iba provocando a la gente.

Ella me vio y se acercó,
el flechazo fue instantáneo
y cayó entre mis brazos.

Allí me colé y en tu fiesta me planté,
Coca-Cola para todos y algo de comer.
Mucha niña mona pero ninguna sola.
Luces de colores, lo pasaré bien.

The Ed Sullivan Show was a television variety program that aired on CBS from 1948-1971. For 23 years it aired every Sunday night and played host to the world's greatest talents. The Ed Sullivan Show is well known for bringing rock n' roll music to the forefront of American culture through acts like Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones. The entertainers each week ranged from comedians like Joan Rivers and Rodney Dangerfield, to Broadway stars Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, to pop singers such as Bobby Darin and Petula Clark. It also frequently featured stars of Motown such as The Supremes, The Temptations, Stevie Wonder and The Jackson 5. The Ed Sullivan Show was one of the only places on American television where such a wide variety of popular culture was showcased and its legacy lives on to this day.

Written by Miracles members Smokey Robinson and Bobby Rogers, the single was The Temptations' first charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking in the Top 20 at number 11. Falsetto Eddie Kendricks sings lead. It was composed by Robinson and Rogers while on the road with The Miracles as part of the Motortown Revue tour. Its plethora of pick-up lines (""You got a smile so bright/you know you coulda been a candle/I'm holding you so tight/You know you coulda been a handle"") began as a light-hearted joke between Robinson and Rogers to pass time on the long bus rides. Realizing they had something they could work with, the Miracles kept the lyrics in mind and prepared the song for the Temptations, who by this time had only one single that had ever made it onto a Billboard chart (1962's ""Dream Come True"" made it to #22 on the R&B singles chart) and six (can you beleive that!!) flopped singles.
It was recorded was on January 8, 1964, only two weeks after founding Temptation Elbridge Bryant had been fired, and Jimmy Ruffin's younger brother David Ruffin had taken Bryant's place. 
The Temptations learned about the success of ""The Way You Do the Things You Do"" after returning home to Detroit, Michigan and hearing nonchalantly from a Motown executive that ""oh, you guys got a hit."" After reading the number 77 (""with a bullet"") listing in Billboard magazine, Otis Williams and David Ruffin immediately began crying with joy.

The Ed Sullivan Show was a television variety program that aired on CBS from 1948-1971. For 23 years it aired every Sunday night and played host to the world's greatest talents. The Ed Sullivan Show is well known for bringing rock n' roll music to the forefront of American culture through acts like Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones. The entertainers each week ranged from comedians like Joan Rivers and Rodney Dangerfield, to Broadway stars Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, to pop singers such as Bobby Darin and Petula Clark. It also frequently featured stars of Motown such as The Supremes, The Temptations, Stevie Wonder and The Jackson 5. The Ed Sullivan Show was one of the only places on American television where such a wide variety of popular culture was showcased and its legacy lives on to this day.

It evolved from an existing band, White Heart. Since 1973 the vocalists for Heart have been sisters Ann Wilson (lead vocals, flute, guitar) (born June 19, 1950) and Nancy Wilson (vocals, guitar, mandolin) (born March 16, 1954). Over Heart's history, it has had three primary lineups.

Heart first found success when its members moved to Canada, in part to avoid the draft, then later in the United States, and ultimately worldwide. Heart rose to fame in the mid-1970s with music influenced by hard rock and heavy metal, as well as folk music. The band's popularity declined in the early 1980s, but they launched a successful comeback in 1985 which continued into the 1990s, releasing numerous hard-rock songs and ballads. Heart disbanded in 1998, then resumed performing in 2002. In the summer of 2019, Heart ended their 2016 acrimonious break-up by launching their ""Love Alive"" tour.
To date, Heart has sold over 35 million records worldwide, including over 22.5 million in album sales in the U.S. They have had top 10 albums on the Billboard 200 in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2010s.

Belgian superstar DJ/Producers Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike have teamed up with trailblazer R3HAB and Italian pioneering electronic artist Prezioso to release their new single 'Shooting Darts.

An original release lined with the production virtues Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike's music has become renowned for, tied in with the inimitable style R3HAB has elevated in recent years and Prezioso's unique flair with his music. A power chord record with a profound expressive energy, 'Shooting Darts’ blends pop music with contemporary electronic music. The track glides across an emotional musical spectrum thanks to an elastic bassline and arresting female topline vocal.

The monolithic brotherly duo Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and ambassadors of the worldwide phenomenon Tomorrowland have taken the world by storm over the past decade. From becoming the first-ever duo to win the World #1 DJ's crown at the prestigious Top 100 DJs Poll in 2015, the twosome continued to stand firm and managed to stay in the top two for seven years, even claiming the World No.1 crown for a second time (in 2019). Clocking up more than 30 million fans on social media, combined with billions of music streams and video views of their live performances and music. The duo continues to climb global charts and work with everyone from Diplo and David Guetta to Paris Hilton and Natti Natasha to Hans Zimmer and Wiz Khalifa. 

Dutch/Moroccan Multi-Platinum DJ and producer Fadil El Ghoul, better known as R3HAB, has been trailblazing his way through dance music for the past decade. From his breakthrough remixes for Rihanna, Drake, Taylor Swift, Calvin Harris, to anthems such as Platinum-certified 'All Around The World (La La La)' and 'Lullaby,' to his collaborations with the likes of Ava Max, Luis Fonsi, Sean Paul, and more, R3HAB has proven to be one of the most forward-thinking artists in the game. His work has collected over 5 billion streams to date, including 1.1B in 2021 alone. R3HAB founded his label CYB3RPVNK in 2016, which has passed 4B streams across platforms since its inception. He is Spotify's Most Discovered Artist, one of Spotify's top 200 most streamed artists, ranked #12 on the prestigious Top 100 DJs Poll, and has earned 55 Gold and Platinum certificates. In addition, R3HAB has embarked on multiple sold-out worldwide tours, performing at the world's top festivals, such as EDC, Ultra Music Festival, Balaton Sound, Coachella, Summer, Sonic Festival and Tomorrowland.

Italian DJ/producer Prezioso, real name Giorgio Prezioso, is a talented turntablist and winner of numerous DJ competitions. Since the 90s, Prezioso has been making waves in the industry both home and abroad at the forefront of dance music. Most known for his multi-awarded single 'Thunder', which has more than 250 million streams combined, Prezioso has also released influential singles such as 'Tell Me Why', 'Let Me Stay' and 'The Riddle'.

Roll me up and smoke me when I die

(huge thank you to @dathrasi for almost all the lyric translations!)

the beach is a good place to pick up girls
because you can really see what you're getting
most beaches are crawling with chicks
and they’re

i've been moving in backward directions
during astral projections
i plaster my ass on the wall for attention
i need faster connections

past is regret
i flash from the gemses
if i didn't care what my friends did
friends that pretend
wanna end
when you get bit
get slick, get quick
wanna smash shit

ends with a sniff or a huff or injection
i can't handle rejection
damn, my reflection
damn, no one gets it
should i be kind and remind that im weak?
so i fall more behind every week
i'm the shine when the guys take a peek
i cry from my eyes to my feet
stairs to the street to the gutters to the seas

when i mutter in my sleep
i say ""mother, never weep""
my brother finds clutters
she shudders when she sees
another motherfucking trap
wonder when she weeps
wonder where she weeps

thunder on my teeth
spit natural disasters
guys on the cat
don't mess with the past tense 
you're testing the masters
so guess what the fact is
my ex was a bachelor

next can they get big checks from the sets
next from the dancers
next from their moms
this hennessy is cursed
someone hexed all the bottles
(someone hexed all the bottles)

swear on my life, i always try 
but in my eye, i can fly 
sigh

better luck next time

Todo empezó en el invierno pasado (que bien)
me enamoré sin querer y sin pensarlo (ya ves)
creí tener la oportunidad de amar y ser feliz
cuando descubrí tanto amor junto a ti.
Todo empezó en el momento indicado (que bien)
Ojos café, un bluejeans medio gastado (recien)
te vi pasar desde mi carro y me arroje detras de ti
¿quieres caminar conmigo si? ...
Y juntos nos fuimos del brazo con la tarde a cuesta
la brisa riendo en tu cara de niña traviesa
y juntos nos fuimos del brazo con la tarde a cuesta
la noche llegó con un beso y miradas inquietas
Y unas copas que se suben poco a poco a la cabeza
y un abrazo cuerpo a cuerpo y en la puerta la inocencia
la inocensia
(nananana)
Todo empezó en el momento indicado (que bien)
Mi corazón ya estaba decepcionado, sin fe
Pero tu amor cambió mi suerte y yo estoy aqui amandote
Y después de amar de amaré aún mas
Y juntos nos fuimos del brazo con la tarde a cuesta
la brisa riendo en tu cara de niña traviesa
y juntos nos fuimos del brazo con la tarde a cuesta
la noche llegó con un beso y miradas inquietas
Y juntos nos fuimos del brazo con la tarde a cuesta
la brisa riendo en tu cara de niña traviesa
Que bien!!!
Todo empezó en el momento indicado (que bien)
sin querer me enamore
y sin pensarlo
Todo empezó en el momento indicado (que bien)
cuando te vi con tu bluejeans
medio gastado me provocastes
Todo empezó en el momento indicado (que bien)
un abrazo cuerpo a cuerpo y en la
puerte la inocensia
Todo empezó en el momento indicado (que bien)
chica junto a ti e descubierto
tanto amor y es para ti
Asi, nos queremos
mucho y mas y mas y mas
Todo empezó...
Todo empezó...
Todo empezó en el momento indicado (que bien)
tu amor cambio mi suerte
y estoy aqui amandote

[Letra]

Yo no te prometí nunca
Te prometí serte fiel pero no, no
Confundas cuando
Dije amar te ame
Yo no te prometí nunca
Te prometí por temor
A fallar de dejar
De cumplir con tu corazón
Y te extrañe lo admito y regrese
Tú me haces falta
Sin ti las noches son
Un fantasma son un castigo
Tú me haces falta
Sí tengo amores que sean contigo
Tú me haces falta
Tú me haces falta
Por eso vuelvo por
El recuerdo de lo vivido
Tú me haces falta
Desde de el momento
En que di contigo
Tú me haces tanta falta amor
(Na, na, na, na)
Yo no te prometí
Nunca te prometí el edén
Pero sí la aventura
De amarte y sentirnos bien
Yo no te prometí
Nunca te prometí eternidad
Pero que sí volvía
Seria amor de verdad
Y te extrañe lo admito y regrese
Tú me haces falta
Sin ti las noches son
Un fantasma son un castigo
Tú me haces falta
Sí tengo amores que sean contigo
Tú me haces falta
Tú me haces falta
Por eso vuelvo por
El recuerdo de lo vivido
Tú me haces falta
Desde de el momento
En que di contigo
Tú me haces falta
Tú me haces falta
Sin ti las noches son
Un fantasma son un castigo
Tú me haces falta
Sí tengo amores que sean contigo
Tú me haces falta
Tú me haces falta
Por eso vuelvo por
El recuerdo de lo vivido
Tú me haces falta
Desde de el momento
En que di contigo
Tú me haces tanta falta amor
(Na, na, na, na)
(Tu me haces falta por
(El recuerdo de lo vivido)
Y esa nostalgia es la
Que me hace mami volver contigo
(Tu me haces falta por
(El recuerdo de lo vivido)
Porque me haces falta regrese
Y esta vez por tiempo indefinido
(Te dije que regresaba, te quiero chica)
(Tu me haces falta por
(El recuerdo de lo vivido)
Es que sin ti las noches
Son un fantasma sí, son un castigo
En mi pensamiento siempre estas tu
Solo tú, solo tú pues por eso vuelvo
Si, tú me haces falta sí tengo
Amores que sea contigo
Tú me haces tanta falta amor

Letra:

No sé si a ti te pasa lo que a mí 
Mi cuerpo está repleto de tus huellas
Que hoy quiero completar
Porque otra vez te irás
Dejándome un puñado de tus besos

Te has ido, así, que triste estoy sin ti
Me acerco a la ventana del recuerdo y no es fácil olvidar
Cuando se sabe amar
Si vives para darte sin reservas

Yo te di todas las noches de mi amor
Y viví para acercarme más ti sin saber
Que la distancia alguna vez hace bien
Hoy yo sé que si regresas otra vez yo
Estaré tan convencido de tu amor, yo lo sé
Que aunque te alejes tú tendrás que volver cada vez otra vez

Te has ido así, que triste estoy sin ti
Me acerco a la ventana del recuerdo y no es fácil olvidar
Cuando se sabe amar
Si vives para darte sin reservas

Yo te di todas las noches de mi amor
Y viví para acercarme más ti sin saber
Que la distancia alguna vez hace bien
Hoy yo sé que si regresas otra vez yo
Estaré tan convencido de tu amor, yo lo sé
Que aunque te alejes tú tendrás que volver cada vez otra vez
Tú tendrás que volver
Cada vez otra vez

Cada vez, otra vez has de volver
Pues quiero amarte por siempre, no te quiero perder

Cada vez, otra vez has de volver
Si te he dado tanto cariño, aún lo debes tener

Cada vez, otra vez has de volver
La fuente de nuestro amor sigue
Fluyendo y yo lo sé, yo lo sé, yo lo sé.

Chica Vuelve

Cada vez, otra vez has de volver
No es fácil olvidar cuando se sabe amar, cuándo vas a volver

Cada vez, otra vez has de volver
Siempre te esperaré pues volverás, cada vez, otra vez y otra vez",True,True,32041122.0,salsa

LYRICS: 
We can make it further, we running and don’t look back 
It’s a light at the end of the tunnel if you stay on track 
But I know any minute when your fingers turn it up like snap
So hard to lose like that (hey)
 
Let’s do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn up the sunshine
Think about it 
All the boys and girls
You gotta turn up the sunshine, you gotta turn up the sunshine
Said it’s been a long night, long night 
Waiting for the light, waiting for the light
Let’s do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn it up
Make it hard to lose like that 
 
You want it, you got it 
I’m with it if you do it like that 
It’s brighter now when the colors of the rainbow flash 
We gotta keep it moving 
Make a change so it don’t change back 
So hard to lose like that 
 
Let’s do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn up the sunshine
Think about it 
All the boys and girls
You gotta turn up the sunshine, you gotta turn up the sunshine
Said it’s been a long night, long night 
Waiting for the light, waiting for the light
Let’s do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn it up
Make it hard to lose like that
 
If this weather makes you frown
And some people get you down, remember
Love like sound, it’s better when it’s loud
And if there’s no song inside
We can bring the light together
Day or night, we’re shining from inside
 
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the sunshine
 
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the sunshine
 
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the sunshine
 
Turn up the, turn it up (ahh)
Turn up the, turn it up (ahh)
Turn up the, turn it up (ahh)
Turn up the sunshine (ahh)
 
All around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn up the sunshine
Think about it 
All the boys and girls
You gotta turn up the sunshine, you gotta turn up the sunshine
Said it’s been a long night, long night 
Waiting for the light, waiting for the light
Let’s do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn it up
Make it hard to lose like that

Theme From Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To), by Diana Ross.  From the movie, Mahogany in the year 1975.

Do you know where youre going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you
Where are you going to?
Do you know...?

Do you get
What youre hoping for
When you look behind you
Theres no open door
What are you hoping for?
Do you know...?

Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies
That filled our minds
You knew how I loved you
But my spirit was free
Laughin at the questions
That you once asked of me

Do you know where youre going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you
Where are you going to?
Do you know...?

Now looking back at all we planned
We let so many dreams
Just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long
Before we see
How sad the answers
To those questions can be

Do you know where youre going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you
Where are you going to?
Do you know...?

Do you get
What youre hoping for

Lyrics:

[Eminem]
This ain't beef man
I don't know what the fuck to call it
But no beef
Whattup X?

I float like big spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly
Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'd have my motherfuckin ass kicked by Moby
if I let some bitch in the Can like 'Bis cop over me
to do war, and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop, to that level, to do that now
I got a new cat, this time I'm pullin two gats out
With bullets, I finally got somethin to shoot at now

[Xzibit]
Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who REALLY want they name in the streets
Let's see who wanna die the same time as me
and make ends meet
Now was I, blessed with a gift, or cursed with a curse?
I follow, hearse after hearse, with verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree, so now

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggaz be talkin, sayin my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you be addicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name

[Xzibit]
Why do you hate me? (Hate me) I came from nothin
Blood sweat and tears, you did not create me
How can you doubt me? (Doubt me) You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West coast without me
Cut with the bullshit (Bullshit) I struggle for survival
And now you tryin to act like my rival?
Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth
all the pain (all the pain) all the agony (all the agony)
All the horror (all the horrow) all the tragedy (all the tragedy)
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life? (C'mon!) One day you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the FUCK?! (Who the FUCK?!) you think you talkin to
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in FRONT OF YOU!

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I coulda been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him
purple, for mimickin him with two rappin Urkels
I coulda snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I ""Square Dance"" cause I'm sick of rappin circles
around these clowns, stready tryin to call me out
It's like I'm listenin to motherfuckin dogs meow
You'd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about - c'mon
(I) No gangsta you ain't either
(Will) But I know that I spit ""Ether""
(Not) I shoulda crossed your belly
(Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly
X, pass me the weed, I'ma put my ashes out on his ass
For the last time man.. [scratched] - ""Watch your fuckin mouth""

[X] Yeah.. 
[E] Ahh, ahh, E-Dub 

[Xzibit] 
It's that millenium ridiculous flow, I never let go 
Niggaz gettin knocked out is part of my show 
Let 'em know who they fuckin with yo, a rhyme wrangler 
Tri-angular push-up the hillside strangler 
Dangle a, nigga by the ankle off the balcony 
Now let his punk ass go, look out below (BELOWWWW) 
It's a tale of two cities, come out when the sun go down 
We officially not fuckin around 
Stuck in the ground, fitted with a suit in a pine box 
(hah!) with my fresh pressed khakis in a slingshot 
So heatbox all day in a nigga face 
and all you bitches see the dick that you shoulda ate 

[Chorus 2X: Xzibit *singing*] 
Call it what you wanna call it 
I'm a fuckin Alkaholik 
Bring it if you really want it 
Ain't gotta put no extras on it! 

[Erick Sermon] 
Yo, I'm in the zone, and lyrically gone 
Got the spot blown, BOOM! Oklahoma 
Watch the aroma, catch those who love me 
My underground dirty cats on dune buggies 
I be the type to take your watch and flaunt it 
Kidnap T. Lewis and Jimmy Jam on it 
Yo, I bang a nigga head til his neck pop 
Do a KRS-One to a ""Black Cop"" 
X and E's, out for cream 
Get the money, while you stay broker than Al Bundy 
Uhh, give it to y'all, in ""Any Given Sunday"" 
With J. Foxx name the spot, make it hot
(I hate E so much right now!) Blow it down hooker bounce 
come off the ropes like J. Snooka 
[*X*: Two fly motherfuckers] You can't fuck widdit 
Backed by +Open Bar+, so y'all forget it 

[Chorus] 

[J-Ro] 
J-McEnroe, cam smashin, party crashin 
I eat MC's like a ration 
I'm sockin niggaz in they goatees 
I leave you stiffer than that fool on my basketball trophies 
I'm in the room with 10 G's, countin ten G's 
cause we need a bag of weed (can you smell it?) 
Now we need ten dimes, to blow on deez like wind chimes 
Time to close the blinds cause you all in mines 
I bought a bottle for the session, and did not share it 
Drink so much Captain Mo' all I need is a parrot 
You took the Alkaholik challenge, and lost your balance 
You underground, we under water drinkin liquid by the gallons 

[Tash] 
Slurred words, double vision, brain bustin, head rushin 
Since I'm too drunk to walk, I rock a party on crutches 
and still rush the roughest MC who wanna get it 
Forget it, it's Likwit, Tha Liks and, Xzibit 
Ca-Tash on the blast the final piece to the puzzle 
I slap bitches on the ass I slap tits up out the muzzle 
I shuffle with the microphone, bang rhymes consistant 
You wack and I'm Ca-Tash and that's the motherfuckin difference 
For instance, ""21 and Over"" set your clocks back 
(Tick tock tick tock) Still standin where the rocks at 
Two-thousand-one, we still young guns that's +Restless+ 
(Thirty niggaz, sixty hoes) and that's the motherfuckin guestlist!

► LYRICS
[Xzibit]
Most niggaz get it confused right? Huh
They think it's all chronic and palm trees out this muh'fucka
Bitches and bikinis, listen, huh

Some niggaz is better left alone
I place you underneath the very ground you walkin on
And ain't no children in this motherfucker, drop your tone
Ain't got no business even FUCKIN with no microphones
So yo it's me against the world, and ain't got shit to lose
My heavy artillery built to make the masses move
I carry tools that'll pick you up and out your shoes
Xzibit bringin new meanin to alcohol abuse
I wanna fall up in the spot where all the bitches at
Holdin somethin heavy to help you straighten out your back
A couple of drinks and I bend you over the kitchen sink
So what you think I owe you somethin bitch for fuckin me?
(BITCH) Get a grip, misery love company, check it
Xzibit show you the difference between real life and makin a record
Makin the moves and connections that you never expected
What good is money and the fame if you never respected?
Check it out

[Chorus]
You know, who's runnin these fuckin streets
(You get involved, you gettin slapped with the heat nigga)
Don't be actin like your shit don't stink (c'mon)
Y'all ain't fuckin with X
You know, we roll so fuckin deep
(Yeah round after round in the middle of the street niggaz)
Cause you're actin like your shit don't stink

[Xzibit]
Yo, I ain't afraid of them fuckin invisible gats
you always bringin out in your raps
My shit'll quickly make you fold and collapse
My goal to strictly takin over the map, by any means
Hustle and make more tracks than a her-on fiend
Keep my enemies on a first name basis
and hate them niggaz like a skinhead racist
Chuck Taylors and fat laces
Stompin hoes through y'all turf
I hurt worse than actual childbirth
A chick can suck my dick til the big squirt (AH-AHH!)
The song work, so ain't no playin wit us
Findin out where you rest your head and I'm sprayin it up
The remains that's left behind can probably fit in a cup
You pressin your luck, you makin yourselves easy to touch
I'm from the home of the hit 'em up, only two ways
You droppin some shells or you get 'em up, back in the days
there was a time there was this woman that I want to keep up
but nowadays when I see you I'm just tryin to fuck
so check it out

[Chorus]
You know, who's runnin these fuckin streets
(The king of these West coast gangsta beats, niggaz)
Always droppin off nothin but straight heat
so stay the fuck out of the way
You know, we roll so fuckin deep
(Round after round in the middle of the street niggaz)
Cause you're actin like your shit don't stink
Y'all ain't fuckin with Dre

[Dr. Dre]
Thangs just ain't the same since he came out
Two thousand and one, came blew the game out
I heard you was hot {*huff*} blew your flame out
And got the nerve to believe you hold the same clout?
I thought I told you, keep my name out of your fuckin mouth
(But Dr. Dre!) See that's exactly what I'm talkin bout
That shit right there, that's all day long
Just don't stop, I gots to be alone at the top
Forever ready loaded and locked, with niggaz that'll circle yo' block
and let 'em pop til some bodies get dropped
It's Doc Holiday in the flesh
(Still) hold it down, represent, resurrect the West
(Still) holdin ground, touchin down, with my nigga X
(Still) send a couple through yo' chest if you disrespect
Dr. Dre comin back (shit) I never left
The number one ranked highest paid celebrity guest
That's eight digits, motherfuckers

[Chorus]
You know, who's runnin these fuckin streets
(You get involved, you gettin slapped with the heat nigga)
Don't be actin like your shit don't stink (c'mon)
Y'all ain't fuckin with X
You know, we roll so fuckin deep
(Yeah round after round in the middle of the street niggaz)
Cause you're actin like your shit don't stink (YO)
Y'all ain't fuckin with X",False,False,6884693.0,hip hop music

Lyrics:

I think you're truly something special (oh)
Just what my dream are really made of (dreams are really made of)
Let's stay together you and me boy (oh)
There's no one like you around, oh baby
Uh, uh, (ooh)
Desert Storm, uh (oh woah)
Uh, uh huh, uh, uh huh, uh (oh)
Yeah, yeah, oh, uh (oh)
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you now, I wanna be more than a friend of you now
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the 90's into 2 thou'
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
'Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vow's
Maybe, I'm speaking general now
But girl I'mma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikini's in the winter too now
What you think about, tan lines on the skin of you now
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'
On 5th Ave shopping spree's, and them dinners to Chow's
I ain't concerned what other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now
And I ain't jealous it's the principle now, I'm so into you
I really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
I really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
Come on ma, it's more than a flashin'
I woulda traded it all, in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashin'
Just off the shore, so you can hear when water be splashin'
The drop top three and a quarter we dashin'
The flawless diamonds, and the border we flashin'
The money, we oughta be stashin'
I make sure every quarter be cashed in, I can't really explain it
My friend be thinkin' I'm slippin', these girls be thinkin' I'm trippin'
What kinda weed he be smokin', what type of drinks he be sippin'
Sweet thing, just to think of you dippin'
Would have me with the blue's so hard, you would think I was crippin'
Now, you relaxin' in the Benz, credit cards with no limits
So you don't worry about maxin' when you spend
Ever since you've been askin' 'bout the friends
How'd you like it if, both our name's had Jackson on the ends, uh
I really like (I really like)
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it (I can't explain)
I'm, so into you (so into you)
I, really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you, it ain't because my whips is roofless
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary envy es dipped Jesus'
Other ballers look dumb when they press you, five and sixes
You don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Bein' a player was becoming too stressful
But every since, the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Barts, while the villa be painted
Just so we can get really acquainted (really acquainted)
The love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted
But I can't really explain it, uh, yeah
I really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
I really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it (can't explain it)
I'm, so into you
I really like (ooh, ooh)
What I feel, when I'm with you (with you)
You're a dream come true (you're, oh yeah, yeah)
Don't you ever leave my side (ever leave my side, oh no)
'Cause it feel so right (oh baby, oh I)
I, really like
What you've, done to me (boy, you)
I can't really explain it (oh I can't explain it)
I'm so into you (I'm so into you baby)
I really like.................

Lyrics:

I think you're truly something special (oh)
Just what my dream are really made of (dreams are really made of)
Let's stay together you and me boy (oh)
There's no one like you around, oh baby
Uh, uh, (ooh)
Desert Storm, uh (oh woah)
Uh, uh huh, uh, uh huh, uh (oh)
Yeah, yeah, oh, uh (oh)
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you now, I wanna be more than a friend of you now
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the 90's into 2 thou'
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
'Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vow's
Maybe, I'm speaking general now
But girl I'mma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikini's in the winter too now
What you think about, tan lines on the skin of you now
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'
On 5th Ave shopping spree's, and them dinners to Chow's
I ain't concerned what other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now
And I ain't jealous it's the principle now, I'm so into you
I really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
I really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
Come on ma, it's more than a flashin'
I woulda traded it all, in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashin'
Just off the shore, so you can hear when water be splashin'
The drop top three and a quarter we dashin'
The flawless diamonds, and the border we flashin'
The money, we oughta be stashin'
I make sure every quarter be cashed in, I can't really explain it
My friend be thinkin' I'm slippin', these girls be thinkin' I'm trippin'
What kinda weed he be smokin', what type of drinks he be sippin'
Sweet thing, just to think of you dippin'
Would have me with the blue's so hard, you would think I was crippin'
Now, you relaxin' in the Benz, credit cards with no limits
So you don't worry about maxin' when you spend
Ever since you've been askin' 'bout the friends
How'd you like it if, both our name's had Jackson on the ends, uh
I really like (I really like)
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it (I can't explain)
I'm, so into you (so into you)
I, really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you, it ain't because my whips is roofless
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary envy es dipped Jesus'
Other ballers look dumb when they press you, five and sixes
You don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Bein' a player was becoming too stressful
But every since, the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Barts, while the villa be painted
Just so we can get really acquainted (really acquainted)
The love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted
But I can't really explain it, uh, yeah
I really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
I really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it (can't explain it)
I'm, so into you
I really like (ooh, ooh)
What I feel, when I'm with you (with you)
You're a dream come true (you're, oh yeah, yeah)
Don't you ever leave my side (ever leave my side, oh no)
'Cause it feel so right (oh baby, oh I)
I, really like
What you've, done to me (boy, you)
I can't really explain it (oh I can't explain it)
I'm so into you (I'm so into you baby)
I really like.................

Lyrics:

Uh-huh, yeah
This moment they all been waiting for, playboy
We here now
We're in the house now, for sure
Girl, I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

I assume, I'm so into you
'cause even before we hit the bedroom I was friends with you
If they ask, I ain't gotta say whom in them interviews
My sweet thing never believe them rumors that been true
The fact I had numerous friends, it's true
But you was wifey could change me into a groom in a minute boo
Maybe my sense of humor gets into you
But girl, they can make a perfume from the scent of you
I wanna take you there, feel like June in December too
So what you think about Cancun till the winter through
I don't know what the other consumers you been with you
I put a day aside to go to Bloomies and spend with you
Like any other man I will zoom to the clinic too
Now I wanna see if me and my junior's identical
I zoom, put a moon on the skin of you
I swear to everything that same afternoon will begin to move, feel me",True,True,20407932.0,hip hop music
