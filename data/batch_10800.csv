Mi Mayor Atracción..

Desde que te vi robastes mi atención,
Demasiado bella eres mi tentación,
Desde que te vi bañadita en sudor,
Eres mi mayor atracción..

Desde que te vi robastes mi atención,
Demasiado bella eres mi tentación,
Desde que te vi bañadita en sudor,
Eres mi mayor atracción..

Atrévete a decírmelo,
Admite que te gusta no digas que no,
Acéptalo ya de una vez y vámonos,
Pasemos esta noche solitos los dos..

Atrévete a decírmelo,
Admite que te gusta no digas que no,
Acéptalo ya de una vez y vámonos, (Vámonos)
Solitos los dos..

Aquella noche cuando la vi caminando,
Me llamó a la atención,
Me subió la presión,
Yo no le dije que me siguiera los pasos,
Por alguna razón,
cuando ella se me dio.

Si ella supiera,
Si algún día ella entendiera,
Que me gusta demasiado
Y no me he olvidado de ella,
Cuanto quisiera que conmigo repitiera,
Lo que en sábanas..Hicimos como quiera.

Desde que te vi robastes mi atención,
Demasiado bella eres mi tentación,
Desde que te vi bañadita en sudor,
Eres mi mayor atracción..

Desde que te vi robastes mi atención,
Demasiado bella eres mi tentación,
Desde que te vi bañadita en sudor,
Eres mi mayor atracción..

La besé,
Me di cuenta que,
No hay otra mujer,
Que lo haga tan bien,
Me gustaría volverla a ver
Para robarle un beso otra vez.

Cuando la besé,
Me di cuenta que,
No hay otra mujer,
Que lo haga tan bien
Me gustaría volverla a ver,
Para robarle un beso otra vez.

Yo sé que te encanta así,
Hasta que se rompa el suelo,
Sígueme bailando así,
Suelta como gata en celo. (Ohh)

Yo sé que te encanta así, (Eh eh)
Hasta que se rompa el suelo, (Ohh)
Pues sígueme bailando así. (Eh ehh)

Desde aquella vez que la besé,
hallé lo que en otra no encontré, (Ehh)
Aquella vez que un beso le robé,
Fue cuando me di cuenta qué. (Ehh)

Desde que te vi robastes mi atención,
Demasiado bella eres mi tentación,
Desde que te vi bañadita en sudor,
Eres mi mayor atracción..

Desde que te vi robastes mi atención,
Demasiado bella eres mi tentación,

[Intro: Bad Bunny]
Yo quiero hacerte venir otra vez
Yo quiero verte de nuevo, bebé
Yo te bajo el mundo a tus pies (Wuh)
Por sólo verte chingando otra vez

[Coro: Zion]

Yo quiero darte darte duro como e'

[Verso 1: Bryant Myers]
Mi movie está en play, ya te has visto los trailers
Caile
Hoy yo quiero que tú me baile'
Yo te busco en la BM, tu jevo te busca en el Chrysler
Baja par apartament
Tú quieres hacer el amor sin que te amen
Dévorame, dévorame hasta que las gotas de calor se derramen
Yo voy a ser tu esclavo
A ti te gusta a- a- amanecer en Condado
Y te lo voy a meter en la suite del piso del número octavo
A ti te gustan los chavos
Mera baby, yo tengo es chavos
Y yo nunca ando solo, yo siempre salgo con 100 bandidos como El Cabo

[Verso 2: Zion]
Tú ya me conoces
Sabes bien mi nombre
Tú sabes que cuando yo le caigo pa' darte grites mi nombre
Tú sabes que soy el hombre
Que bellaca te pone
Que bellaca te pone
(Z Diddy)

[Verso 3: De La Ghetto]
Pues dime, baby, ¿qué quiere'?
Tú caile si puede'
Para que me baile en el tubo todas noches que te entretienen
Media libreta de sour y par de pacas de cienes
Lo hacemos toda la noche cuando me quitó los poderes
Yah
En ella invierto lo que me gano en los partys de to' los weekends
Enamorado de ese culo
Porque como en 4 bien rico lo mueve
La mando a buscar, la pongo a chingar en to' los diferentes hoteles
Parece que tiene un demonio
No para de temblar cuando to'a se viene
Baby tú sabes que como yo no hay do'
Un caile cuando sea te doy cómodo
Me gustan así, si
Que no paren de pedir, di
Pa' yo seguir dando
Hasta que se canse de venir

[Coro: Zion. De La Ghetto]

[Verso 4: Bad Bunny]
Pa' ti y pa' mí tengo sei' phillie enrolado'
Caile a la presidencial en Condado
Lo que me hiciste yo no lo he olvidado
Tú eres mi stripper, yo quiero un privado
Baby, hazme tu coreografía
Ese booty es de pornografía, yeh
¿Por que tú me porfía'?
Si tú sabes que yo me sé tu biografía
Yo sé que en hombres no confía'
Pero ese culo me lo fía'
Caile, la Moët ya está fría
Baby Rasta te choca la fía
Pa' ti y pa' mí tengo sei' phillie enrolado'
Caile a la presidencial en Condado
Lo que me hiciste yo no lo he olvidado
Tú eres mi stripper, yo quiero un privado

Mami más de dos razones yo no necesito
Si te veo el panty te lo quito
Me dice que si no la llamo a repetir es un delito
En su cama estoy invicto

(Zion)
Quiero acesar tu piel
Recuerdo la primera vez
Que te esnuaste y me dijiste papi amárrame 
Hazme sexo salvaje baby

Dicen que soy el malo pero yo
Soy el que sacude to’ tu cuerpo
Tu diablo tu calor
Mami esto no fui yo
Es que ahí te gustan bandoleros 
Que te den con maldad que te den sin perdón 
Babyyy

Yo soy el que sacude to tu cuerpo
Tu diablo tu calor 
Mami esto no fui yo
Es que a ti te gusta con maldad
Que te den sin perdón 
Que te jale el pelo
Uaaaa uaa uaaa uaaaa

(Anuel)
La corta llena de pólvora como en el Navy
Porque aquí se ensucia y no pa modelarle los jeans
Si ese culo es la NBA yo soy Dwayne en los Heat
Tu estás hackia lo mismo si estuviera natural o opera
Sin bracier porque quiere los 2 aretes marcau
Tus amigas de este lau 
Ta tan rica que me vine pero no se me ha bajau
Te quiero desprender la luz suena como una full
Tu me vez y rapido moja y lo sabes tú
Después nos vemos en Lambo amarillo Pikachu 
Pa’ no aburrirme no pongas canciones mías en YouTube
Y si tú quieres volver a verme
Toy disponible pa chingar de viernes a jueves 
Tu familia dicen que van a matarme
Chingame como si no vas volver a tenerme

(Zion)
Dicen que soy el malo pero yo
Soy el que sacude to tu cuerpo
Tu diablo tu calor
Baby esto no fui yo
Es que a ti te gustan bandoleros 
Que te den con maldad
Que te den sin perdón

Yo soy el que sacude to tu cuerpo 
Tu diablo tu calor
Baby esto no fui yo
Es que a ti te gustan bandolero
Que sea un hijueputa

(Randy)
Mami tu la palte’ 
Quiero felicitarte
Si fuera Picasso tu fueras mi mejor arte
Nena si te busco es porque tengo ganas de darte
Ese culo es tuyo mami
Ven y comparte
Te gustan bandoleros
 Y yo que soy un cuero
Nos montamos en la Mercedes 
Y hacemos un reguero
23 posiciones pa’ que cantes mis canciones
Tu me vas a pedir que te meta sin condones
Que cojones
Aquí se gasta chavos con cojones
La semana pasa le mande a hacer los melones

(Zion)
Quiere que la amarre y que la lamba toa’
Le hago daño y vuelve que yo soy su droga
Solita se moja, se explota la rola
Ella es mi blanquita y la voy a dejar roja
(Yea)
Baby no te vallas a resistir
Que estoy loco por dejártela adentro
No puedes vivir sin mi
Estamos claros que contigo conecto
Uaaa ua uaaa
Es masoquista ella va a volver
Uaaa ua uaaa

Letra:

Jugar con mi mente esta en tu naturaleza
Se te hace muy fácil
Trate de sacarte de mi cabeza
Pero casi casi
Los días pasan, las horas vuelan
Me pongo loco si te me pegas
Te voy hacer de to aun que no deba
Y tranquila que entre nosotros se queda

Y yo se que tu dices que yo solo soy tu amigo
El que cuando no hay luz te hace de to
La cama fue testigo

Y yo se que tu dices que yo solo soy tu amigo
El que cuando no hay luz te hace de to
La cama fue testigo

Tu encuentro no es un encuentro casual para mi es algo ilógico
En mi vida un acto histórico
Tu me has llevado a mi a viajar en este amor platónico y viaje hasta aquí por un precio modico
Definitivamente tus labios tienen algo magnético
Debo tomarme algo energético
No quiero que se caiga este momento mágico
Por eso me pongo romántico
Zundada zundada zundada zun zundada
Zundada zundada zundada zun zundada

Zundada zundada yo dándote y tu sudada
Jalándote por pelo y tu mordiendo la almohada
Cuatro puntos en la nota pero llega la fuga y la nena se alborota
Un pikete cabrón de bichota 
Ella me debe algo y voy a cobrarle la cuota
Nadie va a hablar porque nadie nos ve
Antes era modelito ahora sale en TV 
En la cama flexible practica balet
La toque se moja toa yo me resbale 
Y es que ma con ese culo yo te lo juro que me caso
Ese voltaje que tu tienes por ahí esta escaso
Solo pide un pedazo dime que llegue y paso
Te recojo y traje los condones por si acaso

Siempre me acuerde de la noche aquella que pediste
Que te mojaras toa 
Porque te subio la nota de to lo que te metiste
Asi que te moje toa

Y yo se que tu dices que yo solo soy tu amigo
El que cuando no hay luz te hace de to
La cama fue testigo

Y yo se que tu dices que yo solo soy tu amigo
El que cuando no hay luz te hace de to
La cama fue testigo

LETRA

Estamo’ en la cancha baby
Llevaba tiempo
You miss me 
I know

Aguanta (jaja zaga)
Aguanta
Quiere perreo
Que quiere, perreo (ey eyy)

Es el cantante del ghetto, mi amor (ba-ba-boom boom)

Ella baila como haciéndolo (yea, Zaga)
Ella fue advirtiendome
Que el corazón no está sirviendole 
Ella solo quiere perreo
Pue’ta pa’ el reguleo

Como haciéndolo
Ella fue advirtiendome 
Que el corazón no está sirviendole 
Ella solo quiere perreo

Y fue pura fricción 
Uuuh
Cuando pusieron su canción
Y me montò la presión
(aguanta, aguanta)
Todo por diversión
 
Si salgo pa’ la calle, voy a buscarte
Yo me enamorè de ese culo grande
La de Monastery quiere que le cante
Es mi ghetto princess le gustan lo’ gangster

Me pide sexo
No quiere besos
Y yo bien necio
Me la como toda la noche

Yo soy tu papi
Mi mami chula
Yo te apago el incendio, tu calentura
Se pone mi cadena, se pone mi durag
Y perrea tan rico, que yo le digo

Ella baila como haciéndolo
Ella fue advirtiendome
Que el corazón no está sirviendole 
Ella solo quiere perreo
Pue’ta pa’ el reguleo 

Como haciéndolo 
Ella fue advirtiendome 
Que el corazón no está sirviendole 
Ella solo quiere perreo

Post-Estribllo

Y fue pura fricción 
Uuuuuu
Cuando pusieron su canción 
Y me montò la presión (aguanta, aguanta)
Todo por diversión 
(Zion baby)

Entre humo, culo y bareta 
Tu nariz rosa y los panty violetas 
Yo me hice loco y tu hiciste las tetas
Los más bellaco de la discoteca
To’ el gistro se te ve
Y el mahón apreta’o hace que yo te quiera ver
De’nudita en casa ya
Te quiero tener, quiero tener
Si se lo da
De to’ te voy a hacer, te voy a hacer

Ella baila como haciéndolo (yea, Zaga)
Ella fue advirtiendome
Que el corazón no está sirviendole 
Ella solo quiere perreo
Pue’ta pa’ el reguleo 

Como haciéndolo 
Ella fue advirtiendome 
Que el corazón no está sirviendole 
Ella solo quiere perreo

Mamacita quiere tra-tra-tra, ey
Traquete Traquete Traquete Traquete
Tra-Tra
Dimelo mi amor
Ryan castro y el Zeta (Zion Baby)
Dimelo Baby

You say, you wander your own land 
But when I think about it, I don′t see how you can 
You're aching, you′re breaking 
And I can see the pain in your eyes 
Says Everybody's Changing, and I don't know why 
So little time 
Try to understand that I′m 
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game 
I try to stay awake and remember my name 
But Everybody′s Changing, and I don't feel the same 
You′re gone from here 
Soon you will disappear, fading into beautiful light 
'Cause Everybody′s Changing, and I don't feel right 
So little time 
Try to understand that I′m 
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game 
I try to stay awake and remember my name 
But Everybody's Changing, and I don't feel the same 
So little time 
Try to understand that I′m 
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game 
I try to stay awake and remember my name 
But Everybody′s Changing, and I don't feel the same  
Oh, Everybody′s Changing, and I don't feel the same

Keane - Nothing In My Way (Lyrics)

""A turning tide
Lovers at a great divide
why d'you laugh
When I know that you hurt inside?

And why d'you say
It's just another day, nothing in my way
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna stay
So there's nothing left to say?
And why d'you lie
When you wanna die, when you hurt inside
Don't know what you lie for anyway
Now there's nothing left to say

A tell-tale sign
You don't know where to draw the line

And why d'you say
It's just another day, nothing in my way
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna stay
So there's nothing left to say
And why d'you lie
When you wanna die, when you hurt inside
Don't know what you lie for anyway
Now there's nothing left to say

Well for a lonely soul, you're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul, you're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul, it seems to me that you're having such a nice time
You're having such a nice time

For a lonely soul, you're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul, you're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul, it seems to me that you're having such a nice time
You're having such a nice time""

Lyrics below:
This is the last time
That I will say these words
I remember the first time
The first of many lies
Sweep it into the corner
Or hide it under the bed
Say these things that go away
But they never do
Something I wasn′t sure of
But I was in the middle of
Something I forget now
But I've seen too little of
The last time
You fall on me for anything you like
Your one last line
You fall on me for anything you like
And years make everything right
You fall on me for anything you like
And I, no, I don′t mind
This is the last time
That I will show my face
One last tender lie
And then I'm out of this place
Tread it into the carpet
Or hide it under the stairs
You say that some things never die
Well, I tried, and I tried
Something I wasn't sure of
But I was in the middle of
Something I forget now
But I′ve seen too little of
The last time
You fall on me for anything you like
Your one last line
You fall on me for anything you like
And years make everything right
You fall on me for anything you like
And I, no, I don′t mind
The last time
You fall on me for anything you like
Your one last line
You fall on me for anything you like
And years make everything right
You fall on me for anything you like
And I, no, I don't mind

Lyrics below:  
I'm going back to a time when we owned this town
Down Powder Mill Lane in the battlegrounds
We were friends and lovers and clueless clowns
I didn't know I was finding out how I'd be torn from you
When we talked about things we were gonna do
We were wide-eyed dreamers and wiser too
We'd go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café
I'm begging you for some sign, but you've still got nothing to say
Don't turn your back on me, don't walk away
I'm a better man now than I was that day
Let's go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café
Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier
Watch the drunks and the lovers appear to take turns
As the stars at the Sovereign Light Café
I wheel my bike off the train
Up the North Trade Road
Look for you on Marley Lane
In every building, every street sign
Oh why did we ever go so far from home?
You've got nothing to hide, you can't change who you really are
You can get a big house and a faster car
You can run away boy, but you won't go far
Let's go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café
Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier
Watch the drunks and the lovers appear to take turns
As the stars at the Sovereign Light Café
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-di-day
Yeah, I'm going where the people know my name

Lyrics below:  
In a city like mine there's no point in fighting
I close my eyes, I see you and me driving
If I am a river, you are the ocean
Got the radio on, got the wheels in motion
We were silenced by the night
But you and I, we're gonna rise again
Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to then
I lie in the dark, I feel I'm fallin'
Feel your hand on my back, hear your voice callin' me
I'm out of my depth, girl, stick close to me
Because the people in this town, they look straight through me
We were silenced by the night
But you and I, we're gonna rise again
Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to then
'Cause baby, I'm not scared of this world
When you're here
No baby, I'm not scared of this world
When you're here
Oh-oh-oh
You and I, we're gonna rise again
Oh-oh-oh
You and I, we're gonna rise again
We were silenced by the night
But you and I, we're gonna rise again
Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to then

LETRA:
 
Si ella supiera 
Que por las noches bailas conmigo 
A la luz de los faros de un coche 
Con la luna de único testigo 
 
Que tú me elevas 
Y que en tus brazos me llevas al cielo  
Cada vez que se escapa un “te amo”  
El tiempo se vuelve de hielo.  
 
Si ella supiera que en cada palabra que sale de tu boca  
Mi voz se cuela…  
 
Ay Dios, si ella supiera lo que hacemos los dos.  
Ay Dios, si ella supiera lo que hacemos tú y yo,  
Si ella supiera que estando contigo  
Desaparece todo lo prohibido  
Si ella supiera que pueden amarse dos desconocidos.  
 
Provocaste un seísmo que lo pudo sentir 
hasta el niño inocente que aún habita en mi 
El espejo no miente, me veo diferente  
Y aunque suene injusto y cruel, 
No sospecha nada, de que estoy contigo  
De que mi universo comienza en tu pecho y 
Termina en tu ombligo…  
Si ella supiera que en cada palabra que sale de tu boca  
Mi voz se cuela…  
 
Ay Dios, si ella supiera lo que hacemos los dos.  
Ay Dios, si ella supiera lo que hacemos tú y yo,  
Si ella supiera que estando contigo  
Desaparece todo lo prohibido  
Si ella supiera que pueden amarse dos desconocidos.  
 
Déjame recorrer tu cuerpo con mi boca, 
Deja la lengua arder como un volcán   
Si sobra hasta la piel, qué hacemos con la ropa?  
al abrazarte fuerte puedo volar 
 
Dejemos que la Magia nos venga a ver  
Entrelazados a mil metros del suelo 
Que no nos quede nada por esconder, 
Y que se entere el mundo que por ti me muero.",True,True,14250436.0,pop music

LETRA

Bailar bajo la luna es coser dos corazones,
en el espacio-tiempo, Amor,
con mucho cuidado y sin tirones.
Quiero ser como un mono de esos de los documentales.
Apretar nuestros cuerpos hasta fundirnos como metales.
Y que el frío no cale en los huesos,
aunque veamos pingüinos delante,
porque yo quiero hacértelo lento,
quiero amarte, quiero amarte.

Dame tu mano y bailemos un bolero,
prometo llevarte al cielo,
procuraré dejarte la distancia justa,
así tú no te asustas.
Y en este bendito cuerpo a cuerpo,
a mi me surge la gran pregunta:

¿cómo me vas a decir te quiero,
si ya tenemos La Boca Junta?

¿cómo me vas a decir te quiero,
si ya tenemos La Boca Junta?
 
Tú llegaste y lo cambiaste todo,
yo no era nadie y lo entregaste todo,
yo que pensaba que iba a ser igual,
pero te desnudaste y eso a mi me puso mal.
Aquí me tienes llamando doctores pa´ que me mejoren,
no sé qué me pasa.
Ahora que te tengo solo compro flores, dedico canciones,
no sé qué me pasa.
Estoy contando los lunares de tus brazos,
y con mis besos recorriendo tu cuerpazo,
paso a paso pa´ que nos dure
paso a paso pa´ que nos dure

Aquí me tienes llamando doctores pa´ que me mejoren,
no sé qué me pasa.
Y ahora que te tengo solo compro flores, dedico canciones,
no sé qué me pasa.

Y que el frío no cale en los huesos,
aunque veamos pingüinos delante,
porque yo quiero hacértelo lento,
quiero amarte, quiero amarte.

Dame tu mano y bailemos un bolero,
prometo llevarte al cielo,
procuraré dejarte la distancia justa,
así tú no te asustas.
Y en este bendito cuerpo a cuerpo,
a mi me surge la gran pregunta:

Letra:
Hay momentos para todo
Pero nunca todos van a estar ahí en cualquier momento
Si tan solo esperas a qué las cosas suceden tan solo sucede el tiempo
He perdido más por no hacer nada que mirando como se pierde el intento
Me he sentido bien porque me miento

Y ya ves que las cosas no son siempre como las pintamos
Yo puedo morir de frío y afuera es verano
Te juro, te engaño, te dejo y te extraño
Te quiero y te hago daño sin razón

Mejor desde cero
Que decir desde nunca
¿Y cómo darte el cielo
Si nunca pisé la Luna?
¿Y cómo soy sincero si nadie me pregunta?
Si me ves separado es porque todo se me junta

Se me junta tu mirada con la mía
Se junta la honestidad y la hipocresía
Se me junta cada rostro de ignorancia
Que yo intento hacer parecer sabiduría
Se me juntan los recuerdos de tus besos
Esos que ya pertenecen al pasado
Y te extraño cada noche, lo confieso
Aunque juré que no estoy enamorado

Quiero ver el modo antes que mi miedo
Quiero verme solo pa' ver si puedo
El precio de los mejores momentos
Siempre ha sido tener que echarlos de menos
Me acerco a tu llama y hoy me congelo
Y entre mis mitades ¿quién es el bueno?
Y nunca tuve el coraje suficiente
Pa' decir yo voy a me quedo

Mejor desde cero
Que decir desde nunca
¿Y cómo darte el cielo
Si nunca pisé la Luna?
¿Y cómo soy sincero si nadie me pregunta?
Si me ves separado es porque todo se me junta

Sí no entré la razón antes de entrar en ti
Lo tenía todo pa' no ser feliz
Y nunca me dio por vivir la vida pero sí fingír
Porque sonreí cuándo dijé yo puedo en vez de en fin
Cambié el azar por el hacer por mí
Rompí el camino pa' poder seguir

Mejor desde cero
Que decir desde nunca
¿Y cómo darte el cielo
Si nunca pisé la Luna?
¿Y cómo soy sincero si nadie me pregunta?
Si me ves separado es porque todo se me junta

Letra 

Me está gustando la mujer que poco a poco he podido rescatar
Tenías razón cuando decías aquel día que tenía que cambiar

Tenía que cambiar de novio y compañero
Tenía que empezar de cero y arrancarte de raíz
Debía saber que cuando más feliz me vieras
Ibas a volver por mi

Pues para ti el amor
Nunca fue primero, siempre estuvo de tercero
Tú y luego tú y después yo si es que pasaba por tu mente

Pues para ti el amor
Nunca fue primero, era como andar soltero
Yo ando enamorada y convencida de que ya no quiero verte

Ya ni te preocupes como estoy
Que te preocupe la siguiente

Y qué esperabas de este perro callejero
Que le enseñaron de todo menos a amar
Yo la cagué porque dejé que hablara el miedo
Y me callé lo que no se debe callar
Y mientras crees que ando pensando en la siguiente
Sigo llorándole al recuerdo todavía
Fui tan cobarde cuando te tuve aquí en frente, no detuve tu partida

Pues para ti el amor
Siempre fue primero, nunca estuvo de tercero
Yo y luego yo 
y después tú si te acordabas de quererte

Pues para ti el amor
Siempre fue primero, nunca estuvo de tercero
Vas enamorada y convencida de que ya no quieres verme

Y aunque ya no importe, corazón
Si no eres tú, no habrá siguiente

Pues para ti el amor
Pues para mí el amor
Nunca fue primero, siempre estuvo de tercero
Tú y luego tú y después yo si es que pasaba por tu mente

Pues para ti el amor
Siempre fue primero, nunca estuvo de tercero
Vas enamorada y convencida de que ya no quieres verme

Ya ni te preocupes como estoy
Que te preocupe la siguiente

Sé
Que hay en tus ojos con solo mirar,
Que estás cansado de andar y de andar
Y caminar
Girando siempre en un lugar

Sé
Que las ventanas se pueden abrir,
Cambiar el aire depende de ti…
Te ayudará, Vale la pena una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda,
Quitarnos los miedo, dejarlos afuera…
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Vale más el presente que el futuro,
Dale suave que aquí no hay apuro
Ya salimos adelante, ya no le des mente
Y abrazo pa´ toda mi gente.

É melhor perder-se que nunca embarcar
Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
E assim será
E a vida muda, mudará.

Sé
Que en lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza algún día se irá y así será
La vida cambia y cambiará

Sentirás que el alma vuela
Por cantar una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, echarlos pa fuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro
con el corazón

Letra:

TÙ NO ME HAZ DICHO QUE TE VAS 
Y YO QUE YA LO SIENTO
COMO UN PRESENTIMIENTO
DICES TE QUIERO, PERO SE QUE NO
SIGUES ESTANDO AL LADO MÍO,
PERO YA TE FUISTE,
LO QUE ANTES TE GUSTABA
ES JUSTAMENTE LO QUE TE ALEJO

PUEDO VER
TUS CAJONES YA VACÍOS,
ESOS QUE ANTES FUERON MÍOS
HOY NO QUIERO NI TOCARLOS
PA’ VER SI ME ENGAÑO
Y QUIERO SABER
COMO ES QUE SECA UN RÍO
COMO DEL CALOR AL FRÍO
CAMINAMOS  SIN PENSARLO
HOY SOLO QUEDA EL DAÑO 

Y YO QUE TE VI
PASANDO
 NAVIDAD CONMIGO
 Y YO QUE ME VI 
CONOCIENDO A TUS AMIGOS
CONTIGO VI FUTURO RELATIVAMENTE FÁCIL
Y YO QUE NOS VÍ
Y YO QUE NOS VÍ
COMO LOS VIEJOS DEL TITANIC

Y QUE ME HARÉ CON LAS TAQUILLAS DEL CONCIERTO
Y EL HOTELITO RESERVADO PARA EL VIAJE,
QUE VOY HACER DE ESTE BAÙL DE MIL RECUERDOS
Y MI TELÉFONO CARGADO MENSAJES
QUE VOY A HACER CUANDO PREGUNTEN LOS AMIGOS
HACERME EL DURO AUNQUE QUISIERA DERRUMBARME
TU NO TE HAZ IDO Y YO ESTOY HACIENDO PLANES PA EXTRAÑARTE

Y YO QUE TE VI
PASANDO
 NAVIDAD CONMIGO
 Y YO QUE ME VI 
CONOCIENDO A TUS AMIGOS
CONTIGO VI FUTURO RELATIVAMENTE FÁCIL
Y YO QUE NOS VÍ
Y YO QUE NOS VÍ
COMO LOS VIEJOS DEL TITANIC

Letra:

SI ME CALLO VOY DE A POCO
DESTRUYENDOME POR DENTRO
AGONIZANDO DESPACIO
Y ME CREO QUE NO TE PIENSO
Y AL DECIRLO YA HAZ LLEGADO
OCUPANDO TANTO ESPACIO
AY DE MI 
SI ES QUE ME BESAS
BENDITAS MANOS SI TU CUERPO SE LE ACERCAN
AY DE TI 
SI ES QUE ME PIENSAS
QUE ME DEDICO
A ANDAR BORRANDO TU TRISTEZA

SI VIERAS TODO LO QUE YO EN TI VEO
COMPRENDERIAS
VIDA MIA PORQUE ESPERO
SI ME ARROPASTE EL PENSAMIENTO
Si AHORA RECORRES MIS ADENTROS
SI SUPIERAS VIDA MIA LO QUE VEO


QUIERO HABLAR CON TUS SILENCIOS
DONDE HABITAN LOS RECUERDOS
LOS QUE A NADIE LE COMPARTES
Y SOLTAR LOS NUDOS VIEJOS
Y ENTRE MIRADAS Y BESOS
HACER VIDA POR DELANTE
AY DE MI 
SI ES QUE ME BESAS
BENDITAS MANOS SI TU CUERPO SE LE ACERCAN
AY DE TI 
SI ES QUE ME PIENSAS
QUE ME DEDICO
A ANDAR BORRANDO TU TRISTEZA

VIERAS TODO LO QUE YO EN TI VEO
COMPRENDERIAS
VIDA MIA PORQUE ESPERO
SI ME ARROPASTE EL PENSAMIENTO
Si AHORA RECORRES MIS ADENTROS
SI SUPIERAS VIDA MIA LO QUE VEO

Lyrics: 

[Verso 1]
No te acerques tanto que me estás matando
Ya ni me responden estas manos
Vivo en el intento de poder
Apagar la hoguera

[Verso 2]
Cada risa tuya y el dolor amargo
Que dejas pintado al fin de cada abrazo
Y un 'te quiero' vino a aparecer
Y le dije: ""Espera""
[Pre-Coro]
Si escucho tu voz con tan solo un suspiro
Enciendes las luces que había de apagar
Ay, no te me vayas cuando acabe el vino
Te quieres quedar

[Coro]
Que muero
De tanto callar tan solo muero
De ganas de comerte a besos, muero

[Verso 3]
Sé de tus manías, de tus grandes miedos
Tu ciudad perfecta cuando seamos viejos
Y guardé tu esquina del sofá
Por si vuelves luego

[Pre-Coro]
Si escucho tu voz con tan solo un suspiro
Enciendes las luces que había de apagar
Ay, no te me vayas cuando acabe el vino (no te me vayas)
Te quieres quedar

[Coro]
Que muero
De tanto callar tan solo muero
De ganas de comerte a besos, muero
[Puente]
Se gastan los días, se pierde el momento
Y esta cobardía me quema por dentro
No salen las ganas, perdimos el tiempo
Nos ganó el silencio
Y al miedo le cuento
Y al miedo le cuento

[Coro]
Que muero
De tanto callar tan solo muero
De ganas de comerte a besos, muero

[Coro]
Ay, yo muero
De tanto aguantar tan solo muero
De ganas de comerte a besos muero
Yo muero
Muero

Lyrics:
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

LYRICS:
(John Morgan, Tully Kennedy, Kurt Allison, Lydia Vaughn)

I WOULDN’T MIND BEING ALONE
I WOULDN’T KEEP CHECKING MY PHONE
WOULDN’T TAKE THE LONG WAY HOME
JUST TO DRIVE MYSELF CRAZY
I WOULDN’T BE LOSING SLEEP
REMEMBERING EVERYTHING
EVERYTHING YOU SAID TO ME
LIKE I’M DOING LATELY

YOU, YOU WOULDN’T BE ALL
ALL THAT I WANT
BABY I COULD LET GO

IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU I’D BE GOOD BY NOW
I’D BE BETTER THAN BARELY GETTING BY SOMEHOW
YEAH IT WOULD BE EASY NOT MISS YOU
WONDER ABOUT WHO’S WITH YOU
TURN THE WANT YOU OFF
WHENEVER I WANT TOO
IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU
IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU

I WOULDN’T STILL CRY SOMETIMES
WOULDN’T HAVE TO FAKE A SMILE
PLAY IT OFF AND TELL A LIE
WHEN SOMEBODY ASKED HOW I’VE BEEN
I’D TRY TO FIND SOMEONE NEW
IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING I CAN DO
BABY IF IT WEREN’T FOR YOU
I WOULDN’T BE IN THE STATE THAT I’M IN

YEAH YOU
YOU WOULDN’T BE ALL
ALL THAT I WANT
BABY I COULD LET GO

IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU I’D BE GOOD BY NOW
I’D BE BETTER THAN BARELY GETTING BY SOMEHOW
YEAH IT WOULD BE EASY NOT MISS YOU
WONDER ABOUT WHO’S WITH YOU
TURN THE WANT YOU OFF
WHENEVER I WANT TOO
IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU
IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU
IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU 

IT WOULDN’T BE SO HARD TO SEE YOU
KNOW HOW MUCH I NEED YOU
WOULDN’T HATE THAT I STILL FEEL LIKE I DO
IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU

IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU
IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU

IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU I’D BE GOOD BY NOW
I’D BE BETTER THAN BARELY GETTING BY SOMEHOW

YEAH IT WOULD BE EASY NOT MISS YOU
WONDER ABOUT WHO’S WITH YOU
TURN THE WANT YOU OFF
WHENEVER I WANT TOO
IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU
IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU
IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU

IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU 
IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU 
IF I DIDN’T LOVE YOU

Lyrics:

Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weather man called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away,
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away,
Blown away",True,True,122522411.0,country music

Lyrics:

She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year

She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air""",True,True,82396154.0,country music

Lyrics:
Since the day they got married
He'd been praying for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football and be his pride and joy
He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed

[Chorus]
And now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl

[Verse 2]
Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it, he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her
The coach said, ""Hey, son, what's your problem?
Tell me, have you lost your mind?""
And Daddy said, ""You'll lose your free ride to college
Boy, you better tell her goodbye""

[Chorus]
But now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American

[Bridge]
And when they got married and decided to have one of their own
She said, ""Be honest, tell me what you want""
And he said, ""Honey, you oughta know
Sweet little, beautiful, one just like you
Oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American""

[Chorus]
Now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl",True,True,69449656.0,country pop

Lyrics:

You better take it from me, that boy is like a disease
You're running, you're trying, you're trying to hide
And you're wondering why you can't get free
He's like a curse, he's like a drug
You get addicted to his love
You wanna get out but he's holding you down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch

He's a good time cowboy casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
Looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life",True,True,69947717.0,pop music

Lyrics:

Hey, good girl (hey, good girl)
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you
What you're thinkin' about

You'll see a good boy (you see a good boy)
Gonna give you the world
But he's gonna leave you cryin'
With your heart in the dirt

His lips are dripping honey
But he'll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your love and
Go and throw away the key

Hey good girl (hey, good girl)
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man",True,True,79837447.0,country music

Show Yourself Lyrics:

ELSA
Every inch of me is trembling
But not from the cold
Something is familiar
Like a dream I can reach
But not quite hold

I can sense you there
Like a friend I’ve always known
I’m arriving
And it feels like I am home

I have always been a fortress
Cold secrets deep inside
You have secrets too
But you don’t have to hide

Show yourself
I’m dying to meet you
Show yourself
It’s your turn

Are you the one I’ve been looking for all of my life?!
Show yourself!
I’m ready to learn...

Ah-ah-ah-ah

THE VOICE
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

ELSA
I’ve never felt so certain
All my life I’ve been torn
But I’m here for a reason
Could it be the reason I was born?

I have always been so different
Normal rules did not apply
Is this the day
Are you the way
I finally find out why!!?

Show yourself!
I’m no longer trembling!

Here I am
I’ve come so far!
You are the answer I’ve waited for all of my life!
Oh, show yourself
Let me see who you are…

Come to me now
Open your door
Don’t make me wait
One moment more!

Oh, come to me now
Open your door
Don’t make me wait
One moment more!

CHORUS
Where the Northwind meets the sea

THE VOICE
Ah-ah-ah-ah

CHORUS
There’s a river

THE VOICE
Ah-ah-ah-ah

CHORUS
Full of memory

MEMORY IDUNA
Come my darling, homeward bound

ELSA
I am found!

ELSA AND MEMORY IDUNA
Show yourself!

CHORUS
Ah-ah

ELSA AND MEMORY IDUNA
Step into your power
Grow yourself into something new

MEMORY IDUNA AND CHORUS
You are the one you’ve been waiting for

ELSA
All of my life

MEMORY IDUNA AND CHORUS
All of your life

ELSA
Oh, show yourself

MEMORY IDUNA AND CHORUS
You

ELSA
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

CHORUS
Ah-ah-ah-ah

ELSA
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

CHORUS
Ah-ah-ah-ah

ELSA
Ah-ah-ah-ah!!!

Why was Elsa born with magical powers? What truths about the past await Elsa as she ventures into the unknown to the enchanted forests and dark seas beyond Arendelle? The answers are calling her but also threatening her kingdom. Together with Anna, Kristoff, Olaf and Sven, she'll face a dangerous but remarkable journey. In “Frozen,” Elsa feared her powers were too much for the world. In “Frozen 2,” she must hope they are enough. From the Academy Award®-winning team—directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, producer Peter Del Vecho and songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez—and featuring the voices of Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, Jonathan Groff and Josh Gad, Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Frozen 2” opens in U.S. theaters on Nov. 22, 2019.

Drunk (And I Don’t Wanna Go Home)

I’ve got some money in my pocket
Got some trouble on my tail
I can hear the dives a-knocking 
Guess I’m heading off the rails 
Singing ooh ooh ooh ooh
I’m talking about you-ooh-ooh-ooh
 
I’ve got some new best friends forever
See, I met ‘em at the bar
Well the whiskey goes down better 
When they don’t know who you are
Singing ooh ooh ooh ooh
I’m talking about you-ooh-ooh-ooh
 
Ooh gonna feel this in the morning
Ooh ‘cause I’m going hard tonight
 
So bartender, take my keys
What do you want from me
Baby I’m drunk and I don’t wanna go home
I’m not staying in to fight
I’m staying out all night
Baby I’m drunk and I don’t wanna go home
 
We don’t got to wait until the weekend
There’s always time for jumping off the deep end
So don’t you wait up tonight
Don’t worry I’ll be fine
Baby I’m drunk and I don’t wanna go home
 
Yeah
 
We’re in the bathroom getting chatty
There’s a line out in the hall
Tryin’ to be my Sugar Daddy
Getting’ handsy in the stall
Singin’-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I’m talking about you-ooh ooh ooh
 
You like my gin n’ tonic kisses
‘Cause you know they taste so sweet
And I know you’ve got your missus
But there ain’t no one like me
 
Talking about you-ooh ooh ooh
I’m talking about you-ooh ooh ooh
 
Ooh gonna feel this in the morning
Ooh ‘cause I’m going hard tonight
 
So bartender, take my keys
What do you want from me
Baby I’m drunk and I don’t wanna go home
I’m not staying in to fight
I’m staying out all night
Baby I’m drunk and I don’t wanna go home
 
We don’t got to wait until the weekend
There’s always time for jumping off the deep end
So don’t you wait up tonight
Don’t worry I’ll be fine
Baby I’m drunk and I don’t wanna go home
 
Well
I don’t wanna
Don’t wanna go home
I don’t wanna
 
So bartender, take my keys
What do you want from me
Baby I’m drunk and I don’t wanna go home
I’m not staying in to fight
I’m staying out all night
Baby I’m drunk and I don’t wanna go home
 
We don’t got to wait until the weekend
There’s always time for jumping off the deep end
So don’t you wait up tonight
Don’t worry I’ll be fine
Baby I’m drunk and I don’t wanna go home
 
Well
Ooh
I don’t wanna
Don’t wanna go home
I don’t wanna

LETRA
""Só Um Pagode""

Ô meu lovezinho, não fica assim comigo
Cê sabe que eu nunca vacilei contigo
Eu poderia tá te dando um perdido
Mas tô aqui ajoelhado te pedindo

Que vai ter cerveja, vai, vai
Tem mulher solteira, vai, vai
Mas eu te amo e você pode dormir em paz...

Ô, calma calma amor
Calma calma amor
É só um pagode deixa eu ir por favor

Ô, calma calma amor
Calma calma amor
É só um pagode que o Turma me chamou

Ô ô ô ô ô ô ô ô
É só um pagode que o Turma me chamou
Ô ô ô ô ô ô ô ô
É só um pagode que o Turma me chamou

| LETRA |
Não mexe com o coração que tá quieto
Não é esperto, vai acabar se apaixonando
Se corre o risco de sofrer saudade
Não é maldade, eu já vou logo avisando

É que o poder que essa boca tem
Deixa gostinho de vontade a semana inteira
E o B.O. vai ser gigante se eu gostar também
É que eu só jogo sério
Não entro em cama só por brincadeira

Eu sou o cara que seu ex vai odiar
Sua mãe vai amar
E você nunca vai esquecer
E depois que a gente se beijar
De quinta a quinta vai pedir pra mim o TBT

Letra:
Eu sei que você fala por aí que não
Jura que é de pedra o seu coração
Mas na madrugada vem me procurar

Eu era só um lance uma distração
O meu corpo era sua diversão
O nosso combinado era não ligar

Mas tá sentindo falta da cama amarrotada das coisas pela a casa
Cheiro de amor no ar
O cheiro de amor no ar

Caiu na madrugada e viu que tava errada, tá desesperada
Louca pra me encontrar
Bebe vem me procurar

-

Eu fico aqui pensando no que aconteceu
No fundo essa verdade não me convenceu
Queria tanto ter você aqui comigo
Me deu uma vontede de chorar, chorei
Mas por te amar demais eu já te perdoei
Não faz assim de novo, meu amor, que eu brigo

Quem ama pra valer, sente saudade
Eu só me preocupei porque é tarde

Se você soubesse o quanto eu morro de ciúme
Quando você sai com esse teu perfume
Dá uma vontade de prender você
Sempre tem alguém querendo ser teu namorado
Nem por um segundo eu saio do teu lado
Eu tenho tanto medo, amor, de te perder

LETRA
Fora dos Stories
(Shylton Fernandes / Saymon Marques / Breno Casagrande / Lucas Macenna)

Fiquei sabendo que tá se envolvendo
Com outra pessoa
Que o passado ficou no passado
E já me superou

Que a sua vida tá fluindo bem
Tá de vento em popa
E não tem tempo de lembrar do tempo
Que a gente se amou

Isso é o que cê diz
Do celular pra fora
Mas do coração pra dentro eu sei
Que é outra história

Posta que tá bem, que superou meu love
15 segundos fake de balada top
E fora dos stories?
E fora dos stories?
Que a vida de solteira tá dando mais sorte
Que o coração tá blindado mais que carro forte
E fora dos stories?
E fora dos stories?

Eu sei
Na vida real cê não disfarça muito bem...

Se um dia eu disser..
Que não te amo, é que eu te amo
Ainda mais, pode acreditar
Se um dia eu disser..
Que não te quero, é que eu te quero
O dobro ou mais, tenta imaginar

Não seimentir, meus olhos dizem mais que minha boca
Eu vejo que não tem saída, esse teu jeito meio louca
Me faz feliz, amor que vai durar pra toda vida

Lyrics:
Down here on Planet Zero
They swing that gavel hard
No words, no peace, no advocate
No signs of life so far

Better pray for the soul of the citizen
Better pray that you’re not erased
On your knees, for the life, you’re living
On your knees or you’ll be replaced

Replaced

Out here on Planet Zero
We live like no tomorrow
I think we’ve reached the ceiling
They’re canceling your feelings
On to better days
Or so they say
But I don’t think so
They’re murdering our heroes
Out here on Planet Zero

Look at me
I’m not looking for a favor
I’m just looking for an axe to grind
All hail power to the people
Except you
You check the box we don’t like

Don’t like
So bite your tongue ‘cause it might save your life

Out here on Planet Zero
We live like no tomorrow
I think we’ve reached the ceiling
They’re canceling your feelings
On to better days
Or so they say
But I don’t think so
They’re murdering our heroes
Out here on Planet Zero

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Shut the door
Say a prayer
Kill the lights
Bite your tongue ‘cause it might save your life
Shut the door
Say a prayer
Hold your breath
No one’s coming you’re the only one left

Down here on Planet Zero
There might be no tomorrow
I think we’ve reached the ceiling
They’re canceling your feelings
On to better days
Or so they say
But I don’t think so
They’re murdering our heroes
Down here on Planet Zero

Shut the door
Say a prayer
Kill the lights
Bite your tongue ‘cause it might save your life
Shut the door
Say a prayer
Hold your breath
No one’s coming you’re the only one left

Lyrics:
Put the minks down
No for real summertime all the freaks out
Nottingham still slapping off of 3/5
Young nigga probably beat the feds 3 times
And I kept it solid nigga each time
I’m 10 out of 10 still trying to free mines
This ain’t a regular Benz, it’s a S6
Get money fuck hoes and stretch shit
Y’all ain’t even see my best yet
I got now fuck the next nigga
I ain’t even gotta check niggas
One thing for certain, a nigga play with me he die in a hurry
50k a piece, bro fighting a murder and they retired my jersey but I still get off the bench
Glock teal with a switch still hitting licks
Everybody calling Dugg da nigga
Big homie but the littlest nigga
 
Living legend in the flesh
Had a million dollars back when I was wearing Guess
250 three times guess I had a Nina left
Hundred in the dope panel got it leaning the left
Pyrex glass handle yea shout out to my chef
Kitchen fork warm water yea shout out to myself
Send it on a paper towel but Ima need some plastic
Weight these flip those yea we doing gymnastics, on me
Count a million with my eyes close
And I can whip a whole one with a blindfold
And I can, get it to ya nigga next day, air
where ya at nigga, next day, there
Black tape nigga grey tape, seal
Street razor with the V cut, peel
God bless ya, here’s a scorpion stamp
Young Virgil Yea the off white, champ

TURNING PAGE
Written by: Ryan O'Neal

i've waited a hundred years.
but i'd wait a million more for you.
nothing prepared me for
what the privilege of being yours would do.

if i had only felt the warmth within your touch,
if i had only seen how you smile when you blush,
or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough,
i would have known what i was living for all along.
what i've been living for.

your love is my turning page,
where only the sweetest words remain.
every kiss is a cursive line,
every touch is a redefining phrase.

i surrender who i've been for who you are,
for nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart.
if i had only felt how it feels to be yours,
well, i would have known what I've been living for all along.
what i've been living for.

though we're tethered to the story we must tell,
when i saw you, well, i knew we'd tell it well.
with a whisper, we will tame the vicious seas.
like a feather bringing kingdoms to their knees.",True,True,247501664.0,Not Found

""Touch"" is from ""Atlas: II"" by Sleeping At Last - https://fanlink.to/Atlas2

Lyrics:

TOUCH

when will i feel this
as vivid as it truly is,
fall in love in a single touch,
and fall apart when it hurts too much?

can we skip past near-death clichés
where my heart restarts, as my life replays?
all i want is to flip a switch
before something breaks that cannot be fixed.

i know, i know- the sirens sound
just before the walls come down.
pain is a well-intentioned weatherman
predicting God as best he can,
but God i want to feel again.

rain or shine, i don’t feel a thing,
just some information upon my skin.
i miss the subtle aches when the weather changed,
the barometric pressure we always blamed.

all i want is to flip a switch
before something breaks that cannot be fixed.

invisible machinery,
these moving parts inside of me
well, they’ve been shutting down for quite some time,
leaving only rust behind.

well i know, i know- the sirens sound
just before the walls come down.
pain is a well-intentioned weatherman
predicting God as best he can,
but God i want to feel again,
oh God i want to feel again.

down my arms, a thousand satellites
suddenly discover signs of life.

When I see something beautiful, I’ll film it, then write a short piece of new music for that moment. Tiny film scores, if you will. Basically, I want to musically follow Mary Oliver’s beautiful “instructions for living a life: pay attention. be astonished. tell about it.”

Each “atom” song and video is/will be roughly 1 minute in length, which compliments our social media digital worlds (and short attention spans) and will be released spontaneously! First as posts on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc. Shortly after, each “atom” will be widely available on Spotify, Apple Music, etc.

In the same way that seeing something beautiful in the middle of my day feels kind of like an oasis, a tiny chance to catch my breath, the hope for “atoms” is to offer up that same meditative feeling in your Insta timeline or TikTok feed, or in the middle of your next “doom scroll” ..or when you’re way deep down a YouTube rabbit hole.

Because real-life atoms become molecules, once a handful of my “atoms” are released into the wild, I’ll do occasional “Molecule Sessions”, in which I will choose a few “atoms” (perhaps with your help?!) and expand on them, transforming them into something different! I’m very excited about what these tiny pieces of music may become!

This is ""atom 8” and is set footage of shadows of tree branches hitting the wall just so.

Lyrics:
May these words be the first 
To find your ears.

The world is brighter than the sun 
Now that you’re here.

Though your eyes will need some time to adjust 
To the overwhelming light surrounding us,

I’ll give you everything I have. 
I’ll teach you everything I know. 
I promise I’ll do better. 
I will always hold you close, 
But I will learn to let you go. 
I promise I’ll do better. 
I will soften every edge, 
I’ll hold the world to its best, 
And I’ll do better. 
With every heartbeat I have left 
I will defend your every breath, 
And I’ll do better.

’Cause you are loved. 
You are loved more than you know.

I hereby pledge all of my days 
To prove it so.

Though your heart is far too young to realize 
The unimaginable light you hold inside,

I’ll give you everything I have. 
I’ll teach you everything I know. 
I promise I’ll do better. 
I will always hold you close, 
But I will learn to let you go. 
I promise I’ll do better. 
I will rearrange the stars, 
Pull ‘em down to where you are. 
I promise, I’ll do better. 
With every heartbeat I have left, 
I’ll defend your every breath. 
I promise I’ll do better. 
I will soften every edge, 
Hold the world to its best. 
I promise I’ll do better. 
With every heartbeat I have left, 
I’ll defend your every breath,

Song Lyrics:

Home is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me around
I feel numb, born with a weak heart
I guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it, the better
We'll make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground, head in the sky
It's okay, I know nothing's wrong, nothing

Hi-yeah, I got plenty of time
Hi-yeah, you got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money, always for love
Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight

Home is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home, she lifted up her wings
I guess that this must be the place
I can't tell one from another
Did I find you or you find me?
There was a time before we were born
If someone asks, this is where I'll be, where I'll be

Hi-yeah, we drift in and out
Hi-yeah, sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home and
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me 'til my heart stops
Love me 'til I'm dead
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots, hit me on the head, I go
Ooh

Song Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself in another part of the world
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
And you may ask yourself, ""Well, how did I get here?""

[Chorus]
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

[Verse 2]
And you may ask yourself, ""How do I work this?""
And you may ask yourself, ""Where is that large automobile?""
And you may tell yourself, ""This is not my beautiful house""
And you may tell yourself, ""This is not my beautiful wife""

[Chorus]
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

[Bridge]
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was

[Verse 3]
Water dissolving and water removing
There is water at the bottom of the ocean
Under the water, carry the water
Remove the water from the bottom of the ocean
Water dissolving and water removing

[Chorus]
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

[Verse 4]
You may ask yourself, ""What is that beautiful house?""
You may ask yourself, ""Where does that highway go to?""
And you may ask yourself, ""Am I right, am I wrong?""
And you may say to yourself, ""My God, what have I done?""

[Chorus]
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

[Outro]
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, look where my hand was
Time isn't holding up, time isn't after us
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was (I couldn't get no rest)
Same as it ever was, hey let's all twist our thumbs
Here comes the twister
Letting the days go by (same as it ever was, same as it ever was)
Letting the days go by (same as it ever was, same as it ever was)
Once in a lifetime, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground

Song Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Ah, watch out
You might get what you're after
Cool babies
Strange but not a stranger
I'm an ordinary guy
Burning down the house

[Verse 2]
Hold tight
Wait 'til the party's over
Hold tight
We're in for nasty weather
There has got to be a way
Burning down the house

[Chorus 1]
Here's your ticket, pack your bags
Time for jumpin' overboard
Transportation is here
Close enough but not too far
Maybe you know where you are
Fightin' fire with fire

[Verse 3]
Ah, all wet
Hey, you might need a raincoat
Shakedown
Dreams walking in broad daylight
365 degrees
Burning down the house

[Chorus 2]
Ah, it was once upon a place
Sometimes I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work
And, baby what do you expect?
Gonna burst into flames, ah
Burning down the house

[Verse 4]
My house
Is out of the ordinary
That's right
Don't wanna hurt nobody
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
Burning down the house

[Chorus]
No visible means of support
And you have not seen nothin' yet
Everything's stuck together
And I don't know what you expect
Staring into the TV set
Fightin' fire with fire, ah

Song Lyrics:

[Intro]
Well, we know where we're goin'
But we don't know where we've been
And we know what we're knowin'
But we can't say what we've seen
And we're not little children
And we know what we want
And the future is certain
Give us time to work it out

[Verse 1]
We're on a road to nowhere
Come on inside
Takin' that ride to nowhere
We'll take that ride
I'm feelin' okay this mornin'
And you know
We're on a road to paradise
Here we go, here we go

[Verse 2]
We're on a ride to nowhere
Come on inside
Takin' that ride to nowhere
We'll take that ride
Maybe you wonder where you are
I don't care
Here is where time is on our side
Take you there, take you there

[Chorus]
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere

[Bridge]
There's a city in my mind
Come along and take that ride
And it's all right, baby it's all right
And it's very far away
But it's growing day by day
And it's all right, baby it's all right
Would you like to come along?
And you could help me sing this song
And it's all right, baby it's all right
They can tell you what to do
But they'll make a fool of you
And it's all right, baby it's all right
There's a city in my mind
Come along and take that ride
And it's all right, baby it's all right
And it's very far away
But it's growing day by day
And it's all right, baby it's all right
Would you like to come along?
You could help me sing this song
And it's all right, baby it's all right
They can tell you what to do
But they'll make a fool of you
And it's all right, baby it's all right

[Chorus]
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere

Song Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself in another part of the world
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
And you may ask yourself, ""Well, how did I get here?""

[Chorus]
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

[Verse 2]
And you may ask yourself, ""How do I work this?""
And you may ask yourself, ""Where is that large automobile?""
And you may tell yourself, ""This is not my beautiful house""
And you may tell yourself, ""This is not my beautiful wife""

[Chorus]
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

[Bridge]
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was

[Verse 3]
Water dissolving and water removing
There is water at the bottom of the ocean
Under the water, carry the water
Remove the water from the bottom of the ocean
Water dissolving and water removing

[Chorus]
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground

You may ask yourself, ""What is that beautiful house?""
You may ask yourself, ""Where does that highway go to?""

Supertramp's ""Breakfast In America"" was the biggest selling album in the world in 1979. 

It spawned several hit singles and went on to win two Grammy Awards and sell in excess of 20 million copies. On the album's release Supertramp embarked on a 10 month world tour which arrived in Paris at the end of November. 

These 4 shows from the Pavillon de Paris were all recorded and the last two were filmed. The audio went on to form the basis of the 1980 live album ""Paris"" but the film was never released.  As bonus features, we include five tracks recorded on the night (but for which there is no film) using montage visuals: ""Ain't Nobody But Me"", ""You Started Laughing (When I Held You In My Arms)"", ""A Soapbox Opera"", ""From Now On"" and ""Downstream"".

Lyrics:

Step one, you say, We need to talk.
He walks, you say, Sit down. It's just a talk.
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Lyrics:

I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, Where you been?
He said, Ask anything.

Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
To the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me""

📝Lyrics :

[Verse 1]
If I don't say this now, I will surely break
As I'm leaving the one I wanna take
Forgive the urgency, but hurry up and wait
My heart has started to separate

[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
I'll look after you

[Verse 2]
There now, steady love, so few come and don't go
Will you, won't you be the one I'll always know?
When I'm losing my control, the city spins around
You're the only one who knows, you slow it down

[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
I'll look after you
And I'll look after you

[Bridge 1]
If ever there was a doubt
My love, she leans into me
This most assuredly counts
She says most assuredly
[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
I'll look after you
After you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge 2]
It's always have and never hold
You've begun to feel like home
What's mine is yours to leave or take
What's mine is yours to make your own

[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh

Lyrics:

I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's got to be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind

Lyrics:

Some things we don't talk about
Rather do without
And just hold the smile
Falling in and out of love
Ashamed and proud of
Together all the while

You can never say never
While we don't know when
But time and time again
Younger now than we were before

Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Lyrics:

We're on an open bed truck on the highway
The rain is coming down and we're on the run
Think I can feel the breath in your body
We gotta keep on running 'til we see the sun

Oh you got a fire and it's burning in the rain
Thought that it went out, but it's burning just the same
And you don't look back, not for anything
'Cause if you love someone, you love them all the same
If you love someone, you love them all the same

Oh, I feel your heartbeat
And you're coming around, coming around, coming around
If you can love somebody, love them all the same
You gotta love somebody, love them all the same
Singing, oh, I feel your heartbeat

When my eyes are on u
숨 막힐듯한 전율
Oh you know you get me loose 
Make me go 비틀비틀 

A dance floor made for 2 
달이 부르는 선율
Oh it’s only me and u 
Make me go 비틀비틀 

You bring the demon out of me 
Blame it all on your body
We might be an hour late
We ain’t got no time to waste 

꿈을 꾸는 기분이야 
잡은 손을 놓지 마
내일은 안 중요해 
이 순간을 몰입해

Oh I got plenty
I done seen em’ all but of you there ain’t many said they win the race so I’m slow and I’m steady but can’t move this slow in a Bentley ohh 
You say you need a, a true lover someone to kiss and hug ya, you feigning for some touching (aye)
I could be all that and above
I just hope that I’m enough 
Cause I don’t ever do this 

When my eyes are on u 
숨 막힐듯한 전율
Oh you know you get me loose 
Make me go 비틀비틀 

A dance floor made for 2 
달이 부르는 선율
Oh it’s only me and u 
Make me go 비틀비틀 

춤을 추지 날 위해 
만취해 너의 향기에 
세상을 다 알기에
인생은 짧으니 시간을 맘껏 낭비해 

거리를 방황하자 우리
둘 뿐인 것처럼 말이야
아찔하고 위험할수록
내 심장은 뛰어
That’s why I love ya 

Oh I got plenty
I done seen em’ all but of you there ain’t many said they win the race so I’m slow and I’m steady but can’t move this slow in a Bentley ohh 
You say you need a, a true lover someone to kiss and hug ya, you feigning for some touching (aye)

숨이 막히게 아름다운 너만이 날 숨 쉬게 해 
날개도 없이 하늘을 날게 해
넌 나의 윤리고 법이자 세계 

You say you need a, a true lover someone to kiss and hug ya, you feigning for some touching (aye)
I could be all that and above
I just hope that I’m enough 
Cause I don’t ever do this

When my eyes are on u 
숨 막힐듯한 전율
Oh you know you get me loose 
Make me go 비틀비틀 

A dance floor made for 2 
달이 부르는 선율
Oh it’s only me and u 
Make me go 비틀비틀 

Make me go 비틀비틀

Make me go 비틀비틀

Lyrics: 

Soulja Boy: 
Draco

Hxllywood: 
Uh. Hxllywood. Yea Waaa. Remix
Girl I can be your sneaky link (Sneaky Link)
You my sneaky Link (sneaky link)
Other: (Chopper mouth sounds) Run It Up
Yeah (uh), ayy (uh), ayy, Uh

Hxllywood: 
Girl I can be your sneaky link (We sneaky)
 Be your sneaky link 
Girl I can be your sneaky link (We sneaky)
 Be your sneaky link (sneaky)
Girl I can be your sneaky link (Sneaky Link)
 Be your sneaky link (Sneaky Link)
 Girl I can be your sneaky link (Sneaky Link)
 Yea I am your sneaky link
 Aaayyyyy
 I said this beat gone make her clap go bizzurk

Soulja Boy:
 Yo, that’s the only plan
 Cash out on Bugatti shirt on Only Fans
 Beat the pot like Peter Pan
 Spin the block then spin again 
 She turn around like ceiling fan
 I make it rain 
M&Ms
 I’m breaking down a brick again
 In the trap and I’m whipping my wrist again
 Spin through the block with them choppers and hit at him
 Underneath it’s Pirellis ain’t riding on Michelins
 Yea 
I had to knock out the middleman
 Stand in the trap and I’m passing and I got rich again
 Yea, breaking down bricks again
 He come to the block and I’m serving him
 Twenty-Twenty Two Bugatti I’m swerving in
 Slow it down. Slow it down
 She working it
 Pop on the block 
 And they green like zucchini
 She slide and she eating
 She say that she sneaky
 I bust down that Cartier I slide on my 40
 I make it look easy
 We pop to the top like some pieces
 I’m swishing the cups and they looking like Reese’s 
 She makin it clap and my wrist in the freezer 

Hxllywood:
 And I heard you got a man 
 Hxllywood don’t give a damn
 I make lil mama jams
 So I know that you a fan
 Gone and dance for all these bands
 Like I am your only fan
 Girl I can be your only fan
 Girl you can be my sneaky link (we sneaky)
 But you my weakest link
 No cap bitch your pussy weak
 So what the fuck you think 
 I heard you got that sloppy toppy toppy
  You a thoty body
 Shorty got that body ody ody 
 Like she Megan probably
 In the Stu bitch I go stupid
 I can’t love no bitch No cupid
 Shorty slide just like she Nike
 I call her and she just do it
 Baby
 Shorty kind of crazy tryna get up in my pants
 Say she tryna have my baby but plan b the only plan

Kayla:
 Boy you just my sneaky link

Hxllywood:
 I am?

Kayla:
 So don’t keep texting me
 I’m not your bitch stop checking me
 You come last when he next to me
 His special bitch no recipe
 Like salt bae open sesame
 You calling while he sexing me
 I’m such a… Freak
 He cum fast when I say link
 Got him saved as Uber Eats
 What’s the plan I say plan b
 You can’t take me out the streets
 I’m fat mun nu a mami
 Aint no bun you just my link
 I got body and good brain
 He my break when my heart break
 I step on bitches’ neck then go ride they niggas chest
 He gon shoot cuz I’m the best
 I go temp cuz he a guest
 Save me last cuz I’m the best
 Before he eat I say god bless
 He be hearting all my shit
 But he could never picture this

Hxllywood:
 Yea Whaaa

Song Lyrics :

Be-Imaan
Dil Bada Be-Imaan
Hota Nahin Aasaan
Isey Hai Samjhana
 
Be-Imaan
Dil Bada Be-Imaan
Tere Liye Shaitan  
Meri Na Ik Maana...
 
Dil Jeetey Ya Main Jeetun
Dekhungi Dekhega Tu
Lo Dil Se Sharat Lag Gayee
 
Mujhe To Teri 
Lat Lag Gayee, Lag Gayee
Zamana Kahey Lat Ye Galat Lag Gayee

Mujhe To Teri Lat Lag Gayee, Lat Lag Gayee
Zamana Kahey Lat Ye Galat Lag Gayee

Haal Dil Ki Tum Zaroorat Ho...
 
Rokun

Haal Dil Ki Tum Zaroorat Ho...
 
Mujhko Bhi Tu Zaroori
Doobi Nashey Mein Poori

Mujhe To Teri Lat Lag Gayee, Lag Gayee
Zamana Kahey Lat Ye Galat Lag Gayee

Mujhe To Teri Lat Lag Gayee, Lag Gayee
Zamana Kahey Lat Ye Galat Lag Gayee 
Mujhe To Teri

Synopsis: 
Befikre is a story that celebrates being carefree in love.  A quintessential Delhi boy Dharam (Ranveer Singh) comes to Paris for work in search of an adventure. Just when he was about to embark on this journey of his life he bumps into a wild, free spirited, French born Indian girl Shyra (Vaani Kapoor).

A feisty romance ensues between the two in which both of their personalities - one being an equal match for the other are tested to the limit. Battling their ups and downs, both realize that love is a leap of faith that can only be taken by those who dare to love.

Lyrics:
Look me in the eyes
No rehearsed lines
I wanna know if it’s real
Then we can chill
we can chill
But first I need to know
If I appeal to more than your eyes
 
X2
 
No interruptions
You can say whatever
You
I promise I can take it
I know that you flirt
That’s not really a crime
But don’t you be giving
Nobody what’s mine
 
So tell me a sign
And boy if I like it
We can vibe
We can vibe
 
Look me in the eyes
No rehearsed lines
I wanna know if it’s real
Then we can chill
we can chill
But first I need to know
If I appeal to more than your eyes
 
Look me in the eyes
No rehearsed lines
I wanna know if it’s real
Then we can chill
we can chill
But first I need to know
If I appeal to more than your eyes
 
With your heart
Show me what you feel
When we’re apart
Your hands can’t be still
When you see my body
So tell me something
So you can get something
I know that you flirt
That’s not really a crime
But don’t you be giving
Nobody what’s mine
 
So tell me a sign
And boy if I like it
We can vibe
We can vibe
 
Look me in the eyes
No rehearsed lines
I wanna know if it’s real
Then we can chill
we can chill
But first I need to know
If I appeal to more than your eyes
X2
 
All I want is you to
Not play games with me
All I want is you to
Tell me what you feelin
 
All I want is you to x3

but i still be like

This the part where I’m gonna get hurt
i never listened and but didn’t deserve it

so they say that you live and you learn

Like ye she gone mess with you head
oh ye and she’ll flirt with your friends oh ye
make you wish you were dead
Everytime she moves on she says 
Don’t take it personal
Don’t take it personal
Everytime she moves on she says 

Who else knows, 
all my friends are blowing up my phone 
Somethings telling 
no no no no no no no no no

This the part where I’m gonna get hurt
i never listened and but didn’t deserve it
i was young and she was my first love
so they say that you live and you learn

Like ye she gone mess with you head
oh ye and she’ll flirt with your friends oh ye
make you wish you were dead
Everytime she moves on she says 
Don’t take it personal
