Lyrics:

If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used up all of my tricks,
I hope that you like this.
But you probably won't.
You think you're cooler than me.

You got designer shades,
Just to hide your face
And you wear them around like you're cooler than me.
And you never say Hey
Or Remember my name?
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me.

You got your high brow,
Shoes on your feet,
And you wear them around
Like they ain't shit.
But you don't know the way that you look,
When your steps make that much noise.""",True,True,466958525.0,pop music

Lyrics:
Let's run away from these lies
Back to yesterday, safe tonight

I feel the sun creeping up like tick tock
I'm trying to keep you in my head but if not
We'll just keep running from tomorrow with our lips locked
Yeah, you got me begging, begging

Baby, please don't go
If I wake up tomorrow, will you still be here?
I don't know if you feel the way I do
If you leave, I'm gonna find you
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go

Baby, please don't run away
From my bed and start another day
Stay instead

I feel the sun creeping up like tick tock
I'm trying to keep you in my head but if not
We'll just keep running from tomorrow with our lips locked
Yeah, you got me begging, begging

Baby, please don't go
If I wake up tomorrow, will you still be here?
I don't know if you feel the way I do
If you leave, I'm gonna find you
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go

I stay running from tomorrow

Lyrics: 
 
Hoodie on my head, cold breath in the air
People walking by like i’m not even there
Last three nights felt like a hundred years
 
I get paid for my pain long as I can make it rhyme
But sometimes I can’t tell if it’s even mine
Either way it’s beautiful, look at how it shines
 
It sounds like ooooo
it’s all in my head
Lightning and thundering
oooooo
i’m not dead yet
In case you were wondering
 
This is what a sad song sounds like
It’s been playing in my head for my whole life
It’s beautiful and cruel at the same time
ooooo,
yeah
 
And this is what a broken heart beats like
It’s tearin’ up my chest like a jackknife
But it gets me through the good and the bad times
This is what a sad song sounds like
 
This is what a sad song sounds like
 
Say it like you love me say it like you care
I know that I’m fucked up I don’t even care
When I close my eyes I swear I can disappear
 
It sounds like ooooo
it’s all in my head
Lightning and thundering
oooooo
i’m not dead yet
In case you were wondering
 
This is what a sad song sounds like
It’s been playing in my head for my whole life
It’s beautiful and cruel at the same time
ooooo,
yeah
 
And this is what a broken heart beats like
It’s tearin’ up my chest like a jackknife
But it gets me through the good and the bad times
This is what a sad song sounds like
 
This is what a sad song sounds like

Lyrics:

Once I throw on this
Once I throw on this
It's over girl
Once I throw on this
Once I throw on this
It's over girl

I hear you knock, knock, knock
Baby, come on up
I hope you got, got, got
Something in your cup
Cause I'm three shots deep
And I ain't trying to sleep
Get your red bull on cause I'm ready
You've been playing naughty
To get with me all night
We both know exactly what you want, right?
Tell me what you want though
Tell me what you gon' do
What you gon' do

Once I throw on this bow chicka wow wow
What you gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave
But I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky down down
Girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right
I'm a make you sound like
I'm a make you sound like",True,True,40281113.0,dream pop

Hoje não lembrei de você nem um pouco
Não pensei no seu rosto
Já consigo curtir outros sabores sem sentir seu gosto
Amém, amanheceu um dia novo
Ok, amar é bom, esquecer também
Viver com e viver sem
Poder dizer que curou e não ficou sequela
Seu sorriso já não me desespera
Não lembro do seu número de cabeça
Se começamos em novembro ou se terminamos numa terça
Nem sua cor preferida
Já fechou a ferida, querida
Não tenho mais medo da despedida
Eu já não sonho, não tenho pesadelo
Já não odeio e nem desejo
Os olhos não se enchem d’água
Não me sinto afogado
Lendo suas cartas, vendo seus retratos

Músicas de amor nunca mais, bebê
Músicas de amor nunca mais
Você pede e me espera
Mas a vida acelera
O sorriso a dor leva
Com fé o tempo traz

Músicas de amor nunca mais, bebê
Músicas de amor nunca mais
Você pede e me espera
Mas a vida acelera
O sorriso a dor leva
Com fé o tempo traz

Ainda, pra mim tanto faz quem errou, ficou pra trás
Não tô nem aí se tem outro
Nem aí se vai me cobrar
Ou se vai me dar o troco
Se aparecer lá em casa vai escutar que não tô
Forma mais educada de cantar dispiei
Várias linhas pra te dizer superei
Olhar seu rosto, não lembro do começo
Parece até que eu não te conheço
Será mesmo que existiu ou foi coisa que inventei
Quanto você sentiu, quanto que eu me entreguei
Quando que eu te perdi, quando que eu não enxerguei
Fato que eu desisti, não fui atrás, não procurei
Não perdi o sono e nem a fome
Não me interessa com quem e nem por onde
Até dou um sorriso quando me perguntam
E quase esqueço seu nome

Músicas de amor nunca mais, bebê
Músicas de amor nunca mais
Eu me prometi que não, não
Nunca mais ajo na emoção

Nem lembro mais qual seu perfume
Seu aniversário eu nem sei quando é
Outra noite, outra dose
Outra vez vou fingir que não te conheço
Se eu te ver numa rua qualquer

Músicas de amor nunca mais, bebê
Músicas de amor nunca mais
Você pede e me espera
Mas o tempo acelera
O sorriso a dor leva
Com fé o tempo traz

Músicas de amor nunca mais, bebê
Músicas de amor nunca mais
Você pede e me espera
Mas o tempo acelera
O sorriso a dor leva
Com fé o tempo traz

LETRA: 

Nem se aprontou, né bebê?
Já são meia-noite, tô na tua porta
Então melhor me atender
Tá se maquiando, se arrumando, ou saiu do banho, lady
Eu me acelerei pra te ver
Com essa deusa me envolver
Viver os pecados, prazer
Qual perfume tu tá usando?
Qual roupa que você tá vestindo?
Pra eu imaginar tirando
A gente ainda nem tá indo
Eu penso na gente voltando
Ou dependendo do caminho
Eu estaciono e deito o banco
Você me pedindo 
E acatando
E tacando

E admirando a viagem, os detalhes
Seus olhos, sua boca
Suas curvas, sua louca
Hipnotizado, vontade de falar que amo
Mas não vou entregar o jogo assim tão fácil

Sempre quando a noite vem
E você quiser alguém
É só me ligar, ok?

Relaxa, tá tudo bem
Sei tu não é de ninguém
Só quero curtir também

Sempre quando a noite vem
E você quiser alguém
Pode me ligar, ok?

Relaxa, tá tudo bem
Sei tu não é de ninguém
Só quero curtir também

Por que que eu fui me amarrar?
Mas tenho que manter minha marra
Mas é só você brotar e eu querer te agarrar
E querer que seja no quarto, nossa festa e farra

Nem preciso de baile, nem noitada
Na sua ou na minha casa?
Eu trouxe duas garrafas

Criminoso e criminosa lado a lado
E se eles falam do nosso passado
Nosso lance é bem maior, e faz todo o caso ser abafado

Você gemendo chamando meu vulgo
Você gemendo chamando meu vulgo
Você gemendo chamando meu vulgo
Você gemendo chamando meu vulgo

Sempre quando a noite vem
E você quiser alguém
É só me ligar, ok?

Relaxa, tá tudo bem
Sei tu não é de ninguém
Só quero curtir também

Sempre quando a noite vem
E você quiser alguém
Pode me ligar, ok?

Relaxa, tá tudo bem
Sei tu não é de ninguém
Só quero curtir também

LETRA: 

Contesta a glória, contexto e conteúdo
Não sabe da história, tu só vê o resumo
A ponta do iceberg
A escalada é um Everest
É muita porrada, Everlast 
Pra quem ainda duvida da minha caneta 
Aprendiz do Lírica Bereta
Também sou um preto de outro planeta 
Empregado do mês batendo meta
Raro igual o cometa
Correria, um guepardo, isso é selva não o seu quarto
Se tu fala o número errado
É tiro na 3x4
Pra lembrar do seu rosto só num retrato 
Armamento de chefe, faço o blindado dar ré 
Ameaças na net me soam como WWE 
Rolex e pulseiras ouro amarelo
É tipo um carro em cada pulso, eu não bato eu te atropelo 
No baile ou na guerra, é alto nível 
Posso ser o lança, míssil
Vários cordão, por isso querem meu pescoço
Até com bigodin fininho eu sou bigode grosso
Eu sou persuasivo, meu amor 
Posso vender milagres à um pastor
Enganar um impostor, rap
Não cobro cachê, é só o imposto, tipo alguém que te salvou

Guarde meu lugar na mesa
Guarde meu nome na história
Guarde meu nome na memória
Guarde meu nome na memória

Guarde meu lugar na mesa
Me veja fazendo história
Guarde meu nome na memória
Guarde meu nome na memória

Brabo na porrada igual Charles do Bronx 
Tirei o pino da granada 
Traficante, mas no caso eu passo visões 
Tudo palmeado 
Vai passar nada 
Uma casa em cada canto 
Uma conta em cada banco 
Um linha de frente em cada bando 
Eu que mando 
Vem de mancada eu te bando 
A cara do crime 
A vida de filme 
Orgulho do gueto 
Em todos sentido nós te pega firme 
Nós passa, elas grita “ai, preto” 
É que eu tenho sono leve
Tô aqui até que Deus me leve 
Bilionário num futuro breve 
Nem bebo e faço mais grana que a Ambev 
Ousado 
Compro nada que é usado 
O que eu acho engraçado é que a mesma que joga dizia que eu era zoado 
Na pista não dá pra pegar 
Coleção de carro importado 
L7 aluno do BK
Os dois mais brabos do mercado

Guarde meu lugar na mesa
Guarde meu nome na história
Guarde meu nome na memória
Guarde meu nome na memória

Guarde meu lugar na mesa
Me veja fazendo história
Guarde meu nome na memória
Guarde meu nome na memória

__________________________________________________________________

LETRA: 

Não leu a receita do remédio
Isso não funciona com genérico
E tu atrás desses cara, é sério?
Não vê que isso aqui é um império
Acho que tu precisa de um médico

Sem promessas, tu só vê quando acertou
Sem me explanar, eu sou um fuzil com silenciador
Marcando igual tatuagem, amém
Tipo cortesia pro baile, se arruma e só vem

Tipo sexo, quero ser o que mais marca
Foda-se quem foi o primeiro
Não perca tempo com amores que não arrepiam o pelo
E eles se acham quentes, tu sente mais calor até com gelo

Você vê quem é quem no meio da turbulência
Quem treme e quem não teme a consequência
Nem aí se é terra de ninguém
Eu não posso morrer sendo um ninguém

A história vai pra sempre ser lembrada
Seja com amor ou seja um trauma
seja pelo fogo ou pela calma
Seja pela dor ou pela falta
Isso até parece um romance
Por isso você sempre me dá uma última chance

Tenho que relaxar
Porque eu quero parar o que me desespera, eu sei
Mas não quero pensar quando eu quero parar 
Meu amor sentindo vários de você
É intenso sentir, deixando atravessar 
E depois ter que voltar ao meu lugar 
São memórias repetidas diferentes pra lembrar 
Que é gostoso deixar o corpo no ar

Quando eu me encontrei, numa culpa imensa
Não me controlei, nem li a receita

O amor ainda é a droga mais perigosa
O amor ainda é a droga mais saborosa
Faz até a dor sumir da gente
Atrás da superdosagem que vai deixar na onda pra sempre

Ela some no fim de semana
Só aparece na segunda
Faz o que quiser de mim
Só porque eu amo aquela bunda


Viu o que o amor é capaz de fazer
Com o ego e com o orgulho
Mesmo assim eu não nego o mergulho

Até damos atenção ao nosso nome 
Na boca dos recalcados
Também é uma forma de ser amado
Se fosse só pela grana, era outro corre, era outro papo
O mais rico inveja o mais amado

A gente ama essas ruas
A gente ama essas lutas
A gente ama esse ódio
Não é pelas medalhas, e sim pelo amor que queremos o pódio

Pique um político querendo seu voto
Um protagonista querendo ser o foco
Por isso os antigos revoltados com os mais novos
Com medo de perder o amor pro próximo
Por isso eu nunca me rendo nem fico de joelhos
Em nome do amor que eu sinto por mim mesmo

Sonho que nosso corpo, nosso desejo não vai se blindar 
Mas sim questionar o amor que me faz sustentar todo o silêncio pra estremecer.   
Desapegados mas sem esquecer do que limita meu movimento 
Hoje desbravo novos acalentos já não me importa o quanto é intenso
Sei que tudo é calor do momento por toda lembrança que não me controla 
Mas faz encontrar falhas dentro e fora das estruturas de poder amar  
Me leva todinha mas eu vou embora 
Me marque todinha mais cedo chega minha hora 
No corpo o amor parece livre e por dentro chora

Quando eu me encontrei, numa culpa imensa

Lyrics:

Y ahora sola está mejor
Esta hookiada y me anda buscando
Ready pa buscarse un par de líos
Solo sale de noche tarde en la noche
No va mas con ese malparido (x2)

Ella se pasa bien low cansada de su getto
janguiando y jodiendo
Y las fotos subiendo
Cuando con ella prendo
Todo fluye natural
De la nota te dejas llevar
Esta pa salir no esta pa dormir
En la disco a mil
Mas de diez refill
Puesta pa la vuelta puesta pa el jangueo
Corona a su Joseo
De la noche al terror
A vapor no le doy Dior pero le doy calor
Tequila sin hielo le eleva el vigor
Solo pasajero no estamos en amor
Una ma’ y me voy
Firma la vuelta hoy

Y ahora sola está mejor
Esta hookiada y me anda buscando
Ready pa buscarse un par de líos
Solo sale de noche tarde en la noche
No va mas con ese malparido (x2)

Como yo nadie la pone
Traviesa cuando se toma los rones
Pa fumar cripy
Para chingar los condones
De memoria hacemos todas las posiciones

Yo te hablo real no te tiro labia
Ya cerre la disco pa que me caigas
Se te cae la ropa cuando me bailas
Ya esta amaneciendo pero no te vayas

Bb esta noche es especial
Tu no la vas a olvidar
Te voy a hacer mi yal
Mañana no sera igual

Y ahora sola está mejor
Esta hookiada y me anda buscando
Ready pa buscarse un par de líos
Solo sale de noche tarde en la noche
No va mas con ese malparido (x2)

If I was to tell you that the hell you’re living in's a starter
What it takes to survive with a wonderful life is harder
What do you get when you place all your bets outside you?
If you’re holding your breath it’s no wonder it’s yet to find you 

Talk about it but you never ever want to think about it 
Keep talking but you’re never gonna find a way to make it fit 
Watch as the world does a twist and a twirl without you 
You can’t make any sense when you’re building a fence around you

Take back your wonderful life 
The more the life to love much better
We say it all of the time, the time is now
It’s now or never 

We all get it wrong  
So don't stay mad for long 
Or it’s a lonely little life
Lonely little lifetime 

But its a sin that I can’t 
Understand what you meant 
And I’m sorry that I can’t get through

But if we choose to forget
What we’ve come to regret
Oh, if we only knew 

Take back your wonderful life 
The more the life to love much better
We say it all of the time, the time is now
It’s now or never 

We all get it wrong  
So don’t stay mad for long 
Or its a lonely little life
Lonely little lifetime 

Take back your wonderful life 
The more the life to love much better
We say it all of the time, the time is now
It’s now or never 

We all get it wrong  
So don’t stay mad for long 
Or its a lonely little life
Lonely little lifetime

Lyrics:
Shake your money, Shake your money, Shake your moneymaker
Shake your money, Shake your money, Shake your moneymaker

Oh me, oh my my
You getting yours, baby I get mine
Little cray-zy, is what I like
Never seen a party that’s a waste of time (Ooooh)

We running running, yea, we’re running the show (Oooooh)
We started something, yea we’re ready to go 

Hit the lights, shut it down 
Getting lost, in the crowd
Lose your mind, set it free
If it feels good, feel it yea follow my lead

Shake your money, Shake your money, Shake your moneymaker
Shake your money, Shake your money, Shake your moneymaker
Do it how you do it go and get your paper
Shake your money, Shake your money, Shake your moneymaker

We running running, now we’re running the show
We started something, Yea, we’re ready to go
We’re spinning around til it’s out of control 
We’re going wild and we ain’t going home 

To the left (if you’re blessed) 
To the right (alright) 
Pick it up (shake it fast) 
Like you’re in the spotlight
Oh, me, oh my, my 
You’ve been getting yours, I be getting mine 

Shake your money, Shake your money, Shake your moneymaker
Shake your money, Shake your money, Shake your moneymaker
Do it how you do it go and get your paper
Shake your money, Shake your money, Shake your moneymaker

Shake your money, Shake your money, Shake your moneymaker
Shake your money, Shake your money, Shake your moneymaker
Do it how you do it go and get your paper
Shake your money, Shake your money, Shake your moneymaker

Hit the lights, shut it down 
Getting lost, in the crowd
Lose your mind, set it free
If it feels good, feel it yea follow my lead

Shake your money, Shake your money, Shake your moneymaker
Shake your money, Shake your money, Shake your moneymaker
Do it how you do it go and get your paper
Shake your money, Shake your money, Shake your moneymaker

Shake your money, Shake your money, Shake your moneymaker
Shake your money, Shake your money, Shake your moneymaker
Do it how you do it go and get your paper

►Lyrics:

Terliğim Suicoke
Seninkiyse Gezer
Ouzo senin maaşını bi’ saatte ezer
Bahsettiğim şey değil BKM
Ama hatunun götü kocaman sanki bi’ eser

Bebek gibi hatun gelir Bebek’ten
Madem bebeksin hadi emeklen
Dedim ona “hadi gel bana kenetlen”
Akülü araç gibi kolay onu yönetmem

Aga içmeyeceksin yaramıyorsa
İki yudum alıp koltuğa bayılıyorsan
Numaralar değişiyor çünkü ayıkıyorlar
Biz Mersin’de agalara dayı diyo’z ha

Anahtarsız Benz push start
Senin ortamda çok puşt var
Ama benim ortamda çok kuş var
Üstelik değil ötenlerden
Tanıdıklar var beynini dökenlerden

Seni sığır boynumdaki gümüş değil altın
Seni sığır bileğimdeki gümüş değil altın
Seni sığır boynumdaki gümüş değil altın
Seni sığır bileğimdeki gümüş değil altın

Ehliyetim yok
Arabayı edemedim park
Mercedes’im büyük onu edemedim park
Dün adamıma ödemedim bak
Ama “no problem bro” dedi
Çünkü ben onun en iyi müşterisiyim

Dedi “Ouzo şeker” no insülin
Kırk beş yaşında milf CHP’li Tülin
Dedi bana “kazağını ver de ütüleyeyim”
Ama dedim ona “Bu designer yani Raf Simons’ıma dokunma”

Herkes soruyor “ner’den buluyorsun”
İyi dinle şimdi vereceğim tarifini
…
Sence verir miyim tarifini?

Feru yapıştırıyor kullanmadan tutkal
Kafamızı yaşarız aga sen bi’ sussan
Herkes bunlara alışık burada

Ehliyetsiz arabada amcalarla saklambaç
Forever young bana yakışmıyor yaşlanmak
Sar bi’ tane bizimkiler ister haşlanmak
Baby harbi burada tek opsiyonun paslanmak

Biraz Polat biraz Borat shawty jagshemash
Kaşı beyaz masam dolu yanda manitas
Deplasman her yerdeyiz on them haritas
Gencim sıkar sana aldı benden talimat

Teli sessiz arama
Fransa düştüm şaraba
Used to live like maraba
Şimdi oldum ağa artık pull up yeni saraya
Goofy geldik sen de soktun abileri araya

Pussy! Seni tükürüp de süpürürler
Burada yürüyemez ama onu yürütürler
Shawty yapışma çağırayım sana bi’ Uber
Goofy bitch şu şeklini bi’ düzelt

LYRICS
Give me a second I,
I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking bout a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a glass
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight

The moon is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home tonight

LYRICS
Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off

But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for oh
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore...
oh woah, oh woah, oh woah oh oh
oh woah, oh woah, oh woah oh oh

This is it, boys, this is war - what are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype - save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked, but here they come again to jack my style

And that's alright; I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am
Oh, who am I? Oh, who am I? mmm... mmm...

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win, I always win...

But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know... (come on)

So this is it? I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?

No. When I see stars, when I see, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like this one, so come on
Oh, come on. Oh, come on, OH COME ON!

Well, this is it guys, that is all - five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home; Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she call ""love""
But when I look into my nephew's eyes...
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from...
Some terrible nights...ahhh...

oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh
oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh

The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance... oh...
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance... oh...

LYRICS
Well I woke up to the sound of silence 
The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight 
And I found you with a bottle of wine 
Your head in the curtains 
And heart like the Fourth of July 

You swore and said 
We are not 
We are not shining stars 
This I know 
I never said we are 

Though I've never been through hell like that 
I've closed enough windows 
To know you can never look back 

If you're lost and alone 
Or you're sinking like a stone 
Carry on 
May your past be the sound 
Of your feet upon the ground 
Carry on 

Carry on, carry on 

So I met up with some friends 
At the edge of the night 
At a bar off 75 
And we talked and talked 
About how our parents will die 
All our neighbours and wives 

But I like to think 
I can cheat it all 
To make up for the times I've been cheated on 
And it's nice to know 
When I was left for dead 
I was found and now I don't roam these streets 
I am not the ghost you want of me 

If you're lost and alone 
Or you're sinking like a stone 
Carry on 
May your past be the sound 
Of your feet upon the ground 
Carry on 

Woah 
My head is on fire 
But my legs are fine 
Cause after all they are mine 
Lay your clothes down on the floor 
Close the door 
Hold the phone 
Show me how 
No one's ever gonna stop us now 

Cause we are 
We are shining stars 
We are invincible 
We are who we are 
On our darkest day 
When we're miles away 
So we'll come 
We will find our way home 

If you're lost and alone 
Or you're sinking like a stone 
Carry on 
May your past be the sound 
Of your feet upon the ground 
Carry on 

Carry on, carry on

LYRICS
It's getting late, and I
Cannot seem to find my way home tonight
Feels like I am falling down a rabbit hole
Falling for forever, wonderfully wandering alone
What would my head be like
If not for my shoulders
Or without your smile
May it follow you forever
May it never leave you
To sleep in the stone,
May we stay lost on our way home
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities
If I should die tonight
May I first just say I'm sorry
For I, never felt like anybody
I am a man of many hats although I
Never mastered anything
When I am ten feet tall
I've never felt much smaller, since the fall
Nobody seems to know my name
So don't leave me to sleep all alone
May we stay lost on our way home?
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities
Try not to mistake what you have with what you hate
It could leave, it could leave, come the morning
Celebrate the night
It's the fall before the climb
Shall we sing, shall we sing, 'til the morning
If I fall forward, you fall flat
And if the sun should lift me up
Would you come back? C'mon!
So c'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities
It's getting late and I, cannot seem to find my way home tonight.",False,False,,Not Found

LYRICS
For once there is nothing up my sleeve
Just some scars from a life that used to trouble me
I used to run at first sight of the sun
Now I lay here waiting for you to wake up

The city outside still sounds like it's on fire
You put on new sheets, the white flag of a Saturday night
I know we stayed up talking in circles
But I like to think the symmetry will keep me close to you

For everyone, I'm out to prove wrong, you keep the light on
The only one, you know me better than the truth
So, despite what I've done, I pray to God that we can move on
'Cause thus far you are the best thing that this life has yet to lose

And for once there is nothing up my sleeve
Just some scars from a life that used to trouble me
I used to run at first sight of the sun
Now I lay here waiting for you to wake up
I lay here waiting for you to wake up

So if you gonna leave, if you gonna go
I can't bare to sleep without you in my arms
I know we got caught up sifting through a crowd of pebbles and lures
But you must not let them take you
They don't know you like I do

For once there is nothing up my sleeve
Just some scars from a life that used to trouble me
I used to run at first sight of the sun
Now I lay here waiting for you to wake up
I lay here waiting for you to wake up

Do you remember when we stayed up till the sun strikes through the room
I used to blame it on the Queen's Walk in down 7th avenue
It's been years now since we moved
I gotten good at an excuse
You know I try not to speak superlatives
But it's impossible to you

The city outside is nothing but a flicker now
You see our friends to bed, you turn out the lights
I start to think you'll make a beautiful mother I,
I like to think I have everything I want from this life",True,True,27697921.0,Not Found

LYRICS
 Slow down,
 we've got time left to be lazy
 All the kids have bloomed from babies into flowers in our eyes.
 We've got 50 good years left to spend out in the garden
 I don't care to beg your pardon,
 We should live until we die.

 We were barely 18 when we'd crossed collective hearts.
 It was cold, but it got warm when you'd barely crossed my eye.
 and then you turned, put out your hand,
 and you asked me to dance.
 I knew nothing of romance, but it was love at second sight.

 I swear when I grow up, I won't just buy you a rose.
 I will buy the flower shop, and you will never be lonely.
 Even if the sun stops waking up over the fields
 I will not leave, I will not leave 'til it's our time.
 So just take my hand, you know that I will never leave your side.

 It was the winter of '86, and all the fields had frozen over.
 So we moved to Arizona to save our only son
 and now he's turning to a man, although he thinks just like his mother,
 he believes we're all just lovers he sees hope in everyone.

 And even though she moved away,
 we always get calls from our daughter.
 She has eyes just like her father's
 they are blue when skies are grey.
 And just like him, she never stops,
 Never takes the day for granted,
 works for everything that's handed to her,
 Never once complains.

 You think that I nearly lost you
 When the doctors tried to take you away.
 But like the night you took my hand beside the fire
 30 years ago to this day
 You swore you'd be here 'til we decide that it's our time
 Well it's not time, you've never quit in all your life.
 So just take my hand, you know that I'll never leave your side.
 You're the love of my life, you know that I'll never leave your side.

 You come home from work and you kiss me on the eye
 You curse the dogs and say that I should never feed them what is ours
 So we move out to the garden, look at everything we've grown
 and the kids are coming home
 I'll set the table
 You can make the fire.",True,True,21126642.0,baroque pop

""All The Pretty Girls"" Lyrics:
So I call your name, cross my fingers
uncross the others, hesitate.
Oh,I don't think straight with nothing to prove.

I don't wanna say I'm leaving
I will stay until the weekend.
And you can take all your things;
the boxes and rings
and get going.

'Cause I've been waiting for...

All the pretty girls on a Saturday night.
Let it be, and come to me with the look in your eyes.
Well you break and take all the words from my mouth.
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down.

So I call(I call) you out(out baby)
Just to feel a little bit better about myself(he does)
And I do(you do), baby I do
'Til their lips start to move,
and their friends talk music
I say ""I've never heard the tune!""
But I have, I just hate the band
'cause they remind me of you.

Every single night ends up the same,
I don't say much at all, but I bring up your name.
(Over and over and over)
I think it's striking me out.

All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
Let it be, and come to me with the look in your eyes.
Well you break and take all the words from my mouth.
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down.
But not you,
you still wear boots and your hair is too long
and then this one doesn't want to admit she's fallen in love
Oh c'mon, oh c'mon, what's a boy to do
When all the pretty girls can't measure to you?

I don't understand your reasons
Please just stay over the weekend
You can't take all those things
They define you and me
everything we've become,
You're all that I need
Please don't make me face my generation alone.

All the pretty girls on a Saturday night.
Let it be, oh come to me with the look in your eyes.
And you break and take all the words from my mouth?
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down.
But not you,
I feel your faith is destroying the world
and then this one never really understood
the 80s is over and done
Oh c'mon, what's a boy to do,
when all the pretty girls can't measure to you? Subscribe to Nettwerk's YouTube channel:

LYRICS
I've got enough on my mind
That when she pulls me by the hair
She hasn't much to hold onto
She's keeping count on her hand
One, two, three days that I've been
Sleeping on my side

I finished kissing my death
So now I head back up the steps
Thinking about where I've been
I mean the sun was never like this
I want to feel with the seasons
I guess it makes sense
Cause my life's become as vapid as
A night out in Los Angeles
And I just want to stay in bed

And hold you like I used to
You know that I am home
So darling if you love me
Would you let me know?

Or go on, go on, go on
If you are thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
For once, for once, for once
I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?

She got enough on her mind
That she feel no sorrow
I let my fate fill the air
So now she's rolling down the window
Never been on to hold on
But I need a last grasp
So I ask if she remembers when
She used to come and visit man
We were fools to think that nothing could go wrong

Go on, go on, go on
If you're thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
For once, for once, for once
I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
I think I kinda like it
But I might have had too much

I'll move back down
To this western town
When they find me out
Make no mistake about it

Go on, go on, go on
If you are thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?

For once, for once, for once
I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
I think I kinda like it
But I might have had too much

I'll move back down

So you feel entitled to a sense of control

We are the fire, we see how they run
See how they run, lift me higher

And once I hear them clearly, say

Who, who are you really?
And where are you going?
Well I've got nothing left to prove
Cause I've got nothing left to lose
See me bare my teeth for you

You were there.  You were tearing up everything.

We all know what we've done.

Killer.

Silver tigers in the moonlight running
And the wind in the trees
Singing ""Do you believe?""

And now we know it's gone.
 
We must be killers,

Killers.
Where we got left to run?

LYRICS:

FEELS LIKE THE END   
Closing up shop and locking doors
Turning up lost in some unknown
""Don't wait...,"" you say.
You say ""...they've gone home.""
Sleep with the lights off when you're alone.

Silence so mighty you go deaf;
bombs are going off inside your chest.
I know you wanted to be loved,
but you're bleeding left alone... so, so, so alone...
singing where does time go from here?

It feels like the end
It feels like the end

Darkness swallows a dying star.
Makes no difference what you're running from.
The voices follow you
voices follow you
voices follow you into the dark...
singing where does time go from here?

It feels like the end
It feels like the end.",False,False,4884485.0,pop music

Sepanjang Hidup - Lyrics:

Sepanjang Hidup
aku bersyukur kau di sini kasih
di kalbuku mengiringi
dan padamu ingin ku sampaikan
kau cahaya hati
dulu ku palingkan diri dari cinta
hingga kau hadir membasuh segalanya
oh inilah janjiku kepadamu

sepanjang hidup bersamamu
kesetiaanku tulus untukmu
hingga akhir waktu kaulah cintaku cintaku
sepanjang hidup seiring waktu
aku bersyukur atas hadirmu
kini dan selamanya aku milikmu
yakini hatiku 

kau anugerah Sang Maha Rahim
semoga Allah berkahi kita
kekasih penguat jiwaku
berdoa kau dan aku di Jannah
ku temukan kekuatanku di sisimu
kau hadir sempurnakan seluruh hidupku
oh inilah janjiku kepadamu

sepanjang hidup bersamamu
kesetiaanku tulus untukmu
hingga akhir waktu kaulah cintaku cintaku
sepanjang hidup seiring waktu
aku bersyukur atas hadirmu
kini dan selamanya aku milikmu
yakini hatiku 

bersamamu ku sadari inilah cinta
tiada ragu dengarkanlah
kidung cintaku yang abadi

For the Rest of My Life - LYRICS

I praise Allah for sending me you my love
You've found your home it's here with me, and I'm here with you 
Now let me let you know
You've opened my heart 
I was always thinking that love was wrong
But everything was changed when you came along, oh
And there's a couple of words I want to say

Chorus:
For the rest of my life, I'll be with you
I'll stay by your side, honest and true
Till the end of my time, I'll be loving you, loving you
For the rest of my life, through days and nights 
I'll thank Allah for opening my eyes 
Now and forever I, I'll be there for you
I know it deep in my heart 

I feel so blessed when I think of you
And I ask Allah to bless all we do
You're my wife, and my friend and my strength
And I pray we're together in Jannah
Finally now I've found my self, I feel so strong 
Yes everything was changed when you came along, oh
And there's a couple of words I want to say

Chorus 

And now that you're here, in front of me
I strongly feel love
And I have no doubt, and I'll sing it loud
And that I will love you eternally

Chorus

Baraka Allahu Lakuma - Lyrics:

We're here on this special day
Our hearts are full of pleasure
A day that brings the two of you
Close together

We're gathered here to celebrate
A moment you'll always treasure
Let's ask Allah to make your love
Last forever

Chorus:
Let's raise our hands
And make du'a
Like the Prophet taught us
And with one voice let's all say
Baraka Allahu lakuma
Wa baraka 'alaykuma
Wa jama'a baynakuma
Fi khayr
(May Allah bless everything for you two
And shower His blessings upon the two of you
And may he bring you together 
In everything that is good)

From now you'll share all your joys
Through hardship support each other
Together worshipping Allah
Seeking His pleasure 

We pray that He will fill your life
With happiness and blessings 
And grant you kids who'll make your home
Filled with laughter

Chorus

Allah barik lahuma
Allah adim hobbahuma
Allah salli wa sallim
'Ala Rasooli Allah
(Allah, bless everything the two of them
Allah, make their love last for ever
Allah, send peace and blessings
Upon the Messenger of Allah)

Allah toub 'alayna
Allah irdha 'anna
Allah ihdi khutana
'Aala sunnat Nabina
(Allah, accept our repentance
Allah, be pleased with us
Allah, guide our footsteps
Along the path of our Prophet)

كلمات أغنية يا نبي سلام عليك:

أنت نور الله فجراً
جئت بعد العسر يسراً
ربنا أعلاك قدراً
يا إمام الانبياء
أنت في الوجدان حيٌ
أنت للعينين ضيٌ
أنت عند الحوض ريٌ
أنت هاد وصفيٌ
يا حبيبي يا محمد

يا نبي سلام عليك
يا رسول سلام عليك
يا حبيب سلام عليك
صلوات الله عليك

يرتوي بالحب قلبي
حب خير رسل ربي
من به أبصرت دربي
يا شفيعي يا رسول الله

أيها المختار فينا
زادنا الحب حنيناً
جئتنا بالخير ديناً
يا ختام المرسلين
يا حبيبي يا مُحمد

يا نبي سلام عليك
يا رسول سلام عليك
يا حبيب سلام عليك
صلوات الله عليك

""Allahi Allah Kiya Karo"" Lyrics:

Chorus:
Allahi Allah kiya karo
Dukh na kisee ko diya karo
Joh duniya ka malik hai
Nam usee ka liya karo
Allahi Allah
(Say always in remembrance Allah O Allah
Do not give anyone sorrow or despair
For He is the sovereign king of the whole world
Take only His name
Allah O Allah)

Just like a sunrise
Can't be denied no
Just like the river
Will find the sea
O Allah, you're here
And You're always near
And I know without a doubt 
That You always hear my prayer

Chorus

So many bright stars
Like diamonds in the sky, Oh
It makes me wonder 
How anyone can be blind
To all the signs so clear
Just open your eyes
And I know without a doubt
You will surely see the light
Theri hi dunya                              
Theri zameen
Yeh kahekashan hai
Thu hai Karim
Mere....Maula
Sunle dhua
Hum bebas hain
There bina
Roshan kar jahan
(This is your world
This is your earth
This is your sky
You are generous
My Lord, hear my prayer
We are helpless without you
Illuminate the earth)

Ya Nabi Salam Alayka - Lyrics:

Gönüllärde hasretin var
Yüreklär ashkenla tcharpar 
Sensiz Dünya bizlere dar
Seelam sana Ey kotlu yar 
(Our souls long for you
Our hearts beat with your love
This world without you is unbearable for us
Peace and blessings upon you O Prophet)

With submission, faith and patience 
You conveyed the noble ""message""
Brought us light through your guidance 
Peace be upon you my beloved  
Ya habibi ya Muhammad 
(Muhammad O my beloved)

Chorus:
Ya Nabi salam 'alayka
Ya Rasool salam 'alayka
Ya Habib salam 'alayka
Salawatu Allah 'alayka
(O Prophet peace and blessings be upon you
O Messenger peace and blessings be upon you
O Beloved peace and blessings be upon you
May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon you)

Teri mohabbat kee mehek se
Yeah zameeno asma abadh hain
Rehmat kee barsat aati hain
Dillo jaan ya rasoola Allah
(By the fragrance of your love
The earth and sky reside
You're a monsoon of mercy
Beloved of my heart O Messenger of Allah)

Ayyuhal mukhtaru feena
Zaadanal hubbu haneena
Ji'tana bil khayri deena
Ya khitaamal mursaleena
Ya Habibi ya Muhammad
(O you who was chosen from amongst us
Our love has increased our longing for you
You came to us with everything good embodied in a religion
O Seal of all messengers
Muhammad O my beloved)

""Peace Be Upon You"" Lyrics:

There’s faith in my world
It comes back to your teachings and all your words
From your life I have learnt
To be patient and caring at every turn
The reason I’m strong
You’re where I belong
In a world spinning out of control
The reason for my pride
You are my guide
And I will always follow your way
Your way, your way, oh!

Chorus:
‘Alayka salla Allah O Muhammad
(May Allah’s salutations be upon you O Muhammad)
Peace & blessings on you every day
‘Alayka salla Allah O Muhammad
You inspire me in every way
I promise that wherever I go
Whenever I pray
I’ll be sending you praise
With the words that I say
Rasulallah (Messenger of Allah), O Muhammad
Peace & blessings on you every day

There’s light in my heart
Helps me find my way back when I've gone too far
When all my anger makes me blind
I remember you’re a mercy for all mankind
The reason I forgive as long as I live
In a world spinning out of control
The reason I love, I'll never give up
And I will always follow your way
Your way, your way, oh!

I know the only thing I want from this life
And it’s to follow all your footsteps to Paradise
So that’s the way I’m going to spend all my time
Yes I swear, by Allah I swear!

Lyrics: 
Memories follow me left and right 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now 

ever since the da day y-you went away
no I don't know how 
how to erase your body from out my brain 
whatcha gon do now
maybe I should just focus on me instead
But all I think about 
are the nights we were tangled up in your bed

oh no (oh no)
oh no (oh no)
you’re going round in circles got you stuck up in my head (yeah)

Memories follow me left and right 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
your love stays with me day and night 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now

ever since the da da day y-you went away 
someone tell me how 
how much more do I gotta drink for the pain 
whatcha gon do now
you did things to me that I just can't forget 
now all I think about 
are the nights we were tangled up in your bed 
oh no (oh no)
oh no (oh no)
you're going round in circles got ya stuck up in my head 

Memories follow me left and right 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
your love stays with me day and night 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now

did ya know you’re the one that got away
and even now baby i'm still not ok 
did ya know that my dreams they're are the same 
everytime I close my eyes 

Memories follow me left and right 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now
your love stays with me day and night 
I can feel you over here i can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now

I can feel you over here I can feel you over here
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now

ABOUT BTS 
BTS, an acronym of Bangtan Sonyeondan or “Beyond the Scene,” is a GRAMMY-nominated South Korean group that has been capturing the hearts of millions of fans globally since its debut in June 2013. The members of BTS are RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook. Gaining recognition for their authentic and self-produced music, top-notch performances, and the way they interact with their fans, BTS has established themselves as 21st century pop icons breaking countless world records. While imparting a positive influence through activities such as the LOVE MYSELF campaign and the UN ‘Speak Yourself’ speech, the band has mobilised millions of fans across the world (named ARMY), collected five No.1 Billboard Hot 100 singles in less than a year, performed multiple sold-out stadium shows across the world, and was named TIME’s Entertainer of the Year 2020. BTS has been nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for the 63rd GRAMMY Awards and recognised with numerous prestigious awards like the Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards and MTV Video Music Awards.

Lyrics

[Zayn:]
Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showing off

[Liam:]
Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Harry:]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

[Louis:]
Chasing it tonight,
Doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop

[Niall:]
Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Harry:]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

[Zayn:]
Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost

[Harry (along all):]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you

Lyrics

You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up, to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful
So come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why, you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eye eye eyes
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful

Lyrics

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
Written on these walls are
The colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning now
I see us in the light upon a hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life, I'll take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you is like chasing the clouds
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm and time
Is frozen
The story of my life, I give her hope (give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broken inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life

Lyrics

She be my queen
Since we were sixteen
We want the same things
We dream the same dreams
Alright (alright)
I got it all
'Cause she is the one
Her mum calls me love
Her dad calls me son
Alright (alright)
I know, I know, I know for sure
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Na na na na na na (oh, yeah)
Na na na na na na (alright)
Na na na na na na
Na na, she belongs to me
Kisses like cream
Her walk is so mean
And every jaw drop
When she's in those jeans
Alright (alright)
I don't exist
If I don't have her
The sun doesn't shine
The world doesn't turn
Alright (alright)
But I know, I know, I know for sure
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Na na na na na na (oh, yeah)
Na na na na na na (alright)
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
She knows, she knows
That I never let her down before
She knows, she knows
That I'm never gonna let another take her love from me now
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her love away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Na na na na na na (oh, yeah, alright, yeah)

Lyrics

I've got fire for a heart
I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul
And baby, you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason

If I didn't have you, there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down


Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down

I've got fire for a heart
I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul
And baby, you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason

If I didn't have you, there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah

All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me

All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down

Lyrics

I might never be your knight in shining armor
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight
When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious (oh, yeah)
Girl, I hope you’re sure
What you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn’t do
Then baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can’t even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now
I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don’t mean that we can’t live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time
When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious (oh, yeah)
Girl, I hope you’re sure
What you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn’t do
baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can’t even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now
And if you like cameras flashing every time we go out
(Oh, yeah)
And if you're looking for someone to write your breakup songs about
Baby, I'm perfect
Baby, we're perfect
If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn’t do
Baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can’t even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

Lyrics

I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight
Like us? Did they ever fight
Like us?
You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between
You and I
Oh, you and I
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light
Like us, but they never tried
Like us
You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us (Two of us)
'Cause you and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between
You and I, you and I
Oh, you and I
Oh, you and I
We can make it if we try
You and I
Oh, you and I

Lyrics
[Harry:]
Maybe it's the way she walked (wow)
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and passed the guards (wow)
Just like she already owned it

[Zayn:]
I said, ""Can you give it back to me?""
She said, ""Never in your wildest dreams.""

[All:]
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes...

[Liam:]
Said her name was Georgia Rose (wow)
And her daddy was a dentist

[Harry:]
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it

[Niall:]
I said, ""Can I take you home with me?""
She said, ""Never in your wildest dreams.""

[All:]
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes...

[Louis:]
You know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me

(oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Zayn:]
You know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I hope you remember how we danced
How we danced
1, 2, 1, 2, 3

[All:]
How we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
(we danced, we danced, it goes something like, yeah)
Danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah

It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever

Lyrics: 
Memories follow me left and right 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now 

ever since the da day y-you went away
no I don't know how 
how to erase your body from out my brain 
whatcha gon do now
maybe I should just focus on me instead
But all I think about 
are the nights we were tangled up in your bed

oh no (oh no)
oh no (oh no)
you’re going round in circles got you stuck up in my head (yeah)

Memories follow me left and right 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
your love stays with me day and night 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now

ever since the da da day y-you went away 
someone tell me how 
how much more do I gotta drink for the pain 
whatcha gon do now
you did things to me that I just can't forget 
now all I think about 
are the nights we were tangled up in your bed 
oh no (oh no)
oh no (oh no)
you're going round in circles got ya stuck up in my head 

Memories follow me left and right 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
your love stays with me day and night 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now

did ya know you’re the one that got away
and even now baby i'm still not ok 
did ya know that my dreams they're are the same 
everytime I close my eyes 

Memories follow me left and right 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now
your love stays with me day and night 
I can feel you over here i can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now

I can feel you over here I can feel you over here
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now

Charlie Puth has proven to be one of industry’s most consistent hitmakers and sought-after collaborators. Puth has amassed eight multi-platinum singles, four GRAMMY nominations, three Billboard Music Awards, a Critic’s Choice Award, and a Golden Globe nomination. His 2018 GRAMMY-nominated LP, Voicenotes, was RIAA Certified Gold only four days after its release and has logged over 6 billion streams worldwide. Puth’s 2020 collaboration with Gabby Barrett on their “I Hope” Remix earned him his fourth top 10 track on the Billboard Hot 100, hit number one on the Billboard “Adult Pop Songs” chart, and won a 2021 Billboard Music Award for “Top Collaboration.” Puth also co-wrote and produced The Kid Laroi and Justin Bieber’s record-breaking single, “Stay,” which quickly become one of the biggest songs of 2021 and holds the title for the longest-reigning No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 chart and the first to lead it for double-digits - spending a total of eleven weeks at the top of the chart.

Lyrics:
Yeah, 
Why you callin’ at 11:30
When you only wanna do me dirty 
But I hit right back ‘cause you got that that, yeah 

Why you always wanna act like lovers 
But you never wanna be each other’s 
I say don’t look back but I go right back and

All the sudden I’m hypnotized 
You’re the one that I can’t deny 
Every time that I say I’m gonna walk away 

You turn me on like a light switch 
When your moving your body around and around
Now I don’t wanna fight this (No) 
You know how to just make me want you 
turn me on like a light switch 
When your moving your body around and around
You got me in a tight grip (Yeah)
You know how to just make me want you, baby 

Do you love it when you keep me guessing?
When you leave and then you leave me stressing?
But I cant stay mad when you walk like that, no

Why you always wanna act like lovers 
But you never wanna be each other’s
I say don’t look back but I go right back and

All a sudden I’m hypnotized 
You’re the one that I can’t deny 
Every time that I say I’m gonna walk away 

You turn me on like a light switch 
When your movin’ your body around and around
No, I don’t wanna fight this (No) 
You know how to just make me want you 
You turn me on like a light switch (Switch) 
When your movin’ your body around and around
You got me in a tight grip (Grip)
You know how to just make me want you, baby 

C’mon, C’mon, C’mon, C’mon, C’mon and show me how you do (Do)
You want, you want, you want, you want, you want me to keep wantin’ you (wantin’ you girl)
C’mon, C’mon, C’mon, C’mon, C’mon and show me how you do (How you do)
You want, you want, you want, you want, you want me to keep wantin’ you

You turn me on like a light switch 
When your movin’ your body around and around
No, I don’t wanna fight this 
You know how to just make me want to 
You turn me on like a light switch 
When your movin’ your body around and around
You got me in a tight grip 
You know how to just make me want you, baby

Lyrics: 
It started with a kiss
On your momma’s couch
2012 was nothing serious
And then we caught the feels
It got really real
Too good to be true I guess I thought you was yeahhh

Why did I run away, run away, run away
Oh your love was everything, everything, everything
I know it’s getting late, getting late, getting late
But can I still be on my way, on my way, yeahhh

I know I said goodbye
And baby you said it too
But when I touch her I feel like I’m cheating on you
I thought that I’d be better when I found someone new
But when I touch her I feel like I’m cheating on you
Baby now
Oooo
Cheating on you
Baby now
Oooo
But when I touch her I feel like I’m cheating on you

Thought I could get you back
Any time of day
Shouldn’t have been so cocky
Shouldn’t have did you wrong (Oooo)
And now I miss you bad
Really really bad
Guess you don’t know what you got until it’s gone

Why did I run away, run away, run away (run away)
Oh your love was everything, everything, everything (everything)
I know it’s getting late, getting late, getting late (getting late)
But can I still be on my way, on my way, yeahhh

I know I said goodbye
And baby you said it too (you said it too baby)
But when I touch her I feel like I’m cheating on you (cheating on you)
I thought that I’d be better when I found someone new (Oooo)
But when I touch her I feel like I’m cheating on you
Baby now
Oooo
Cheating on you
Baby now
Oooo
But when I touch her I feel like I’m cheating on you

Baby no
There ain’t no lips like your lips
And nobody else feels like this
There’s no moving on I’ll admit
If you go away
Yeahhh

I know I said goodbye
And baby you said it too
But when I touch her I feel like I’m cheating on you (cheating on you)
I thought that I’d be better when I found someone new (found someone new)
But when I touch her I feel like I’m cheating on you (believe it baby)
Baby now
Oooo
Cheating on you
Baby now
Oooo
But when I touch her I feel like I’m cheating on you
You said goodbye
And you said goodbye

Lyrics: 
Look how all tables,
Look how all the tables have turned,
Guess you’re finally realizing how bad you messed it up
Girl you’re only making,
Girl you’re only making it worse,
When you call like you always do when you want someone

You took away a year,
of my fucking life and I can’t get it back no more
So when I see those tears,
Coming out your eyes I hope it’s me they're for

You didn’t love when you had me
But now you need me so badly
You can’t be serious
That’s hilarious
Thinking I would still want you
After the things you put me through
Yea You’re delirious
That’s hilarious
 
Now you put the blame in,
Now you put the blame in reverse,
Tryina make me feel guilty for everything you’ve done
You’re another lesson,
You’re just another lesson I learned
Don’t give your heart to a girl who still got a broken one

You took away a year,
of my fucking life & I can’t get it back no more
So when I see those tears,
Coming out your eyes I hope it’s me they’re for 

You didn’t love when you had me
But now you need me so badly
You can’t be serious
That’s hilarious
Thinking I would still want you
After the things you put me through
Yea You’re delirious
That’s hilarious
You didn’t love when you had me
But now you need me so badly
You can’t be serious (you can’t be serious)
That’s hilarious (that’s hilarious)
Thinking I would still want you
After the things you put me through
Yea You’re delirious (delirious)
That’s hilarious (that’s hilarious)

Lyrics:
Oh I’m such a loser
How’d I ever lose her
Oh maybe I must of been out of my mind
Now I’m a loser, why’d I have to lose her
I’ll never recover, I’ll never be fine ‘cause I

I just might get a little too drunk so I won’t think about us
Don’t think about what we could have been
And I stay up like three or four nights so I won’t dream about us
Wake up with no luck
I just can’t win

Should have seen it all along (ah)
She was one in a million (ah)
It hurts whenever someone says her name (someone says her name)
When we were going off and on (ah)
I guess I really played it wrong (ah)
I should have never let her slip away

Oh I’m such a loser
How’d I ever lose her
Oh maybe I must of been out of my mind
Now I’m a loser, why’d I have to lose her
I’ll never recover, I’ll never be fine ‘cause I

I just might been a little too gone when she needed somebody 
Up against her body (ooh) at 2am
Yeah and now I keep lying to myself when she’s just joking probably  
(she’s joking probably)
She’ll probably call me and we’ll be us again 

I should have seen it all along (ah)
She was one in a million (ah)
Now she’s in love and I’m in second place 
damn
Oh I’m such a loser
How’d I ever lose her (lose her)
Oh maybe I must of been out of my mind
Now I’m a loser, why’d I have to lose her
I’ll never recover, I’ll never be fine ‘cause I

Oh my my my my
Oh my my my my
Oh my my my my, I’m a loser
Oh my my my my
Oh my my my my
Oh my my my my, I’m a loser

Tell me God is real
Do you think about me still
Or am I living for nothing
Don’t know where it went wrong but I’ll just take the hint
It's gonna take some adjusting 

Oh I’m such a loser
How’d I ever lose her 
Oh maybe I must of been out of my mind
Now I’m a loser, why’d I have to lose her (I’ll never) 
I’ll never recover, I’ll never be fine ‘cause I

I’m a loser
Oh my my my my
Oh my my my my

Lyric:
Te avisei que ia ser uma vez 
Tu prometeu não se apaixonar 
E olha quem tá pedindo replay 
Se afogou no chá 

Uma hora dessa, tá me ligando 
Procurando, tá doidinho pra quebrar tua promessa 
Não tem juramento do dedinho que resista a uma sentada dessa 
Te avisei pra não brincar

Eu quero ver tu esquecer depois do chá que eu te dei 
Ai papai, macetei 
Foi um tal de vuco vuco, tá maluco, quer replay 
Ai papai, Macetei (2X)

Macetada, toma (3X)
Macetei

Macetei

ENVOLVER 

Dime cómo hacemos
Si tú me deseas y yo a ti también
Hace rato te quiero comer
Dí qué vas a hacer
Así que ponme un dembow
Que ese no respeta
Y tengo pa’ ti la combi completa
Que, no duro mucha soltera
Aprovéchame

Y no te voy a envolver
Sé que lo hacemos y tú vas a volver
Un perreito trala pared
Yo soy un caso que hay que resolver
Pero no te voy a envolver
Sé que lo hacemos y tu vas a volver
Un perreito pa’ bellaquear
Pegaito a la pared

Botelleo’ y fumeteo’
Contigo en un capsuleo
Porque siempre que te veo
Tú me quieres perrear
Y yo quiero partirte
Cogelo a chiste
Y en cinco minutos ya vas a venirte
Me tienes como pa’ derretirte
Solo Dios sabes lo que me hiciste
Cogelo a chiste
Y en cinco minutos ya vas a venirte
Me tienes como pa’ derretirte
Solo Dios sabes lo que me hiciste

Y no te voy a envolver
Sé que lo hacemos y tú vas a volver
Un perreito en la pared
Yo soy un caso que hay que resolver
Pero no te voy a envolver
Sé que lo hacemos y tu vas a volver
Un perreito pa’ bellaquear
Pegaito a la pared

Sexo y alcohol
Lo que pase aquí se va quedar
Yo sé que no me vas a olvidar
Si te hago el amor, si te hago el amor
Sexo y alcohol
Lo que pase aquí se va quedar
Yo sé que no me vas a olvidar
Si te hago el amor, si te hago el amor

Y no te voy a envolver
Sé que lo hacemos y tú vas a volver
Un perreito en la pared
Yo soy un caso que hay que resolver
Pero no te voy a envolver
Sé que lo hacemos y tu vas a volver
Un perreito pa’ bellaquear
Pegaito a la pared

Letra:
Un poquitito, un poquitito te podés emborrachar
Dos copas de vino

Tamo' hablando de voltaje
Hoy estamos sudando todo el maquillaje
Me tenes volando alto sin pasaje
La que esta contigo no quiere que baje

Pero hoy vine con cinco amigas, mira lo que traje
Esto ahora parece nuestra pasarela
Pasa una, pasa' dos, están bien bellas
Si se va la luz, bebe, prendé la vela

Porque hoy no la bajamo', estamo' armando un alboroto
Aquí somo' puro corazones roto'
Lo que diga la gente a mi me importa poco
Esta noche parece que pecamo'

Mañana nos confesamo'
El bebé conmigo se ganó la loto
Me quiero hacer la mala poquito a poco
Esta noche parece que pecamo'

Mañana nos confesamo' (Mañana, mañana)
Mañana nos confesamo' (Mañana, mañana)
Ay, que rico la pasamo' (Mañana)
Y esta noche parece que pescamo' (Anitta)

Hoy yo vengo por lo mío (Mío)
Vuelo directo de Miami para Rio (Rio)
Haciendo que lo baile [?] el cazerío (-río)
Me trae a Tini, vamo' a armar tremendo lio

Deja que le suba y baje, lo único que yo te pido (Pido)
Le gusta darle duro contra la pared (Pared)
Diamante brillando 'e la cabeza a los pies (Pies)
Y el es de los míos, se ganó la loto (Loto)

Porque hoy no le bajamo', estamo' armando un alboroto
Aquí somo' puro corazones roto'
Lo que diga la gente me importa poco
Esta noche parece que pecamo' (Woo, woo)

Mañana nos confesamo' (hey)
El bebé conmigo se ganó la loto (hey)
Me quiero hacer la mala poquito a poco (hey)
Esta noche parece que pecamo'

Mañana nos confesamo' (Mañana, mañana)
Mañana nos confesamo' (Mañana, mañana)
Ay, que rico la pasamo' (Mañana)
Y esta noche parece que pecamo'
 
Estamos activas las nenas de Paris, con un flow safari
El bebe sí contesta cuando llama Becky G
Tenemo' to' el drip, drip, todo de Gucci-cci
Te tengo emboba'o como Lele a Guaynabichy

Vestidito corto, sin nada debajo, eh
Pa' esto es que trabajo
Tenemos el honey, expensive, caro
Estoy con la mía y el resto pa'l carajo

Tú sí, tú sí, tú sí quiere', yo tengo, bebé quiere'
Pa' que va a pedir permiso, si, también, pero se puede
Conmigo bendecido, esto no sale 'e la' parede'
Tú sí, tú sí, tú sí quiere', tú sí, tú sí, tú sí quiere' hoy

Estamo' armando un alboroto

Lyrics:
En su cuerpo puedo ver la definición

Se ve que lo trabaja eres motivación
Le pedi que me ayude con una mission
Que me llena entera de satisfacción

A mi me gusta cuando baja Downtown
Le pido que se quede ahi enviciado
Me dice baby sueno interesado
Si quieres ven y quédate otro round

A ella le gusta cuando bajo Downtown
Me pide que me quede ahi enviciado
Le digo baby estoy interesado
Si quieres yo quédo otro round

Que me quede otro round
tanto que me a rogado
Ya lo tengo oficiado
Yo te observado
No aguanta se adapta me dice
No quiero que termines
Es un misterio pero no de cine
En la noche soy yo la que define
Todo lo que va a pasar
a mi no me tienes que mandar

A mi me gusta cuando baja Downtown
Le pido que se quede ahi enviciado
Me dice baby sueno interesado
Si quieres ven y quédate otro round

A ella le gusta cuando bajo Downtown
Me pide que me quede ahi enviciado
Le digo mami estoy interesado
Si quieres yo quédo otro round

Uh se que me quieres ver
Bajando por toda tu piel
Uh se que quieres que me quede
Enredarte en mis piernas es lo que quieres 

No se vale el empate, esto es hasta darle jaque mate
Hasta que uno de los dos se mate
Si quieres yo bajo y de una me pongo pal' trabajo
Suelta el estrés, baby, yo te relajo
Se pone bella, me dice que ya
Sigue ahí, que la tengo viendo las estrellas
Se me acelera, hasta abajo se va
Y como ella lo hace, no lo hace cualquiera
En su cuerpo puedo ver la definición
Se ve que lo trabaja eres motivación
Le pedi que me ayude con una mission
Que me llena entera de satisfacción

A mi me gusta cuando baja Downtown
Le pido que se quede ahi enviciado
Me dice baby sueno interesado
Si quieres ven y quédate otro round

DEPOIS DO SHOW A TROPA TE ACIONA
PROIBIDONA, PROIBIDONA 
DENTRO DA VAN SÓ AS MAIS SAFADONA 

[GG]
EU TÔ PROIBIDONA
ELE SEMPRE ME ACIONA
QUER SABER SE EU VOU PRA ZONA 
EU VOU NO CARONA 
ELE CHORA E SE EMOCIONA 
NO MEU PORTE CAVALONA  
TODA GRANDONA  
EU SEMPRE VOLTO A TONA  
EU SIGO SENDO A FODONA 
TIPO A MADONNA  
EU NUNCA BEIJO A LONA 
SEMPRE AGUENTO A MARATONA 

[PRÉ REFRÃO - GG]
SE VOCÊ QUER, ENTÃO VEM PEGAR 
HOJE É PROIBIDO FALAR QUE NÃO DÁ 
PUXANDO O CABELO, APERTANDO O PESCOÇO 
DUVIDO QUE TU NÃO VAI SE APAIXONAR  
SE VOCÊ QUER, ENTÃO VEM PEGAR
JÁ BOLEI O JEITO, A HORA E O LUGAR 
VOCÊ JÁ BROTOU NA LOCALIZAÇÃO 
CALCINHA NO CHÃO 
[VALESCA]: POSSO FALAR?

[REFRÃO - ANITTA]

[PÓS-REFRÃO: VALESCA]
MEU NOME É VALESCA, EU DOU AULA DE PUTARIA

VAMBORA PRO BAILE! (PROIBIDONA)
TÔ PISCANDO! (PROIBIDONA)
SÓ PIRANHA NA NAVE! (PROIBIDONA)
VAI SENTANDO! (PROIBIDONA) 

[ANITTA]
ELE PARA PRA VER 
QUANDO A PATROA COMEÇA A DESCER  
TÔ DECOLANDO, FAZENDO DINHEIRO 
PELO MUNDO INTEIRO, ME VIU NA TV  
E ELE GOSTA ASSIM 
DE QUATRO DENTRO DO QUARTO 
TU FAZ CARA DE SAFADO 
DE LADO TE TACO TACO TACO TACO TACO

[PRÉ REFRÃO - GG & ANITTA]
SE VOCÊ QUER, ENTÃO VEM PEGAR 
HOJE EU TE FAÇO UM CONVITE 
TÔ DOIDA PRA TE CONTAR 
MAS O HORÁRIO NÃO PERMITE 
SE VOCÊ QUER, ENTÃO VEM PEGAR

EL QUE ESPERA - Anitta x Maluma

Tú sales con ella de la mano 
Y la veo
Tan nerviosa
Tu mirada es muy curiosa 
Cuando estas sobre mi 

Hace mucho tiempo lo intentamos 
Y no se dio bien la cosa 
Pero novia no es esposa 
Porque esto es para ti

Así así 
Porque el que espera
Se consigue lo que quiera

Así así 
Tamo' de acuerdo 
Puede pasar lo que sea 

Hoy por ti 
Después por mi 
Vamo’ allá 
Tamo aquí 

Hoy por ti 
Después por mi 
Vamo’ allá 
Tamo aquí 

Desde los tiempos disimulao’
El panty pal’ lao’
Yo tomando dos coronas bien arrebatao’
Muchos paparazzis por todos laos’
¿Recuerdas todo el cochineo en el lambo rentao’? 
Tranquila, mira cómo es la vida 
Hoy me tienes escribiendo 
“¿por que tan perdida?”
Y tranquila, respira y vacila
Que yo tenga novia nueva eso nada te quita 

Así así 
Porque el que espera
Se consigue lo que quiera

Así así 
Tamos de acuerdo 
Puede pasar lo que sea 

Hoy por ti 
Después por mi 
Vamo’ allá 
Tamo aquí 

Hoy por ti 
Después por mi 
Vamo’ allá 
Tamo aquí 

Espera un poco 
Más más 
Que yo te lo voy a dar 
Quiere ma' ma'
Pero ya ya

Ya sabemos todo lo que va a pasar  

Y no armes lío
Que yo tengo lo mío 
Y no es cuando tú quieras 
Sino cuando te digo 
Esperemos un año tal vez dos o cuatro
Pero por el momento felices los cuatro 

No me armes lío
Que yo tengo lo mío 
Y no es cuando tú quieras 
Sino cuando te digo 
Esperemos un año tal vez dos o cuatro
Pero en lo que llega 

Así así 
Porque el que espera
Se consigue lo que quiera

Así así 
Tamos’ de acuerdo 
Puede pasar lo que sea 

Hoy por ti 
Después por mi 
Vamo’ allá 
Tamo aquí 

Hoy por ti 
Después por mi 
Vamo’ allá 
Tamo aquí

Lyric:

Minha vida é uma obra de arte
Tinha que ser exposta num museu
No mundo tem poucas desse naipe
Quem passou aqui nunca esqueceu
Porque eu vou descendo, no talento 
Jogo a bunda devagar

Eu vou te macetar tá tá  
Te macetar 
Eu vou te macetar tá tá 
Te macetar 
Eu vou te maceta tá tá tá tá tá tá 
Tá tá 
Tá tá tá tá tá tá tá tá ta 

Eu vou te macetar
Faz com carinho 
Vai faz gostoso 
Gosta de se envolver com as faixa rosa do morro 

Faz com carinho 
Vai faz gostoso 
Gosta de se envolver com as faixa rosa do morro 

Tá tá tá tá tá tá tá tá ta 
Tá tá (2X)

Eu vou te macetar
Faz com carinho 
Vai faz gostoso 
Gosta de se envolver com as faixa rosa do morro

Faz com carinho 
Vai faz gostoso 
Gosta de se envolver com as faixa rosa do morro 

Tá tá tá tá tá tá tá tá ta 
Tá tá (2X)

Eu vou te macetar
Faz com carinho 
Vai faz gostoso 
Gosta de se envolver com as faixa rosa do morro

Faz com carinho 
Vai faz gostoso 
Gosta de se envolver com as faixa rosa do morro

Anitta y Justin Quiles mami
This is the remix

Te vi soltandote y bellaqueandome 
(oh eh oh eh oh eh) 
(oh eh oh eh oh eh)

Levante la mano si beben y fuman
Si la bellaquera sube como espuma
Si los sentimientos ahogaste en la laguna

Pero Pero Pero….


Ey no te voy a envolver 
Sé que lo hacemos y tú vas a volver
Un perreito en la pared
Yo soy un caso que hay que resolver

Pero no te voy a envolver
Sé que lo hacemos y tu vas a volver
Un perreito pa’ bellaquear 
Pegaito a la pared


Porque no me las facilitas
Mami yo soy un bellaco como Anitta
Ey, dice que sexo no necesita
Yo te quito el piquete de señorita

Los phillies rotando dentro de la disco
Mucho malianteo como en Jalisco
Tu les das hasta bajo y to’ el mundo gritándote

El gistro el gistro


Ando con mi hermana y está bien encendía
To’ los panas quieren darle una partía
Ese booty rebotando ella anda lucía
Si te come no te habla al otro día


Y no te voy a envolver…
Sé que lo hacemos y tú vas a volver
Un perreito en la pared
Yo soy un caso que hay que resolver


Mami yo me quiero envolver…
Si te pones fresca te voy a meter
Un perreito pa’ bellaquear
Pegaito a la pared



Sexo y alcohol 
Lo que pase aquí se va quedar
Yo sé que no me vas a olvidar
Si te hago el amor, si te hago el amor

Sexo y alcohol 
Lo que pase aquí se va quedar
Yo sé que no me vas a olvidar
Si te hago el amor, si te hago el amor


Y no te voy a envolver…
Si te pones fresca te voy a meter
Un perreito en la pared
Yo soy un caso que hay que resolver

Pero no te voy a envolver
Sé que lo hacemos y tú vas a volver
Un perreito pa’ bellaquear 
Pegaito a la pared

Botelleo’ y fumeteo’
Contigo en un capsuleo 
Porque siempre que te veo
Tú me quieres perrear 
Y yo quiero partirte


Botelleo’ y fumeteo’
Contigo en un capsuleo 
Porque siempre que te veo
Tú me quieres perrear 
Y yo quiero partirte

Te vi soltandote y bellaqueandome
(oh eh oh eh oh eh) 
(oh eh oh eh oh eh)

Formula Lyrics

E equals m c squared 
I’ve got a blip inside my head
Flew over the cuckoos nest
The Lights are on but there’s no one here 
 
Puffing with the dragons 
I’m living for the thrill formula 
 
(Screws loose)
On a Monday 
(Screws loose)
Wheres the propane
(Screws loose)
Tell ‘em 
 
(Screws loose)
Tell ‘em
(Screws Loose)
Tell ‘em 
I’m living for the thrill 
Formula
 
Tell ‘em
Puffing with the dragons
 
(Screws loose) 
Tell ‘em
I’m living for the thrill
