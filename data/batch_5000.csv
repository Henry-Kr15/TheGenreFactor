Letra

Liguei pro Papatinho perguntando se ele tinha uma batida pra mim, uma batida pra mim.
Como sempre, ele demorou a responder
Mas chegou uma mensagem falando “qualé neguinho, chega aê...e vamo ver qual vai ser”

É uma mistura de samba com rap
baile de favela com pagode e boombap
na medida pra fazer seu corpo todo mexer

Quando bate o grave ela desce gostoso
Toca na boate e ela pede de novo
Já falei que é disso que elas gostam e vou te explicar porquê

Final de semana
ela vai pra rua
Curtir um TrapSamba
balançando a lua
Seu corpo não é quadro, mas
eu quero ser moldura.
Vamos lá pra casa,
que hoje eu tô na tua.

Oi morena, que bom revê-la
Vêm com o papi mammy mammy 
Sob a luz das estrelas
Sem a nóia do holofote, ela dá o bote
Pede uns tapas, só de capa, ninguém quer filhote
Hmm, 
Sem energia nos postes
Brilha no escuro, energia no esporte
Tranquila na tequila, à vontade no shot
O pai de sensimilla à vontade de short
Ohh que delícia esse cheirinho no cangote
Solicitou a perícia ao perito, 
Ohh lord!
É offline que o bagulho fica louco
Ela vem e vai, eu quero tudo e mais um pouco
Hoje eu tô na sua baby, você tá na minha
Balançando a lua, acordando a vizinha
Cachorro late a gata mia, nem um pio
Shhhh!!!

Pretinha
Faço tudo pelo nosso amor
Faço tudo pelo bem de nosso bem (meu bem)
A saudade é minha dor
Que anda arrasando com meu coração
Não Duvide que um dia
Eu te darei o céu
Meu amor junto com um anel
Pra gente se casar
No cartório ou na igreja
Se você quiser
Se não quiser, tudo bem (meu bem)
Mas tente compreender
Morando em São Gonçalo você sabe como é
Hoje a tarde a ponte engarrafou
E eu fiquei a pé

Estava escangalhado

Lyrics:

Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her
And you know that she's half crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On Our Lady of the Harbour
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind",True,True,114623979.0,rock music

Lyrics:

If you are the dealer
I'm out of the game
If you are the healer
It means I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory then
Mine must be the shame
You want it darker
We kill the flame

Magnified, sanctified
Be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified
In the human frame
A million candles burning
For the help that never came
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my Lord

There's a lover in the story
But the story's still the same
There's a lullaby for suffering
And a paradox to blame
But it's written in the scriptures
And it's not some idle claim
You want it darker
We kill the flame

They're lining up the prisoners
And the guards are taking aim
I struggled with some demons
They were middle-class and tame
I didn't know I had permission
To murder and to maim
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my Lord

Magnified, sanctified
Be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified
In the human frame
A million candles burning
For the love that never came
You want it darker
We kill the flame

If you are the dealer
Let me out of the game
If you are the healer
I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory
Mine must be the shame
You want it darker

#LeonardCohen #DanceMeToTheEndOfLove


Lyrics:

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Oh dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the wedding now, oh dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Touch me with your naked hand, touch me with your glove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love",True,True,48887738.0,folk rock

Lyrics:

It's four in the morning, the end of December
I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening

I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
You're living for nothing now. I hope you're keeping some kind of record

Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear
Did you ever go clear?

Oh, the last time we saw you you looked so much older
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
You'd been to the station to meet every train
But then you came home without Lili Marlene

And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
And when she came back she was nobody's wife

I see you there with the rose in your teeth
One more thin gypsy thief
Well I see Jane's awake
She sends her regard

And what can I tell you my brother, my killer?
What can I possibly say?
I guess that I miss you. I guess I forgive you
I'm glad you stood in my way

If you ever come by here
For Jane or for me
Well, your enemy is sleeping
And his woman is free

Yes, and thanks for the trouble you took from her eyes
I thought it was there for good so I never tried

And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear

Lyrics:

I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm
Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm
Yes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new
In city and in forest they smiled like me and you
But now it's come to distances and both of us must try
Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye

I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time
Walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme
You know my love goes with you as your love stays with me
It's just the way it changes, like the shoreline and the sea
But let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie
Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye

I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm
Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm
Yes many loved before us, I know that we are not new
In city and in forest they smiled like me and you
But let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie
Your eyes are soft with sorrow

Lyrics:

Everybody knows that the dice are loaded
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
Everybody knows the war is over
Everybody knows the good guys lost
Everybody knows the fight was fixed
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich
That's how it goes
Everybody knows

Everybody knows that the boat is leaking
Everybody knows the captain lied
Everybody got this broken feeling
Like their father or their dog just died

Everybody talking to their pockets
Everybody wants a box of chocolates
And a long stem rose
Everybody knows

And everybody knows that you love me baby
Everybody knows that you really do
Everybody knows that you've been faithful
Ah give or take a night or two
Everybody knows you've been discreet
But there were so many people you just had to meet
Without your clothes
And everybody knows

Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows

Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows

And everybody knows that it's now or never
Everybody knows that it's me or you
And everybody knows that you live forever
Ah when you've done a line or two
Everybody knows the deal is rotten
Old Black Joe's still pickin' cotton
For your ribbons and bows
And everybody knows

And everybody knows that the plague is coming
Everybody knows that it's moving fast
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman
Are just a shining artifact of the past
Everybody knows the scene is dead
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed
That will disclose
What everybody knows

And everybody knows that you're in trouble
Everybody knows what you've been through
From the bloody cross on top of Calvary
To the beach of Malibu
Everybody knows it's coming apart
Take one last look at this Sacred Heart
Before it blows
And everybody knows

Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows

Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows

Everybody knows",True,True,28984255.0,rock music

Lyrics:

It's a new day, but it all feels old
It's a good life, that's what I'm told
But everything, it all just feels the same

At my high school, it felt more to me
Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there only made me see

That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna hear the words you say
And I don't ever wanna

I don't ever wanna be you

Lyrics:

Always see it on TV
Or read it in the magazines
Celebrities want sympathy
All they do is piss and moan
Inside the Rolling Stone
Talkin' about how hard life can be

I'd like to see them spend a week
Livin' life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two
Walkin' in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they'd fall
They would fall (fall)

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complainin'
Always complainin'
If money is such a problem
Well, they got mansions",True,True,184416166.0,alternative rock

Lyrics:

I need an alarm system in my house 
So I know when people are 
Creeping about
These people are
Freaking me out (these days)

It's getting hectic everywhere that I go
They won't leave me alone
There's things they all wanna know
I'm paranoid of all the people I meet
Why are they talking to me?
And why can't anyone see

I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live 
Just wanna live",True,True,82843050.0,pop punk

Lyrics:

Yeah, This song is dedicated
(This is Good Charlotte)
To every kid who ever got picked last in gym class
(You know what I'm saying, this is for you)
To every kid who never had a date to no school dance
(Run to your mother)
To every one who's ever been called a freak
This is for you
Here we, here we go...

Oh oh oh oh oh,
Oh oh oh oh oh

Like the time in school when we got free lunch
and the cool kids beat us up,
(Reduced lunch)
And the rich kids had convertibles
and we had to ride the bus
(55)
Like the time we made the baseball team
but they still laughed at us
(You still suck)
Like the time that girl broke up with me
'cause I wasn't cool enough

Lyrics:

She's going out to forget they were together
All that time he was taking her for granted
She wants to see, if there's more
Than he gave
She's looking for

He calls her up; he's trippin' on the phone now
He doesn't want her out there and alone now
He knows she's movin' it
Knows she's using it
Now he's losing it
She don't care

Everybody, put up your hands
Say: I don't wanna be in love 
I don't wanna be in love
Feel the beat now, if you've got nothing left
Say: I don't wanna be in love 
I don't wanna be in love
Back it up now, you've got a reason to live
Say: I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Feelin' good now, don't be afraid to get down
Say: I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love",True,True,102110353.0,pop punk

Lyrics:

As I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of L.A.
The footsteps that were next to me
Have gone their separate ways

I've seen enough now to know that beautiful things
Don't always stay that way
I've done enough now to know this beautiful place
Isn't everything they say

I heard that evil comes disguised
Like the city of angels
I'm walking towards the light

Baptized in the river
I've seen a vision of my life and I wanna be delivered
In the city was a sinner
I've done a lot of things wrong but I swear I'm a believer",True,True,92093771.0,pop punk

Lyrics: 

woke up to the sirens
still might be a good day
I got some shit that I'm hiding 
but I like kill myself real slowly

so pour another one for me 
And let me see how fast I fall
I got some frens who might never leave
and I ain't seen them since I been gone 
but I'm holding on

take this crown away from me
(take this crown away from me)
I hold myself with no esteem 
(I hold myself with no esteem)

there’s no joy in victory
(there's no joy, there's no joy)
all my heart feels is defeat 

see me right back where I started
they kept me so in the dark there
i try to relate with these people
they can’t see my face 
in this place 
I don’t need you 

I pray for the things that I wanted 
I got them each nail in my coffin 
Then realize we’re all broken hearted 
this game it was over 
the day that we started

take this crown away from me
(take this crown away from me)
I hold myself with no esteem 
(I hold myself with no esteem)

there’s no joy in victory
(there's no joy, there's no joy)
all my heart feels is defeat 
all my heart feels is defeat 

No kingdom 
no reason
can’t feel it
I can't see them 
so take this crown away from me

Looking for something i that I can hold to
you can’t tell on the outside
something crazy (I never told you)
I dig a grave full of my lies
can you understand my truth
then you might know why
Nite terrors, they creep in my room 
But still, I hold mine 

take this crown away from me
(take this crown away from me)
I hold myself with no esteem 
(I hold myself with no esteem)

there’s no joy in victory
(there's no joy, there's no joy)
all my heart feels is defeat 
all my heart feels is defeat 

No kingdom
no reasons
can’t feel it
I can't see them 
so take this crown away from me

No kingdom
no reasons
No love here
no seasons 
so take this crown away from me

If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man,

The pleasure is to play, makes no difference what you say,
I don't share your greed, the only card I need is

Going with the flow, it's all a game to me,
Seven or Eleven, snake eyes watching you,
Double up or quit, double stake or split,

The Ace Of Spades

You know I'm born to lose, and gambling's for fools,
But that's the way I like it baby, I don't wanna live forever
,And don't forget the joker!

Pushing up the ante, I know you got to see me,
Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again,
I see it in your eyes, take one look and die,
The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be,

Only way to feel the noise is when it's good and loud
So good I can't believe it, screaming with the crowd
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you

On your feet you feel the beat, it goes straight to your spine
Shake your head you must be dead if it don't make you fly
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you

Know your body's made to move, ya feel it in your guts

Lyrics
Shut up!

If you squeeze my lizard
I'll put my snake on you
I'm a romantic adventurer
And a reptile too

But it don't make no difference
'Cause I ain't gonna be, easy, easy
The only time I'm easy's when I'm
Killed by death, killed by death
Killed by death, come on!
I'm a lone wolf ligger
But I ain't no pretty boy
I'm a backbone shiver
And I'm a bundle of joy

But it don't make no difference
'Cause I ain't gonna be, easy, easy
The only time I'm easy's when I'm
Killed by death, killed by death
Killed by death, come on!

Killed by death, Killed by death
Killed by death, come on!
Come on, I said you're killed by death
Come on!
Killed by

Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death, ha-ha-ha-ha!
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Aah!

Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by a bunch of death!

Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death

Lyrics:
If the stars fall down on me
And the sun refused to shine
Then may the shackles be undone
May all the old words cease to rhyme
If the sky turned into stone
It will matter not at all
For there is no heaven in the sky
Hell does not wait for our downfall

Let the voice of reason chime
Let the pious vanish for all time
God's face is hidden, all unseen
You can't ask Him what it all means

He was never on your side
God was never on your side
Let right or wrong alone decide
God was never on your side

See ten thousand ministries
See the holy, righteous dogs
They claim to heal but all they do is steal
Abuse your faith, cheat and rob
If God is wise, why is He still
When these false prophets 
call Him friend?
Why is He silent? Is He blind?
Are we abandoned in the end?

Let the sword of reason shine
Let us be free of prayer and shrine
God's face is hidden, turned away
He never has a word to say

He was never on your side
God was never on your side
Let right or wrong alone decide
God was never on your side
No, no, no

He was never on your side
God was never on your side
Never, never, never, never
Never on your side
Never on your side

Lyrics

Let it be your best friend

You are the future, it's your time
You and you and you
Stay together, this is yours and mine
What we gonna do?

Rock out, rock out, rock out
Let it crush your fear
Rock out, rock out, rock out
And you can get it here

Here comes the bass, thunder in the guts
Rock 'til you can't stand
Now the guitar speaks, gonna drive you nuts
Power under your hand

You are the people, now you shine
You and you and you
Stay together, let me speak the line
What you gonna do?

Rock out, rock out, rock out
Let it crush your fear
Rock out, rock out, rock out
You can get it here

Rock out, rock out, with your cock out
Impress your lady friends
Rock out, rock out, rock out

:: Born to Raise Hell ::

Listen up here, I'll make it quite clear
I'm gonna put some boogie in your ear
Shake and bop, don't you stop
Dance like a maniac until you drop
I don't mind, I don't mind
I can run a razor right up your spine
What are you waiting for
What do you think you were created for

Show us you care, show us you dare
You don't know what happened, not if you weren't there

Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
We know to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
Voodoo medicine, cast my spell
Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
Play that guitar just like ringin' a bell
Take it or leave it

Going for broke, rock till you choke
It don't matter if you drink or smoke
Speak through the beat, get up on your feet
Sweating like a hound dog, white as a sheet

Don't you be scared, don't you be scared
Everybody terrified, I don't seem fair
What are you waiting for
What do you think you were created for

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Tarja Turunen]
In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again? For now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there inside my mind

[Verse 2: Marko Hietala]
Sing once again with me, our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there inside your mind

[Verse3: Tarja Turunen & Marko Hietala]
Those who have seen your face draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear, it's me they hear
Your spirit and my voice in one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there inside my/your mind

He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Beware, the Phantom of the Opera

[Verse 4: Tarja Turunen & Marko Hietala]
Where all your fantasies, you always knew
That man and mystery lay both in you
And in this labyrinth where night is blind
The Phantom of the Opera is here inside my/your mind

[Outro]
Sing, my Angel of Music
He's there the Phantom of the Opera
Sing for me
Sing, my Angel of Music
Sing for me

[Verse 1]
Leave the sleep and let the springtime talk
In tongues from the time before man
Listen to a daffodil tell her tale
Let the guest in, walk out, be the first to greet the morn...

The meadows of heaven await harvest
The cliffs unjumped, cold waters untouched
The elsewhere creatures yet unseen
Finally your number came up, free fall awaits the brave...

[Chorus]
Come!
Taste the wine, race the blind
They will guide you from the light
Writing noughts till the end of time
Come!
Surf the clouds, race the dark
It feeds from the runs undone
Meet me where the cliff greets the sea...

[Verse 2]
The answer to the riddle before your eyes
Is in dead leaves and fleeting skies
Returning swans and sedulous mice
Writings on the garden's book, in the minute of a lover's look

Building a sandcastle close to the shore
A house of cards from a worn out deck
A home from the fellowship, poise and calm
Write a lyric for the song only you can understand...

[Chorus]
Come!
Taste the wine, race the blind
They will guide you from the light
Writing noughts till the end of time
Come!
Surf the clouds, race the dark
It feeds from the runs undone
Meet me where the cliff greets the sea...

[Bridge]
Riding hard every shooting star
Come to life, open mind, have a laugh at the orthodox
Come, drink deep, let the dam of mind seep
Travel with great Élan, dance a jig at the funeral...

[Chorus]
Come!
Taste the wine, race the blind
They will guide you from the light
Writing noughts till the end of time
Come!
Surf the clouds, race the dark
It feeds from the runs undone
Meet me where the cliff greets the sea...
Come!

Lyrics:
[Intro]
I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel tonight

[Verse 1]
Deep into a dying day
I took a step outside an innocent heart
Prepare to hate me, fall when I may
This night will hurt you like never before

[Pre-Chorus]
Old loves, they die hard
Old lies, they die harder

[Chorus]
I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone
I'm in love with my lust
Burning angel wings to dust
I wish I had your angel tonight

[Bridge]
I'm going down so frail and cruel
Drunken disguise changes all the rules

[Pre-Chorus]
Old loves, they die hard
Old lies, they die harder

[Chorus]
I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone
I'm in love with my lust
Burning angel wings to dust
I wish I had your angel tonight

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Greatest thrill, not to kill
But to have the prize of the night
Hypocrite, wannabe friend
13th disciple who betrayed me for nothing!
Last dance, first kiss
Your touch, my bliss
Beauty always comes with dark thoughts

[Chorus]
I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone
I'm in love with my lust
Burning angel wings to dust
I wish I had your angel tonight

Nightwish - Nemo

This is me for forever
One of the lost ones
The one without a name
Without an honest heart as compass
This is me for forever
One without a name
These lines the last endeavor
To find the missing lifeline

Oh how I wish
For soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my everything

My flower, withered between
The pages 2 and 3
The once and forever bloom gone with my sins
Walk the dark path
Sleep with angels
Call the past for help
Touch me with your love
And reveal to me my true name

Oh how I wish
For soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my everything
Oh how I wish
For soothing rain
Oh how I wish to dream again
Once and for all
And all for once
Nemo my name forevermore

Nemo sailing home
Nemo letting go

Oh how I wish
For soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my everything
Oh how I wish
For soothing rain
Oh how I wish to dream again
Once and for all
And all for once
Nemo my name forevermore",False,False,65405454.0,symphonic metal

END OF ALL HOPE LYRICS:
It is the End of all Hope
To lose the child, the Faith
To end all the innocence
To be someone like me
This is the birth of all hope
To have what I once had
This life unforgiven
It will end with a Birth

No will to wake for this morn
To see another black rose born
Deathbed is slowly covered with snow

Angels, they fell first but I'm still here
Alone as they are drawing near
In heaven my masterpiece will finally be sung

Wounded is the deer that leaps highest
And my wound it cuts so deep
Turn off the light and let me pull the plug

Mandylion without a face
Deathwish without a prayer
End of hope
End of love
End of time
The rest is silence",False,True,33986251.0,symphonic metal

NIGHTWISH ""NOISE"" LYRICS

Crave the machine
Revere the screen
Zoom in for flak and misery
Bleed some pixels

Shoot yourself
Pose for the dead
Have a near-life experience
In a hot air matrix

Now you're a star
Vain avatar
Feeding the beast
In your loud Egoland

You have become
Tool of a tool
Digital ghouls
Telling you to
Shut up and dance!

Color a yarn and the crowds will gather

Noise
From a sunless world
Your mirror is black, only a copy stares back
At a slave of brave new world
Noise
To decoy the human voice
Brain insomniac, paranoiac
Endless noise

Please love me
See how I bleed
Please endure
I have such empathy in me

Hum, noise, hum
Beautifully numb
Tapping the quiet air
To have a meaning

By a carrion
Sad hologram
Lost in the maze
The real and human feel

Sunset is free
From this deity
The Earth has a real voice
Go out and get in

I will follow

Color a yarn and the crowds will gather

Noise
From a sunless world
Your mirror is black, only a copy stares back
At a slave of brave new world
Noise
To decoy the human voice
Brain insomniac, paranoiac
Endless noise

Feast your eyes on the black mirror
Feed the beast, join the gathering
Tell a tale
Feast of fears is drawing nearer

Beyond the human horizon
Something terrifying sleeps

Noise
From a sunless world
Your mirror is black, only a copy stares back
At a slave of brave new world
Noise
To decoy the human voice
Brain insomniac, paranoiac
Endless noise

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
They came for him one winter's night
Arrested, he was bound
They said there'd been a robbery
His pistol had been found

[Verse 2]
They marched him to the station house
He waited for the dawn
And as they led him to the dock
He knew that he'd been wronged
""You stand accused of robbery"" - he heard the bailiff say
He knew without an alibi
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom

[Chorus 1]
Over the hills and far away
For ten long years he'll count the days
Over the mountains, and the seas
A prisoner's life for him there'll be

[Verse 3]
He knew that it would cost him dear
But yet he dare not say
Where he had been that fateful night
A secret it must stay
He had to fight back tears of rage
His heart beat like a drum
For with the wife of his best friend
He spent his final night of freedom

[Chorus 2]
Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
Far from the mountains and the seas
Back in her arms is where he'll be
Over the hills and far away

[Post-Chorus]
Over the hills and, over the hills and
Over the hills and far away

[Verse 4]
Each night within his prison cell
He looks out through the bars
He reads the letters that she wrote
One day he'll know the taste of freedom

[Chorus 3]
Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms he swears she'll be
Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
Far from the mountains and the seas
Back in her arms is where he'll be
Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms is where she'll be

[Outro]
Over the hills
Over the hills and far away
Over the hills

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Sweet little words made for silence
Not talk
Young heart for love
Not heartache
Dark hair for catching the wind
Not to veil the sight of a cold world

[Chorus]
Kiss while your lips are still red
While he`s still silent
Rest while bosom is still untouched, unveiled
Hold another hand while the hand`s still without a tool
Drown into eyes while they`re still blind
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn

First day of love never comes back
A passionate hour`s never a wasted one
The violin, the poet`s hand
Every thawing heart plays your theme with care

[Chorus]
Kiss while your lips are still red
While he`s still silent
Rest while bosom is still untouched, unveiled
Hold another hand while the hand`s still without a tool
Drown into eyes while they`re still blind
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn

Kiss while your lips are still red
While he`s still silent
Rest while bosom is still untouched, unveiled
Hold another hand while the hand`s still without a tool
Drown into eyes while they`re still blind
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn",True,True,,symphonic metal

Esto no es más que otro sarao. 
En el que te has colao. 
Con un traje alquilao. 
Ni siquiera me han nominao. 
Cuando paso a su lao.
Qué coño le ha pasao.

Antes venían a verte, ahora no pueden ni verte.
Antes estabas al dente. Pisabas mucho más fuerte (x2).

No hace tanto que tenías la portada. 
En tu teta mi frase tatuada. 
Ahora tengo que esperar en la entrada. 
Ya no hay VIP ni mesa reservada. 
Ya no, ya no, ya no. 
La gente piensa en ti como algo que pasó. 
Delirios de grandeza, sueños de ambición. 
Cómo era que empezaba mi última canción. 

Esto no es más que otro sarao. 
En el que te has colao.
Con un traje alquilao. 
Ni siquiera me han nominao. 
Cuando paso a su lao. 
Qué coño le ha pasao. 

Antes venían a verte, ahora no pueden ni verte. 
Antes estabas al dente. Pisabas mucho más fuerte (x2).

Un mueble en mitad de la pista.
Expectativas las justas. 
Número uno en las listas. 
Siete de abril dos mil nunca.

LETRA TINTA Y TIEMPO

Lo que dejo por escrito
no está tallado en granito,
yo apenas suelto en el viento presentimientos.
Pido lo que necesito:
tinta y tiempo, tinta y tiempo
tinta y tiempo, tinta y tiempo.

Pero me cuesta esperar,
y cuando toca decantar
lentamente lo que siento...
yo me impaciento...
Luego lo vuelvo a intentar: 
tinta y tiempo, tinta y tiempo
tinta y tiempo, tinta y tiempo.

Nunca sé ni por qué, ni cuándo:
esa voz yo no la comando.

Y al final, siempre ando a tientas
sin brújula en la tormenta,
pero tras el desaliento
cada cuento
si ha de pintarse, se pinta: 
tiempo y tinta, tiempo y tinta
tiempo y tinta, tiempo y tinta.

Puede que nunca te calibre, corazón, 
siempre irás por libre.

Nunca sé ni por qué, ni cuándo:
esa voz yo no la comando.

Tinta y tiempo, tinta y tiempo
tinta y tiempo, tinta y tiempo.

Lyrics:
I lit out from reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didnt get to sleep last night till the morning came around.

Set out runnin but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight.

Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in utah in a cave up in the hills.

Set out runnin but I take my time, a friend of the devil is a friend of mine,
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight.

I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air.

Set out runnin but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight.

Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night,
The first ones named sweet anne marie, and shes my hearts delight.
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriffs on my trail,
And if he catches up with me, Ill spend my life in jail.

Got a wife in chino, babe, and one in cherokee
The first one says shes got my child, but it dont look like me.

Set out runnin but I take my time,
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine,
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight.",False,False,90385450.0,folk rock

Since then, the universal appeal of Robert Hunter’s serene prose and the band’s heartfelt performance have made the song a popular choice at everything from weddings to funerals. As relevant now as ever before, the enduring optimism of “Ripple” is a welcome reminder of better days ahead, when songs will, once again, fill the air. 

The American Beauty 50th Anniversary Edition is available now. The 3CD features the original album with newly remastered audio  plus one of the most requested archival recordings in the Dead's vault - the unreleased concert recorded on February 18, 1971 at the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY.

There are celebrated live performances from the 70s and 80s and official videos with more skeletons than you can shake your bones at, an exclusive seaside series on what's to come from the band's rich catalog and details on meet-ups all across the promised land. If it's community you’re after, try your hand at our yearly DEAD COVERS PROJECT competition and connect with fellow Dead Heads around the world. Heck, keep your eyes peeled you might even catch a glimpse of Pigpen on keys, Jerry in a GROOVE, Bobby tellin' tales, Mickey talkin' space, Phil and friends, Bill on the beach, or anyone from our extended family.

Lyrics:Truckin got my chips cashed in. keep truckin, like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line, just keep truckin on.

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on main street.
Chicago, new york, detroit and its all on the same street.
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings.

Dallas, got a soft machine; houston, too close to new orleans;
New yorks got the ways and means; but just wont let you be, oh no.

Most of the cast that you meet on the streets speak of true love,
Most of the time theyre sittin and cryin at home.
One of these days they know they better get goin
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone.

Truckin, like the do-dah man. once told me youve got to play your hand
Sometimes your cards aint worth a dime, if you dont layem down,

Sometimes the lights all shinin on me;
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me what a long, strange trip its been.

What in the world ever became of sweet jane? 
She lost her sparkle, you know she isnt the same
Livin on reds, vitamin c, and cocaine,
All a friend can say is aint it a shame? 

Truckin, up to buffalo. been thinkin, you got to mellow slow
Takes time, you pick a place to go, and just keep truckin on.

Sittin and starin out of the hotel window.
Got a tip theyre gonna kick the door in again
Id like to get some sleep before I travel,
But if you got a warrant, I guess youre gonna come in.

Busted, down on bourbon street, set up, like a bowlin pin.
Knocked down, it gets to wearin thin. they just wont let you be, oh no.

Youre sick of hangin around and youd like to travel;
Get tired of travelin and you want to settle down.
I guess they cant revoke your soul for tryin,
Get out of the door and light out and look all around.

Sometimes the lights all shinin on me;
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me what a long, strange trip its been.

Truckin, Im a goin home. whoa whoa baby, back where I belong,
Back home, sit down and patch my bones, and get back truckin on.
Hey now get back truckin home.",False,False,49128232.0,rock music

[Intro]
Comp-ton
Comp-ton
Comp-ton

Real m****phu***in G's...
Real m****phu***in G's...
Real m****phu***in G's...

[Eazy-E]
Hey Yo doctor, here's another proper track
And it's phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real s*** provoke, see you's a wannabe 'loc
And you'll get smoked and I hope that your fans understand
When you talk about spraying me, the same records that you makin' is paying me
M*****f*** Dre
M*****f*** Snoop
M*****f*** Death Row
Yo, and here comes my left blow
'cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E, and this is the season
To let the Real m****phu***in G's in, you're like a kid
You found a pup and now you're dapper,
But tell me where the f*** you found an anorexic rapper?
Talking 'bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only 60 pounds when you're wet and wearing boots
Damn E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is a G thing,
But on his old album covers he was a she thing
So n**** please, n**** please don't step to these m****phu***in' real G's

Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am ruthless
Yo, Dre, what's up? Boy you should've known by now
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am ruthless
Yo, Dre, what's up? Boy you should've known by now

[Dresta]
Every day it's a new rapper, claiming to be dapper than the Dresta,
Softer then a b**** but portray the role of gangster,
Ain't broke a law in your life, yet every time you rap
You yap about the guns and knife, just take a good look
At the n****, and you'll capture the fact,
That the b****** is simply just an actor,
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the Mental,
Of n***** in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf,
But yet in every verse you claim you used to do the dirt,
But tell me who's a witness to your f***ing work,
So you never handle business,
So save the drama j***,
n***** straight kill me knowing that they pranksters,
This is going out to you studio gangsters,
See I did dirt, put in work, and many n***** can vouch that,
So since I got stripes I got the right to rap about that,
But n***** like you
I gotta hate you, 'cause I'm just tired of suburbia n*****
Talking about they come from projects
Knowing you ain't seen the parts of the streets G
Think you started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearing khakis and mob while you rhyme, little f** tried to sag,
But you're flooding at the same time,
And your set don't accept you, scared to kick it with your homies
'cause you know they don't respect you,
So n**** please check nuts before you step to these, m****phu***in real G's

[B.G. Knocc Out]
Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition original baby gangster
Approach me like you hard, m****phu***er I'mma bank you
Shank you, with my f***ing shank, if I have to
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are f***ing actors
Pranksters, studio gangsters, busters
But this time you're dealing with some real m****phu***ers
G's, n**** please, don't try to step
Because if you do, and I peeled cap is all that would be left
See, young n***** like me will break you off something,
Claiming my city, but, Dre, you ain't from Compton
n***** like you all is what I call wannabes
And ain't s*** compared to real m****phu***in' G's

Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am ruthless
Yo, Dre, what's up?
Boy, you should've known by now

[Eazy-E]
I never met an OG who never did s*** wrong
You tried to diss the Eazy-E so now, n****, it's on you and your Doggy Dogg,
Think that you all hoggin' s***
Both of you b****** can come and suck my Doggy d***
Beating up a b**** don't make you s***,
But then again some n***** think it makes a man,
Damn it's a trip
How a n**** could switch so quick from wearing lipstick
To smoking on Chronic at picnics, and now you think you're bigger
But to me you ain't nothing but a b****-**s n****
That ain't worth a food stamp, and at
Death Row, I hear you're getting treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions, or get your a**
Popped with this Smith and Wesson,
Learn a lesson from the Eaz'
Stay in your place and don't step to Real m****phu***in G's

Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am ruthless!
Yo, Dre
Boy you should have known by now..
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am ruthless!
Yo, Dre
Boy you should have known by now...
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am ruthless!
Yo, Dre
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy does it.

""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" is the solo debut single by Eazy-E as a part of N.W.A. The song was originally on N.W.A. and the Posse, which started with the phrase: ""Cruisin' down the street in my '64"". Ruthless Records executive Jerry Heller considers the song to be a mix of Gil Scott-Heron, The Last Poets, the Rolling Stones, and the Black Panthers. This samples ""I'm a Ho"" by Whodini and vocal samples from, ""Hold It, Now Hit It"" by Beastie Boys as well as ""Mr. Big Stuff"" by Jean Knight. It was remixed and featured on Eazy's debut album Eazy-Duz-It, which was released in 1988. It was remixed again and was featured on Eazy-E's third album, It's On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa (1993) under the name ""Boyz-n-the-Hood (G-Mix)"".

""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" is the solo debut single by Eazy-E as a part of N.W.A. The song was originally on N.W.A. and the Posse, which started with the phrase: ""Cruisin' down the street in my '64"". Ruthless Records executive Jerry Heller considers the song to be a mix of Gil Scott-Heron, The Last Poets, the Rolling Stones, and the Black Panthers. This samples ""I'm a Ho"" by Whodini and vocal samples from, ""Hold It, Now Hit It"" by Beastie Boys as well as ""Mr. Big Stuff"" by Jean Knight. It was remixed and featured on Eazy's debut album Eazy-Duz-It, which was released in 1988. It was remixed again and was featured on Eazy-E's third album, It's On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa (1993) under the name ""Boyz-n-the-Hood (G-Mix)"".

Eric Lynn Wright (September 7, 1963  March 26, 1995) R.I.P., better known by the stage name Eazy-E, was an American rapper, producer, and record executive from Compton, California.
Eazy-E was a Kelly Park Compton Crip during his teen years, and he openly associated himself with other Crips. He sold drugs during his early teen years and then invested the money he made into a hip hop enterprise. He is widely regarded as one of the founders of the gangsta rap subgenre and initially rose to fame as the founder and member of the group N.W.A, but later achieved critical and commercial success as a solo artist. Eazy-E's vocal style was marked by his youthful, high-pitched voice and his lyrics focusing on the elements of urban street life such as guns, drugs, relations between residents and the police, and sexual activity. He had also for some time hosted a hip-hop radio show on Los Angeles-based radio station KKBT.

Eric Wright, the son of Richard and Kathie Wright, dropped out of high school in the tenth grade and supported himself by selling drugs, later receiving a high school equivalency diploma. He used the profits from his drug sales to establish Ruthless Records. When Ruthless signees Dr. Dre and Ice Cube wrote ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"", Ahmed Saaoud and Eazy E formed the group N.W.A with Dr. Dre and Ice Cube. Later, DJ Yella and Arabian Prince were added.
In this period, Ruthless Records released the compilation N.W.A and the Posse (1987), N.W.A's proper debut Straight Outta Compton (1988), and one month later, Eazy-E's solo album, Eazy-Duz-It. The album sold two million copies, certifying it as a double platinum album, and spawned the hit singles ""We Want Eazy"" and ""Eazy-Er Said Than Dunn"" (a remix of ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" was also included). The album was produced by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella and largely written by Ice Cube, with contributions from MC Ren and The D.O.C..
On the final N.W.A album, Niggaz4Life (1991), some of the lyrics provoked outrage from many liberals and conservatives alike. Eazy-E included pistols and shotguns in videos for both ""Alwayz into Somethin'"" and ""Appetite for Destruction"".
Disputes about money caused the group to break up. It was thought that Eazy-E and Jerry Heller were stealing money from the group. Ice Cube is believed to have left N.W.A for this reason, which he later referenced in his diss song, ""No Vaseline"". Subsequently, Eazy-E and Dr. Dre started feuding - a feud that grew to embroil most of Ruthless Records and Dr. Dre's new label, Death Row Records with Merrill. Eazy-E released It's On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa and a posthumous album Str8 off tha Streetz of Muthaphukkin Compton which both went multi-platinum.
Eazy-E accepted an invitation to a lunch benefiting the Republican Senatorial Inner Circle, hosted by then-President George H. W. Bush in March 1991. A spokesman for the rapper claimed that Eazy-E supported Bush for overseeing Operation Desert Storm.

At the start of Dr. Dre's defection from Ruthless Records, executives Mike Klein and Jerry Heller sought assistance from the Jewish Defense League (JDL). Klein, former Ruthless Records director of business affairs said this provided Ruthless Records with muscle to enter into negotiations with Death Row Records over Dr. Dre's departure. While Suge Knight violently sought an outright release from Ruthless Records for Dr. Dre, the JDL and Ruthless Records management were able to sit down with Death Row and negotiate a release in which the record label would continue to receive money and publishing rights from future Dr. Dre projects. It was under these terms that Dr. Dre left Ruthless Records and formed Death Row with Suge Knight. The FBI launched a money laundering investigation, assuming that the JDL was extorting money from Ruthless Records to fight their extremist causes. This led to JDL spokesperson Irv Rubin issuing a press release stating ""There was nothing but a close, tight relationship"" between Eazy-E and the organization.

In March 1995, Eazy-E checked himself into Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles with what he believed at the time was chronic asthma. Following comprehensive tests, it was discovered that he was suffering from AIDS, and his condition deteriorated rapidly. During the week of March 20, already having made amends with Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, Eazy-E drafted what would be his last message to his fans. On March 26, 1995, ten days after being admitted into the hospital, Eazy-E died at the age of 31. He was buried at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California.

Lyrics:

Every time I look into your lovely eyes,
I see a love that money just can't buy.
One look from you, I drift away.
I pray that you are here to stay.

Anything you want, you got it.
Anything you need, you got it.
Anything at all, you got it.
Baby! 

Every time I hold you I begin to understand,
Everything about you tells me I'm your man.
I live my life to be with you.
No one can do the things you do.
Anything you want, you got it.
Anything you need, you got it.
Anything at all, you got it.
Baby!
Anything you want
Anything you need
Anything at all",True,True,171297511.0,country rock

Lyrics:
A candy-colored clown they call the sandman
Tiptoes to my room every night
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper
""Go to sleep. Everything is all right.""

I close my eyes, then I drift away
Into the magic night, I softly say
A silent prayer like dreamers do
Then I fall asleep to dreams, my dreams of you

In dreams I walk with you, in dreams I talk to you
In dreams you're mine, all of the time
We're together in dreams, in dreams

But just before the dawn, I awake and find you gone
I can't help it, I can't help it, if I cry
I remember that you said goodbye

It's too bad that all these things
Can only happen in my dreams
Only in dreams, in beautiful dreams

I had to escape
The city was sticky and cruel 
Maybe I should have called you first 
But I was dying to get to you 

I was dreaming while I drove the long straight road ahead, uh-huh, yeah 
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide 
This fever for you was just burning me up inside

Crying to get to you

Crying, crept in your room 
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you

Lyrics:
Darkness falls and she will take me by the hand
Take me to some twilight land
Where all but love is grey
Where I can't find my way
Without her as my guide
Night falls I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn and burn eternally
She's a mystery to me
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
In the night of love words tangled in her hair
Words soon to disappear
A love so sharp it cut
Like a switchblade to my heart
Words tearing me apart
She tears again my bleeding heart
I want to run she's pulling me apart
Fallen angel cries and I just melt away
She's a mystery to me
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
Haunted by her side is the darkness in her eyes
That so enslaves me
But if my love is blind
Then I don't want to see
She's a mystery to me
Night falls I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn and burn eternally
She's a mystery to me
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl

IN FLAMES ""ONLY FOR THE WEAK"" LYRICS

I can't tolerate your sadness
Cause it's me you are drowning
I won't allow any happiness
Cause every time you laugh, I feel so guilty, I feel so guilty

Am I forced to have any regret
I've become the lie, Beautiful and free
In my righteous own mind
I adore and preach the insanity you gave to me

Sell me the infection, it is only for the weak
No need for sympathy, The misery that is me

I've lost the ability to pain the clouds
Cause it's me you're draining
I'm stuck in this slow-motion dark day
Cause every time you run, I fall.. Behind, I fall behind

And so I hear my voice again
The tale of the bitter man here I am
Shake the silence and hear what it says
The tranquil pride that become the lie

Sell me to infection, it is only for the weak
No need for sympathy, the misery that is me

Sell me to infection, it is only for the weak
On bleeding knees, I accept my fate

Sell me to infection, it is only for the weak
No need for sympathy, the misery that is me

Sell me to infection, it is only for the weak
On bleeding knees, I accept my fate

LYRICS:
Meet your maker 
Say something that makes sense 
These are your last words 
So make them worth the wait 

Meet your maker 
It’s time to set things straight 
These are your last words 
Make them count or it’s too late 

In time we all disappear  
We’re pushed to the edge 
The countdown has begun 

At the end of the masquerade  
Your time’s up, now there’s hell to pay 
It’s only down from here 
You think you have a choice but there’s no other way 

Meet your maker 
As you receive the final key 
These are your last words 
Are you ready to see what lies beneath? 

Meet your maker 
Everything else is dead 
This is the final moment 
All is done and all is said

IN FLAMES ""CLOUD CONNECTED"" LYRICS

People like you
You live in a dream world
You despise the outside and you fear the next one

It's in your dream
There's just one question
Should I kill
Or should I be left behind?
Sick and tired
Of all your complaints
This is the hour
We bring it down

I've come to realize
With every little glimpse you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected
Cloud connected

You seem to be
So introverted
How come we fail with all that is given

You crossed the line
You remember my name
Time runs backwards as we're heading that way

I've come to realize
With every little glimpse you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected
Cloud connected
(Cloud connected)

I've come to realize
With every little glimpse you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected
Cloud connected

LYRICS:
If you look in the mirror and don’t like what is there 
Is it the one you despise with no tears to spare?  

How did we end up here? 
Burn all the empires and face what you fear 

As the day passes we watch the world corrode 
Vampires in daylight, the condemned are here to stay 

I don’t see, I don’t hear, are you even there? 
I need you right now with all the troubles I’ve seen 
I can’t tell the beginning from the end 
Call upon The Innocent at every breaking wave 

Nothing is holy for the clouded eye 
The tremors, the thunder, the lights go out 
With all the lies, the ultimate consequence 
We all know what’s the end of this route

Cut my throat and throw me to the wolves
I’m just too tired to re-load

Don’t need your tears, I don’t need your love
Don’t need your sympathy

I’ll be the ghost that haunts you in your sleep
You have anchored the hate in me
Don’t need your….

My god, I don’t need you
I won’t wait for you to come around

My god, As the pain inflicts
I know I bleed, I bleed for this

IN FLAMES ""THE QUIET PLACE"" LYRICS

Spinning further, deeper
I know you're out to try me
I'm not in this to be a slave
Push the dirt
Make me feel
Locate what swallows life night bird you build my world
And then I close my eyes
And then I close my eyes

Judge me now
Used to be afraid to let it show, bow down
A king in my own mind
Everything's in place
So much brighter from today

Drown the monster
Make all bad dreams go away
Whatever it takes to keep your hands free
Open scars
The quiet place
All the bridges fall to the ground
And you say you sacrificed
And then I close my eyes
And then I close my eyes

Judge me now
Used to be afraid to let it show, bow down (bow down)
A king in my own mind
Everything's in place
So much brighter from today
A king in my own mind

A king in my own mind
(Judge me now)
A king in my own mind
(Judge me now)
Used to be afraid to let it show, bow down (bow down)
A king in my own mind
Everything's in place
So much better from today
A king in my own mind

LYRICS:
Back to reality once again 
A two-year break to reset our brains 
But times are changing for the worse 
We are doomed, we are cursed 

Nothing but pain 
This is the end 

Bend the truth to fit you opinion 
Another excuse, another lie 
It’s not what you say, it’s what you do 
The sky is on fire and the angels cry 

The lines are drawn and the rules are set 
Your actions, the world won’t forget 
Nowhere to run, there’s no escape 
Misery’s here, there’s no hope left 

Mankind, too unkind to be renowned 
Joey was right, this is the final countdown

LYRICS:
It is my reflection  
But I know it’s not me 
I am becoming something else 
I feel the weight of the key 

This place is falling apart 
There’s no way back 
Passing through the gates 
A new shadow will reveal itself 

The stories have run their course 
None of them make sense 
We’re all someone else’s fool 
Buried in our own debris 

Destroy the things you know 
Destroy yourself in shame 
Before tomorrow comes 
Destroy everything 

Faith alone won’t sustain 
We’re in a state of slow decay 
I hear forgive and forget 
But I see there’s no way 

Seen it through the accolades 
It all should be a great success

Lyrics:

Tengo marcado en el pecho, 
todos los dÃ­as que el tiempo 
no me dejÃ³ estar aquÃ­. 
Tengo una fe que madura, 
que va conmigo y me cura 
desde que te conocÃ­. 
Tengo una huella perdida 
entre tu sombra y la mÃ­a, 
que no me deja mentir. 
Soy una moneda en la fuente; 
tÃº mi deseo pendiente 
mis ganas de revivir. 
Tengo una maÃ±ana constante
y una acuarela esperando 
verte pintado de azul. 
Tengo tu amor y tu suerte 
y un caminito empinado. 
Tengo el mar del otro lado: 
tÃº eres mi norte y mi sur 

Hoy voy a verte de nuevo 
voy a envolverme en tu ropa, 
susÃºrrame en tu silencio 
cuando me veas llegar. 
Hoy voy a verte de nuevo, 
voy a alegrar tu tristeza: 
vamos a hacer una fiesta 
pa' que este amor crezca mÃ¡s.",True,True,5284319.0,Latin pop

Lyrics:

Tengo marcado en el pecho, 
todos los dÃ­as que el tiempo 
no me dejÃ³ estar aquÃ­. 
Tengo una fe que madura, 
que va conmigo y me cura 
desde que te conocÃ­. 
Tengo una huella perdida 
entre tu sombra y la mÃ­a, 
que no me deja mentir. 
Soy una moneda en la fuente; 
tÃº mi deseo pendiente 
mis ganas de revivir. 
Tengo una maÃ±ana constante
y una acuarela esperando 
verte pintado de azul. 
Tengo tu amor y tu suerte 
y un caminito empinado. 
Tengo el mar del otro lado: 
tÃº eres mi norte y mi sur 

Hoy voy a verte de nuevo 
voy a envolverme en tu ropa, 
susÃºrrame en tu silencio 
cuando me veas llegar. 
Hoy voy a verte de nuevo, 
voy a alegrar tu tristeza: 
vamos a hacer una fiesta 
pa' que este amor crezca mÃ¡s.",True,True,40172342.0,Latin pop

☺ LYRICS ☺

Memories of you and me 
Tumble inside my head 
The way that we used to be 
Things that we said 

No one has ever made me believe so strong 
You left me to wonder 
How did our love go wrong?

Angelia, where you running to now? 
Angelia, got to make you turn around 

I lie awake at night 
Wait for the sun to shine 
I still feel you next to me 
Your lips on mine
 
Without a warning 
You made our love a lie 
When you said you were sorry 
But you never told me why 

Oooh Angelia, where you running to now? 
Angelia, got to make you turn around 

Maybe my love is in vain 
Maybe you're the hurting kind 
Can't take no more of this pain 
I've got to get you off my mind
...get you off my mind 

Tried to be what you wanted 
I gave you all I had 
Girl you left me with nothin' 
Nothin' but a photograph 

Ohohoh Angelia, where you running to now? 
Angelia, won't you please turn 'round?
Angelia, where you running to now? 
Angelia, where you running to now?
Where you running to now?
