Lyrics:

Nella fantasia io vedo un mondo giusto,
Lì tutti vivono in pace e in onestà.
Io sogno d'anime che sono sempre libere,
Come le nuvole che volano,
Pien' d'umanità in fondo all'anima.

Nella fantasia io vedo un mondo chiaro,
Lì anche la notte è meno oscura.
Io sogno d'anime che sono sempre libere,
Come le nuvole che volano.

Nella fantasia esiste un vento caldo,
Che soffia sulle città, come amico.
Io sogno d'anime che sono sempre libere,
Come le nuvole che volano,
Pien' d'umanità in fondo all'anima

English translation:

In my fantasy I see a just world
Where everyone lives in peace and honesty
I dream of souls that are always free
Like a cloud that floats
Full of humanity in the depths of the soul

In my fantasy I see a bright world
Where each night there is less darkness
I dream of souls that are always free
Like the cloud that floats

In my fantasy exists a warm wind
That breathes into the city, like a friend
I dream of souls that are always free
Like the cloud that floats
Full of humanity in the depths of the soul",False,False,4651467.0,popular music

Mariah Carey, Kirk Franklin & Khalid – “Fall In Love At Christmas”

The days are cold here amidst the drifts of snow
Just a metaphor of us so many Christmases ago
We had a love so deep just like the joy the season brings
So let’s fall in love again this Christmas night

And every Christmas I’ll be there
This time of year, we’re both aware
We gotta fall in love again at Christmas time
And all the angels in the sky
Shine down on us as we roll by
We gotta fall in love again at Christmas time

And the candles glow
I’m awake but no one knows
Just waiting patiently to hear the sleigh bells jingle, there they go
And while the Northern Star
Lights the way I dream of us
So let’s fall in love again this Christmas night

And every Christmas I’ll be there
This time of year, we’re both aware
We gotta fall in love again at Christmas time
And all the angels in the sky
Shine down on us as we roll by
We gotta fall in love again at Christmas time

Fa la la, fall in love with the feeling
Fa la la, fall in love trust believe we can
Fall in love again at Christmas time
(Help me sing it again)

Fa la la, fall in love tis the season
Don’t forget there’s a reason
We gotta fall in love again at Christmas time

And every Christmas I’ll be there
This time of year we’re both aware
We gotta fall in love again at Christmas time
And all the angels in the sky
Shine down on us as we roll by
We gotta fall in love again this Christmas time
We gotta fall in love at Christmas time

I say we pray
Pray that we will find
Love for all mankind
This Christmas time

We all need grace
To heal our troubled minds
It’s not that hard to find
This Christmas time

Everyone together we pray
Pray that we will find
Love for all mankind
This Christmas time

We all need grace upon
Grace upon 
Grace upon
To heal our troubled minds
It’s not that hard to find
It’s Christmas time

More than ever before
Love needs to be something we do
Not something we say
This holiday season, let’s give love away
It’s Christmas

Lyrics:
I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
Fell from heaven like a shower

I smile, even though I hurt see I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
I smile, smile
It's so hard to look up when you been down
Sure would hate to see you give up now
You look so much better when you smile, so smile

Fear is Not My Future was written by Brandon Lake, Jonathan Jay, Hannah Shackleford & Nicole Hannel.  It is from Maverick City Music’s collaboration album with Kirk Franklin entitled “Kingdom Book One” Available Now!

On June 17, 2015, nine African-American men and women lost their lives in a single act of hatred during a weekly Bible study at Mother Emanuel AMEC in Charleston, SC. Seven years after the tragedy, Fear Is Not My Future was recorded in April 2022 to commemorate and honor the lives lost during the Charleston shooting. This song is a declaration of hope in the midst of our trials and tribulations.

 The heart behind this project is to not only expand the idea of what the Kingdom of God looks like, but to also share and spread music and a message that taps into an inspirational and unfiltered love for all people.

You can stream Fear is Not My Future on “Kingdom Book One” Available on all major platforms.

Lyrics

Verse 1
Let Him turn it in your favor
Watch Him work it for your good
He’s not done with what He’s started
He’s not done until it’s good
So let Him turn it in your favor
Watch Him work it for your good
He’s not done with what He’s started
He’s not done until it’s good

Chorus
Hello Peace
Hello Joy
Hello Love
Hello Strength
Hello Hope
It’s a new horizon

Verse 2
If you’re ready for a breakthrough
Just open up and just receive
Cause what He’s pouring out is nothing
You’ve ever seen

Bridge 1
Fear is not my future
You are, You are
Sickness is not my story
You are, You are
Heartbreak’s not my home
You are, You are
Death is not the end
You are, You are

Bridge 2
Goodbye fear
Goodbye guilt
Goodbye shame
Goodbye pain
Goodbye grave
It’s a new horizon

Tag
Let the Light in
Let the Light on in
It’s a new horizon

Lyrics

Verse 1
My heart has always longed for something more
I searched the stars to knock on Heaven's door
Creation groans for God to be revealed
Every wound we carry will be healed

Pre Chorus
My eyes on the Son
Lord Your will be done

Chorus
Thine is the Kingdom
The power the glory
Forever and ever
He finished my story
We’re singing freedom
Our testimony
We’ll be singing forever, amen
We’ll be singing forever and ever, amen

Verse 2
Beautiful each color that He made
Your love's the only remedy for hate
You'll return to set the prisoners free
‘Til then Your will on Earth be done in me

Bridge
If you've ever wondered
What Heaven looks like
It’s looking like me and you
If you've ever questioned
What Heaven sounds like
Just let it fill the room

Tag 1
He's coming, He's coming
All hail King Jesus

Tag 2
If you wanna know what Heaven looks like
Lookin' like me and you
If you wanna know what Heaven sounds like
Just let it fill the room

Crowe portrays the loyal Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when the Emperor's ambitious son, Commodus, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murder of his family and his Emperor.

Released in the United States on May 5, 2000, Gladiator was a box office success, receiving positive reviews, and was credited with briefly reviving the historical epic. The film was nominated for and won multiple awards, particularly five Academy Awards in the 73rd Academy Awards including Best Picture. Although there have been talks of both a prequel and sequel, as of 2012, no production has begun.
Gladiator is the original soundtrack of the 2000 film of the same name. The original score and songs were composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard and was released in 2000, entitled Gladiator: Music From the Motion Picture. The Lyndhurst Orchestra performing the score was conducted by Gavin Greenaway.

The album won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and was also nominated for the Academy Award and BAFTA Award for Best Score (""Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music"").
The Oscar-nominated score was composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, and conducted by Gavin Greenaway. Lisa Gerrard's vocals are similar to her own work on The Insider score.[42] The music for many of the battle scenes has been noted as similar to Gustav Holst's ""Mars: The Bringer of War"", and in June 2006, the Holst Foundation sued Hans Zimmer for allegedly copying the late Gustav Holst's work.[43][44] Another close musical resemblance occurs in the scene of Commodus's triumphal entry into Rome, accompanied by music clearly evocative of two sections—the Prelude to Das Rheingold and Siegfried's Funeral March from Götterdämmerung—from Wagner's Ring of the Nibelungs. The ""German"" war chant in the opening scene was borrowed from the 1964 film Zulu, one of Ridley Scott's favorite movies. On February 27, 2001, nearly a year after the first soundtrack's release, Decca produced Gladiator: More Music From the Motion Picture. Then, on September 5, 2005, Decca produced Gladiator: Special Anniversary Edition, a two-CD pack containing both the above mentioned releases. Some of the music from the film was featured in the NFL playoffs in January 2003 before commercial breaks and before and after half-time.[45] In 2003, Luciano Pavarotti released a recording of himself singing a song from the film and said he regretted turning down an offer to perform on the soundtrack.[46] The Soundtrack is one of the best selling film scores of all time, and also among the most popular.

Lyrics:

Tonight's the night were gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
Give in this time and show me some affection
We're goin for those pleasures in the night
I want to love you
Feel you
And rap myself around you
I want to squeese you
Please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow
I'll let it go

I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it
I'm about to loose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it

Lyrics:

Your eyes tell me how you love me
Can feel it in your heart beat
I know you like what you see
Hold me, I'll give that you need
Wrap your love around me

Getting hotter, oh baby
I'll take you down, I'll take you down

The older they got, the more they realized that they wanted to expand into other musical styles, much to the dismay of their parents. Bonnie and June started off as Pointers, A Pair and were having some success when Anita decided to join them. 

From that point on, they started doing background vocals for Grace Slick, Sylvester James, Boz Scaggs and Elvin Bishop, which led to their being signed to Atlantic Records in 1971. They had no hits on Atlantic and by the time Ruth joined, they secured a new contract with Blue Thumb Records.

Around this time they recorded for ""Sesame Street"" a song called ""Pinball Number Count"" which became very popular on the show. The single ""Yes We Can Can"" opened them up to pop audiences and expanded their R&B fan base. Their 1978 LP ""Energy"" included their specially tailored Springsteen song ""Fire"" and this lesser known song ""Happiness"" which I always loved...written by Allen Toussaint. 

They became even more popular in the early to mid 80's with their electrifying singles ""Jump (For My Love)"", ""Automatic"", ""Neutron Dance"" and ""I'm So Excited"". While those songs brought them world wide recognition, I'm still a big fan of their songbook from the early days up to 1978. This pumping song has all the elements of a good dance song, nice changes and mid tempo beat considered to be ""sleaze"" for those late night lets dance in the dark times at the club.",False,False,6628197.0,country music

I pass through noise and silence, I walk alone
It's a beautiful day, it's raining and it's cold.
Reflected onto the wet pavement, Can you see what I see? 
The trembling image of my eyes that are still free.

I pass through noise and silence, I walk alone
It's a beautiful day, it's raining and it's cold
Reflected onto the wet pavement, can you see what I see?
The trembling image of my eyes that are still free.

And they say silver, I choose gold
I'm not afraid to be alone
Someone will judge his gentle soul
Let the boy cry and he will know

And they say silver I choose gold wooooo
I've never done as I've been told woh oh oh oh oh

You're always waiting for somebody and you don't like 
Yourself they made you change, do you remember when 
You were someone else?
Soldiers and dolls won't give away my childhood dreams
I was a pirate, I conquered, and I sailed free.

You're always waiting for somebody and you don't like

Soldiers and dolls won't give away my childhood dreams

I'm not afraid to be alone
Someone will judge her crazy soul
Let the girl fight and she will know

And they say silver, I choose gold

Lyrics:
It's your name I hear
It's not my head's whid
Like the many tears I shed
It's your name I call
Your name I read
My prayer
My creed
It's your name I hate
because I love you still
And I can't live this way
It's your name I keep
The only thing
You can't take away from me

I wanna hold you so...
Someday
I'm gonna dive in your eyes...
Deep cast
And I wanna please you so...
Please stay
And I won't lead you...
FARAWAY

Weo-weo-weo-we-he!
Weo-weo-weo-we-e-eo.
Weo-weo-weo-we-he

It's your name I feel
The pact
I seal your name
It's your name I call
Under the sky
Salty like the tears I cried

It's your name I hate
Because I love you still
And I can't live this way
It's your name I keep
The only…

Riding backseats on night highways
Dark spaces white lights through the window
I'm moving too fast through my life
While the moon remains constant in the sky

The night is holding its breath
Inside in silence I'm dead,
But if I make it until tomorrow
I know that my fear will be gone
And so I'm waiting for the morning to come

Riding backseats on night highways
Dark spaces white lights through the window
I'm moving too fast through my life
While the moon remains constant in the sky

The night is holding its breath
Inside in silence I'm dead,
But if I make it until tomorrow
I know that my fear will be gone
And so I'm waiting for the morning to come

Come, come, come into my life
Come, come, stay with me
Nobody loves me, nobody loves me enough
Enough to save me, oh no
Nobody loves me, nobody loves me enough
Enough to save me, oh no

I'm breathing the silence tonight
Won't I ever arrive where I am going?
I'm saying your name inside
While the moon is following my ride

Only now, I can let this night go by
The black earth breaks the day
I don't want my heart to dry
It says come into my life

It says
Come, come, come into my life
Come, come, stay with me
Nobody loves me, nobody loves me enough
Enough to save me, oh no
Nobody loves me, nobody loves me enough
Enough to save me, oh no

If I say I'll forget you, I'm lying
Looking for you I'm still waiting
Whatever I do with my life
The moon remains constant in the sky

Just today I knew what was right
But on this silent day
I can hear my voice inside
It says come into my life

It says
Come, come, come into my life
Come, come, stay with me
Nobody loves me, nobody loves me enough
Enough to save me, oh no
Nobody loves me, nobody loves me enough
Enough to save me, oh no

She's leaking! She's soaking wet
She leaking! Soaking wet
Shake it like a salt shaker (shake it like a salt shaker)

Shake that ___ for the tip if you a badd _____
Drop it down to the floor if you a badd _____
Aw nah she ain't a __ she just a badd _____

LYRICS

Women always talkin' about what men do
We don't never talk about what women do...at least 'til now
Come on

Every now and then you get mad (Huh)
Sometime I make you sad (Huh)
Make you want to say kiss my pants (Huh)
I'm tired of listenin' to you naggin'
Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known
I should have left that girl alone
But now I'm stuck with
Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known (Should have known)
I should have left that girl alone
But now I'm stuck with (NAGGIN)

This for them fellas who be messin round with them women
And you get your heart caught up in a mess
'Cause you lust just to touch what's up her dress
And never paid attention
'Cause you didn't think the girl would start trippin'
Shawty flip the script
Start saying all type of stuff out of her lips
I'ma tell you what I can't stand
When a woman play the role of a man
Talkin' to a fella like you got to hold his hand
Treat him like a spare, like he lack to understand
I know you know that I ain't gon' go for this jaw jackin' all the time
Talkin' to me out of line, broad, you done lost your mind
You gon' mess round and get me some time

Every now and then you get mad (Huh)
Sometime I make you sad (Huh)
Make you want to say ""kiss my pants"" (Huh)
I'm tired of listenin' to you naggin'
Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known
I should have left that girl alone
But now I'm stuck with
Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known (Should have known)
I should have left that girl alone
But now I'm stuck with (NAGGIN)

I need a lil more grip a lil less lip
Before I pack my bag on you girl and dip
At the point of no return and you made it that way
By the stuff that you say in and out every day
Hope you payin' attention, 'cause I gots to mention
Dissin' me in front of your friends
Tryin' to get a lil laugh in, joke crackin'
Then I wanna ____ __ ____ then
Hide behind your fake lil grin with your fake lil friend
Used to them fake lil men
Really ain't a man but you like how he pretend
I'm gonna keep sippin' my Henn and smokin' my herb
In my ear loud and clear with your naggin' words
The way you talk is absurd, gettin' on my nerves
All in my ear, got me 'bout to hit the curb
(SHUT UP!)

Every now and then you get mad (Huh)
Sometime I make you sad (Huh)
Make you want to say ""kiss my pants"" (Huh)
I'm tired of listenin' to you naggin'
Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known
I should have left that girl alone
But now I'm stuck with
Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known (Should have known)
I should have left that girl alone
But now I'm stuck with (NAGGIN)

One day I got shot by Cupid
In the midst of this, relationship went stupid
We went from talkin' on the phone too long
To nowadays you never at home
You always call, tellin' me you out with your friends
But I find out later on you with your other men
Then, you ain't in it for the dividends
Say you cut and cut and you ain't gettin' nothin'
That's a shame it ended like this
Now I ain't got love for ya, trick
Shoo fly don't bother me
Will I get back with her? Probably
Then I thought about it, I won't
Do I really want you? I don't
The headache I really don't want
So I'ma leave her alone, 'cause I can do bad on my own
That's why she gone

Every now and then you get mad (Huh)
Sometime I make you sad (Huh)
Make you want to say ""kiss my pants"" (Huh)
I'm tired of listenin' to you naggin'
Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known
I should have left that girl alone
But now I'm stuck with
Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known (Should have known)
I should have left that girl alone
But now I'm stuck with (NAGGIN)

Now, this is not a song disrespecting women
This is a song that Ying Yang made for every man that ever walked God's green earth
'I don't do's' don't amount up to 'I do do's'
But your attitude stink sometimes
So sit on that...HANH!
NAGGIN!

為你寫下這首情歌
Song for You

｜如果你   忘了我   
｜就讓風   代替我
｜為你寫下這首情歌   陪著你走   

當白雲變蒼狗
回望故事  多不多
細數收穫  夠不夠
曾追求的夢   還夢不夢

當命運的路口
帶你緩緩走向我
讓我深深的愛過
才終於學會   即使笨拙   也要執著

｜如果你   記得我
｜你和我   曾走過
｜走過擁有你的此生   別無所求 

｜如果你   忘了我   
｜就讓風   代替我
｜為你寫下這首情歌   陪著你走  

如天地與蜉蝣
如此渺小的你我
人間無常的變奏
只想每一刻    給你溫柔 

又是什麼因果
前世千次的錯過
換來一刻的回眸  
終於讓此生   曾經有你   患難與共

｜如果你   記得我
｜你和我   曾走過
｜走過擁有你的此生   別無所求 

｜如果你   忘了我   
｜就讓風   代替我
｜為你寫下這首情歌   陪著你走    

｜陪你走過朝霞星空   天長地久
｜陪著你走

Poetry of The Day After....

青春之後，後悔之前，我依然用力的活著!
Mayday05:07一生一次的傷停補時，一期一會的勇氣之詩



第一首詩 ★突然好想你
作品裡最溫柔的一首遺憾，比不知道能發給誰簡訊更遺憾！

〔...為何我們 還是要奔向各自的幸福和遺憾中老去...〕
最美愛情最痛回憶最遺憾的""第二波""溫柔抒情主打歌＜突然好想你＞，由阿信作詞作曲。最擅長深入淺出表現情感深度的阿信，這次寫出了現任的幸福，和初戀的遺憾，交相對比的深刻情感。
歌曲中間奏未完而緊接上的橋段：""我們，那麼甜、那麼美、那麼相信...""，節奏緊湊，迅速帶出初戀最深的傷痛，然後旋律、歌詞、樂器合鳴，隨著一個個拍點的轉強，一股遺憾自然共鳴，最適合當作有深刻初戀，而今幸福甜美的人們的主題曲。

　五月天 1st 抒情主打 [ 後來的我們 ] MV：https://youtu.be/pd3eV-SG23E


=================================================

後來就沒有我們了，就像那是一個被淘汰的舊軟體、被新的程式取代；後來就沒有我們了，就像那是一份過期的日曆、失去了意義。

從複數被分割成兩個單獨存在的主詞，他們謹慎地挑選著字眼，有意或無意地透露你的消息。你的名字還那麼親暱地溜進我的耳朵裡，叫醒所有微涼的雨季和泛紅的曬傷；沒有「後來的我們」、只有「過去的我們」，而「過去的我們」各自走成了現在的你、我。

這是一首不存在的歌曲，你如此快樂、我捨不得你聽見傷心的歌；這是一段不存在的喃喃自語，你如此快樂、不應該感覺到我的遺憾。偶爾，偶爾我會想起當時，
我笑著說：「沒關係。」
好讓後來的你能放心，和我，沒有關係。


………………………………

後來的我們


然後呢
他們說你的心  似乎痊癒了
也開始有個人  為你守護著
我該心安或是  心痛呢？

然後呢
其實我的日子  也還可以呢  
除了回憶肆虐  的某些時刻
慶幸還有眼淚  沖淡苦澀

而那些昨日  依然繽紛著  它們都有我  細心收藏著
也許你還記得  也許你都忘了
也不是那麼  重要了

只期待  後來的你  能快樂
那就是  後來的我  最想的  
後來的我們  依然走著
只是不再並肩了
朝各自的人生  追尋了

無論是  後來故事  怎麼了
也要讓  後來人生  精彩著
後來的我們  我期待著
淚水中能看到  你真的  自由了

親愛的
回憶我們共同  走過的曲折
是那些帶我們  來到了這一刻
讓珍貴的人生  有失有得

用新的幸福  把遺憾包著  就這麼朝著  未來前進了
有再多的不捨  也要狠心割捨
「別回頭看我  親愛的」

只期待  後來的你  能快樂
那就是  後來的我  最想的  
後來的我們  依然走著
只是不再並肩了
朝各自的人生  追尋了

無論是  後來故事  怎麼了
也要讓  後來人生  精彩著
後來的我們  我期待著
淚水中能看到  你真的  幸福快樂

「在某處  另一個你  留下了」
「在那裡  另一個我  微笑著」
另一個我們  還深愛著
代替我們永恆著
「如果能這麼想  就夠了」

無論是  後來故事  怎麼了
也要讓  後來人生  值得
後來的我們  我期待著
淚水中能看到  你真的  自由了

五月天 

我不願 讓你一個人

作詞：阿信
作曲：阿信+冠佑
編曲：五月天+周恆毅

你說呢 明知你不在 還是會問
空氣 卻不能代替你 出聲
習慣 像永不癒合 的固執傷痕
一思念就撕裂靈魂

把相片 讓你能保存 多洗一本
毛衣 也為你準備多 一層
但是 你孤單時刻 安慰的體溫
怎麼為你多留一份


我不願讓你一個人 一個人在人海浮沉
我不願你獨自走過 風雨的 時分
我不願讓你一個人 承受這世界的殘忍
我不願眼淚陪你到 永恆

你走後 愛情的遺跡 像是空城
遺落你杯子手套和 笑聲
最後 你只帶走你 脆弱和單純
和我最放不下的人
也許未來 你會找到 懂你疼你 更好的人
下段旅程 你一定要 更幸福豐盛

我不願讓你一個人 一個人在人海浮沉
我不願你獨自走過 風雨的 時分
我不願讓你一個人 承受這世界的殘忍
我不願眼淚陪你到 永恆

你說呢 明知你不在 還是會問
只因 習慣你滿足的 眼神
只是 我最後一個 奢求的可能
只求你有快樂人生

只求命運 帶你去一段 全新的旅程
往幸福的天涯飛奔
別回頭就往前飛奔
請忘了我還 一個人",False,False,25509092.0,Not Found

作詞：阿信 / 蔡依林
作曲：剃刀蔣／蔡依林

誰把誰的靈魂 裝進誰的身體
誰把誰的身體 變成囹圄囚禁自己
亂世總是最 不缺耳語
哪種美麗會 換來妒忌
你並沒有罪 有罪的是這世界

生而為人無罪 你不需要抱歉
One day I will be you baby boy, and you gon'be me
喧嘩如果不停 讓我陪你安靜
I wish I could hug you, till you're really really being free

｜哪朵玫瑰沒有荊棘
｜最好的 報復是 美麗
｜最美的 盛開是 反擊
｜別讓誰去 改變了你
｜你是你 或是妳 都行
｜會有人 全心的 愛你

試著想像 you switched to his body
Sexuality 當心什麼會傷你
多少次的重傷 多少次的冷語
Drowning 誰會拉你
Dreaming 誰會陪你
Same shit happens every day
你離開後 世界可改變
多少無知罪愆 事過不境遷
永誌不忘紀念 往事不如煙

｜玫瑰少年 在我心裡
｜綻放著 鮮豔的 傳奇
｜我們都 從來沒 忘記
｜你的控訴 沒有聲音
｜卻傾訴 更多的 真理
｜卻喚醒 無數的 真心

倔強
詞曲 阿信
編曲 五月天
導演 #丹修一

當　我和世界不一樣　那就讓我不一樣　堅持對我來說　就是以剛克剛
我　如果對自己妥協　如果對自己說謊　即使別人原諒　我也不能原諒

最美的願望　一定最瘋狂　我就是我自己的神　在我活的地方

我和我最後的倔強　握緊雙手絕對不放
下一站是不是天堂　就算失望不能絕望

我和我驕傲的倔強　我在風中大聲的唱
這一次為自己瘋狂　就這一次　我和我的倔強
(就這一次  讓我大聲唱 啦啦啦...)

對　愛我的人別緊張　我的固執很善良　我的手越骯髒　眼神越是發光
你　不在乎我的過往　看到了我的翅膀　你說被火燒過　才能出現鳳凰

逆風的方向　更適合飛翔　我不怕千萬人阻擋　只怕自己投降

其實妳　是個心狠又手辣　的小偷
我的心　我的呼吸和名字　都偷走
你才是　綁架我的兇手　
機車後座的我　吹著風　逃離了平庸
這星球　天天有五十億人　在錯過
多幸運　有妳一起看星星　在爭寵
這一刻　不再問為什麼　
不再去猜測人和人　心和心　有什麼不同
｜一二三　牽著手　四五六　抬起頭
｜七八九　我們私奔到月球
｜讓雙腳　去騰空　讓我們　去感受
｜那無憂的真空　那月色純真的感動
當妳說　太聰明往往還是　會寂寞
我笑著　傾聽孤單終結後　的靜默
看月亮　像夜空的瞳孔　
靜靜凝視你我　和我們　擾攘的星球
靠近妳　怎麼突然兩個人　都詞窮
讓心跳　像是野火燎原般　的洶湧
這一刻　讓命運也沉默　
讓腳尖劃過天和天　地和地　緣分的宇宙

青春之後，後悔之前，我依然用力的活著!
Mayday05:07一生一次的傷停補時，一期一會的勇氣之詩



第三首詩 ★你不是真正的快樂
最割人心的第一癒療系主打歌，弦樂前奏第一個音符一下，直到最後一個音符嘎然而止後一秒，淚，才掉下

〔...你不是真正的快樂  你的笑只是你穿的保護色...〕
最割人心最難癒合最秘密第一波愛情癒療主打歌＜你不是真正的快樂＞，聽到彷若內傷深處的弦樂前奏第一個音符一下，馬上被吸入無法自己的內心漩渦，進入一個屬於自己，也屬於每個人的失戀故事中。
歌曲一邊進行，回憶一邊繼續，到歌曲尾奏，與前奏一樣的音符再次一下，彷若失戀傷痛再度輪迴，一遍一遍的刺痛著不肯離去。

你的神曲
詞 / 曲：五月天 阿信
演唱 / 演奏：五月天

｜喔噢噢噢噢噢   我們要大聲唱
｜噢噢噢噢     展開你的翅膀
｜你的神曲開唱
｜唱出你  一生有多狂   活得多漂亮

用力愛過一場   用力拼過一場
那一首歌   才會如此難忘

陪你披荊斬棘   陪你乘風破浪
多年以後   還是少年模樣

｜喔噢噢噢噢噢   我們要大聲唱
｜噢噢噢噢    我就在你身旁
｜你的神曲開唱
｜唱到你  老到撐拐杖  還拿螢光棒

｜喔噢噢噢噢噢   我們要大聲唱
｜噢噢噢噢     展開你的翅膀
｜你的神曲開唱
｜唱出你  一生有多狂   活得多漂亮

不是毫髮無傷   才能蕩氣回腸
不致命的  都叫皮肉之傷

運氣就像抽獎   勇氣才是日常
滿血復活   王者重回戰場

｜喔噢噢噢噢噢   我們要大聲唱
｜噢噢噢噢    我就在你身旁
｜你的神曲開唱
｜唱到你  老到撐拐杖  還拿螢光棒

｜喔噢噢噢噢噢   我們要大聲唱
｜噢噢噢噢     展開你的翅膀
｜你的神曲開唱
｜唱出你  一生有多狂   活得多漂亮

用力愛過一場   用力拼過一場

As an irresistible force of social and cultural change, Berry Gordy's legendary Motown made its mark not just on the music industry, but society at large, with a sound that has become one of the most significant musical accomplishments and stunning success stories of the 20th century. Diana Ross & the Supremes, Smokey Robinson & the Miracles, Stevie Wonder, the Temptations, the Four Tops, Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson & the Jackson 5, the Marvelettes, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Lionel Richie & the Commodores, Teena Marie, their music communicated and brought together a racially divided country and segregated society, around the world, touching all people of all ages and races.

Songwriters: Wasner, Pete; Gill, Vince;

The face of an angel, pretty eyes that shine
I lie awake at night wishing you were mine
I'm standing here holding the biggest heartache in town
Whenever you come around

I get weak in the knees and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come I'm so scared to death
And when you smile that smile, the world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

And I feel so helpless I feel just like a kid
What is it about you that makes me keep my feelings hid
I wish I could tell you, bu the words can't be found
Whenever you come around


I get weak in the knees and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come I'm so scared to death
And when you smile that smile, the world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

I get weak in the knees and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come I'm so scared to death
And when you smile that smile, the world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

And when you smile that smile
The whole world turns upside down

Lyrics:
[GZA]
An MC stepped to me, lying about one
Kid that rolled with him who died in the outcome
Thinking he could get with me, gain victory
When the season's all on his beef was hickory
The situation at hand still remained critical
The check analytical, reaction was pitiful
He pushed his pawn up, yo that's a wrong move
A hog move, some rap cat on dog food
Microphone competition we devour
You pull plugs but take no source of power
Cause then in MCing, the contours of the land
Intricate architects that's linked to a plan
The W U hyphen T A N G
My rap flow automatic and never empty
Don't tempt me, quick to bust off another
Flee in that direction you could get it from my brother
At least then you know that you up against G-O-D
So when we throw those grenades you better be
Ready, not iced out and petty
Neckful couldn't match one oil drop from Getty
That's ran by the icon who just left Exxon
And spilled oil so he could cash checks on
The strength cause local niggas be hating
But the sound still travels from state to state and
No dress code, boot, hats and all metal
Strictly hip hop underground and all ghetto
So catch it, throw it on your plate and scratch it
Mix that [shit], y'all niggas can't do [shit]

[Chorus 2X: Governor Two's]
Stick it up like it's a highway robbery
True gangstas we run New York City
We come fi takeover the industry
Cause you know them have fi too 'fraid of we

[GZA]
How come so much rap [shit] sound so similar
Is it confusing for you to remember the
Originator, paint sprayer, crafts innovators
Quick close ups of the artform's life savors
From tapes to decks, beats with raps, streets with gats
Speaking of tracks, I've ran plenty laps
The crates were packed, Farms were Phat
Thieves would chat to stab my back, detect many traps
Hazardous enterprise, the youths energized
Not seeing the truth till it's in your eyes
Burning, you learning to power your rhyme
Exert maximum damage in minimum time
Road L's are lit, my spears start to hit
Strange translation of words of wit
Through the cable transmit' and once the shoe fit
Unlock the secret of prophecies and that's it
Stay submerged deep as we cruise the seas
Beneath the Surface just like Adidas and Lee's
Or a croke head that used to walked the length
From Brooklyn to get a beat on 43rd and 10th
And that's just a short trip to flip without a whip
Tried to shop this most extravagant gift
To a cat who wasn't hemped and never opened doors
Till he accidently seen it on the shelves of stores
That's more frightning than strikes of lightning
Tearing up the storm in your average college dorm
So think about it when you trying to flow
When you wanna step to us I think you should know

GZA | Duel of the Iron Mic ・Nomen X Edit

In the fabled lore of the Shaolin street sagas, one chamber rests at the pinnacle:

I judge wisely…
As if nothing ever surprise me
Lounging between two pillars of ivory…

-Killah Priest (4th Chamber)-

The critically acclaimed “Liquid Swords” starring the Genius/GZA & his Wu brethren, destroyed all competition in November of ‘95. 
Perhaps due to the release date, or simply the atmosphere of the album, I’ve always associated Liquid Swords with the wintertime.  Whereas Raekwon’s OB4CL is colored by reds & yellows, Liquid Sword’s are ethereal shades of blue. 
Much like the aforementioned OB4CL album & Mobb Deep’s The Infamous, 1995 was the year I played Liquid Swords to death. 
Deconstructing such a timeless classic, required a faithful interpretation to the original vision. I flashbacked to the days being a teenager, driving through the city with my people, with Liquid Swords providing the soundtrack to our criminology ways.
In honor of this flawless gem (Liquid Swords), the Japan-based producer Nomen X, along with Mystic City Assassins, is proud to present the ""Duel of the Iron Mic - Nomen X Edit."" 

From the classic album Liquid Swords [1995]

Od premiery “Muzyki Komercyjnej” minęły 3 tygodnie. Album w tym czasie zdążył osiągnąć status złotej płyty, zadebiutować na 1. miejscu listy sprzedaży OLiS oraz zagrzać miejsce w topce słuchalności w serwisach streamingowych. Wkrótce startuje BUSINESS CLASS TOUR - trasa koncertowa promująca nowy album Pezeta.

""Muzyka Komercyjna"" to story o sukcesie, pieniądzach, miłości na sprzedaż, upadku, mieście, w którym mieszkam, kraju, w którym żyję, banałach które paradoksalnie są najistotniejsze i rzeczach wielkich, które są nieważne, a wydają się mieć największe znaczenie.

""Muzyka Komercyjna"" to historia o muzyce rapowej na sprzedaż, ale również o tym, że wszechobecne i bardzo powszechne dziś przesuwanie granic, zarówno w warstwie estetycznej jak i marketingowej, to jest coś co przestało się mieścić w moich subiektywnych ramach dobrego smaku. - tak o swoim nowym albumie mówi Pezet.

Synopsis:
What happens when you throw two guys who hate each other together...

A cool call center executive Jimmy Cliff (Saif Ali Khan), a desi wannabe gangster Bachchan Pande (Akshay Kumar) add for good measure a beautiful girl Pooja (Kareena Kapoor) who cant be trusted... on a journey across spectacular India... a journey which will alter the course of their lives in more ways than one... a journey where even enemies need to trust each other if they want to stay alive...

Trouble is, in this world no one can be trusted ever!

And to top it all there is the evil eye of Bhaiyyaji (Anil Kapoor - Slumdog Millionaire & 24)... a maverick gangster who enjoys killing people as much as he enjoys learning to speak English...

Synopsis:
Choices... to choose between right or wrong is simple, but what defines one's life is the decision between the greater of two goods or the lesser of two evils. This is the advice that Zooni Ali Beg (Kajol) receives from her father just as she is about to venture out into the world of her own for the very first time. Little does she know that these very words will shape her life.

Zooni, a blind Kashmiri girl, meets Rehan Qadri (Aamir Khan), a local Delhi tour guide and an incorrigible flirt. Her friends warn her against this good-for-nothing roadside Romeo, but she chooses to ignore them. It is now her time to discover life and love. Is this really the right choice?

Rehan is fascinated by Zooni and wants her to see life as it should be seen, in its many colours. He promises her that the time spent with him will be the most precious in all her life. Zooni sees Delhi, life and love like she never has before, because of Rehan.

What Zooni doesn't know is that Rehan has another side of his life that he has kept from her - something that can not only change her life, but can also destroy it.

Mestre, eu preciso de um milagre
Transforma minha vida, meu estado
Faz tempo que eu não vejo a luz do dia
Estão tentando sepultar minha alegria
Tentando ver meus sonhos cancelados

Lázaro ouviu a Sua voz
Quando aquela pedra removeu
Depois de quatro dias ele reviveu
Mestre, não há outro que possa fazer
Aquilo que só o Teu nome tem todo poder
Eu preciso tanto de um milagre

Remove a minha pedra, me chama pelo nome
Muda a minha história
Ressuscita os meus sonhos
Transforma a minha vida, me faz um milagre
Me toca nessa hora, me chama para fora
Ressuscita-me

Tu És a própria vida, a força que há em mim
Tu És o Filho de Deus

REFINADOR
Versão Original: Maverick City Music feat. Chandler Moore & Steffany Gretzinger
Composição: Chandler Moore
Tradução: Bianca Azevedo, Fabiano Brymer, Ricardo Robortella

Se no altar eu te encontro
Leva-me, leva-me 
Se procuras uma oferta
Eis-me aqui, toma-me
Eu serei um vivo sacrifício a Ti
És o fogo que refina, vem me consumir

Pelo fogo quero ser provado
Purificado
Entrego o que sou a Ti
Senhor eis-me aqui
(2x)

Manifesto tua glória
Vem derramar, eu quero mais
Com teu fogo me consome
Vem queimar este altar
Eu serei um vivo sacrifício a Ti
És o fogo que refina, vem me consumir

Pelo fogo quero ser provado
Purificado
Entrego o que sou a Ti
Senhor eis-me aqui
(2x)

Vem limpar minhas mãos
E o meu coração
Quero queimar por Ti
E só por Ti
Aqui estou
Sacrifício sou
Quero queimar por Ti
E só por Ti
(x4)

És o fogo que refina, vem me consumir
És o fogo que refina, vem me consumir

Vem limpar minhas mãos
E o meu coração
Quero queimar por Ti
E só por Ti
Aqui estou
Sacrifício sou
Quero queimar por Ti
E só por Ti

CASA DO PAI

Me conheces, sabes tudo o que eu preciso
Antes mesmo de falar
Me amas, Teu amor é bem maior
Do que eu possa imaginar

Não quero ser só apenas o Teu servo
Quero atrair Teu olhar de amor, Senhor
Eu venho a Ti como um filho que Te ama
Tudo o que eu quero é estar perto de Ti

Nos Teus braços eu quero descansar
Correndo irei pra Te abraçar, meu Pai

Tu és a minha herança, meu Pai
Razão da minha vida, meu Pai
Tudo o que eu preciso está em Ti
Eu quero estar na casa do Pai
Comer em Tua mesa, meu Pai
Tudo o que eu sou é para Ti
Vivo só pra Ti

Compositores: Josué Godoi e Pr. Lucas

===============================
O DVD Extraordinária Graça reúne os grandes sucessos dos álbuns Graça e Extraordinário Amor de Deus. Uma mega produção gravada no HSBC Arena, no Rio de Janeiro. 

""Meu coração se alegra com tudo que aconteceu e só tenho motivos para agradecer a Deus. Está tudo lindo e maravilhoso. Deus fez algo extraordinário. A graça dEle superabundou naquele lugar sobre as nossas vidas e em tudo que aconteceu. Vocês vão provar, experimentar de algo tremendo e poderoso através deste trabalho, desse DVD, das imagens, das canções..."", comentou Aline Barros com euforia. E não era para menos. Foram dois anos sonhando e trabalhando no desenvolvimento no projeto junto com a diretora artística, Marina de Oliveira e do seu marido e diretor executivo, Gilmar Santos, buscando o que existia de mais moderno no mercado. Ruben di Souza assinou arranjos e produção musical.

Alguns números (bem, mas bem altos) dão uma ideia da dimensão do projeto: 1.080m2 de palco, 360m2 de led, 8 toneladas em estrutura e equipamento de luz, mais de 300 profissionais envolvidos em 7 dias de montagem. ""Foram meses trabalhando na realização deste DVD. Desde a seleção do repertório, escolha dos profissionais, desenvolvimento de computação gráfica, estudo de palco e cenografia, concepção de figurino, produção musical, ensaios, muitos ensaios... Foram tantos detalhes, tanto tempo investido que as pessoas não fazem ideia quando conferem o resultado. Mas, pra glória de Deus, tudo foi realizado conforme a vontade dEle. Nosso maior objetivo é através do 'visual' atrair vidas para serem abençoadas com as ministrações"", compartilha Marina de Oliveira. 

Grandes sucessos como ""Ressuscita-me"", ""Casa do Pai"", ""Vitória no Deserto"" e ""Lugar Seguro"" estão presentes no repertório, claro. Como também uma regravação emocionante do clássico cristão ""Porque Ele Vive"". A participação de Bruna Karla e Fernandinho em ""Rendido Estou"" é um dos pontos altos do projeto. 

Aline Barros usou quatro figurinos diferentes e preparou um momento bem especial para a canção ""Santo"": mapping (projeção de imagens mapeadas) em um longo vestido branco - instante de adoração e contrição com interpretação emocionante. E ainda foi acompanhada pelo Grupo de Dança Mudança (da Comunidade Evangélica Internacional da Zona Sul, onde congrega com toda sua família) em ""Profetas dessa Geração"" e ""Teus Pra Sempre"". A cenografia e light design foram assinados por Marcelo Cordeiro (Mattoso), direção de gravação por Anselmo Troncoso e direção executiva por Gilmar Santos e MK Music, que disponibilizou todo seu staff. O DVD EXTRAORDINÁRIA GRAÇA marcou definitivamente a carreira de Aline Barros. É ver para crer e ser abençoado...

JEOVÁ JIREH
Composição: Samuel Messias
Intérprete: Aline Barros

O fogo não me queima
Nas águas não vou afundar
Pois estás comigo
Não estou sozinho

Eu estou guardado
No esconderijo
Não estou sozinho
Tu estás comigo

Temer por quê?
Se eu estou guardado
Por quem nunca perdeu batalhas
Seu nome é
Jeová Jireh
Irás prover de novo
Eu creio em Ti

Haja o que houver
Venha o que vier
Irás prover de novo
Eu creio em Ti

Eu não vivo do que vejo
Vivo do que creio
Irás prover de novo
Eu creio em Ti

A tempestade
E o Vento Forte
Não vão roubar a minha fé
Em Ti meu Deus

Letra:
Tentaram me parar, me fazer desistir
Mas eu não vou negar a fé que há em mim
Eu tenho a missão, eu vou seguir Jesus
Porque eu não abro mão do evangelho da Cruz
 
Mesmo que pedras venham contra mim
E com palavras queiram me intimidar
Maior é Aquele que está em mim
Com Jesus sempre vou me levantar
 
Eu olho pra Jesus, pro amor de Deus na Cruz
Eu clamo Aba Pai, oh vem com Seu poder
Eu olho pra Jesus, pro amor de Deus na Cruz
Nada pode parar o Autor da Vida
 
Mesmo que pedras venham contra mim
E com palavras queiram me intimidar
Maior é Aquele que está em mim
Com Jesus sempre vou me levantar
 
Eu olho pra Jesus, pro amor de Deus na Cruz
Eu clamo Aba Pai, oh vem com Seu poder
Eu olho pra Jesus, pro amor de Deus na Cruz
Nada pode parar o Autor da Vida
 
Pode o silêncio até gritar que Deus me abandonou
Eu vivo pela fé e tenho um Deus que estende a mão
Pra me levantar
Sei em quem eu tenho crido e que é poderoso
Pra fazer além
E essa é a hora, Deus toca, renova
Transforma, tenho vida em Deus, vida em Deus
Tenho força em Deus
Esperança em Deus
Tenho tudo em Deus
 
Eu olho pra Jesus, pro amor de Deus na Cruz
Eu clamo Aba Pai, oh vem com Seu poder
Eu olho pra Jesus, pro amor de Deus na Cruz
Nada pode parar o Autor da Vida

Julia Vitoria e Aline Barros apresentam ""Ele Vem"", single que tem a participação especial do coral One Service Project - que também esteve presente em ""Além do Rio Azul"". Este projeto de Julia busca resgatar algumas raízes da música cristã brasileira, por isso, a cantora incluiu um trecho de ""A Cidade Santa"", canção que esteve no primeiro LP de Aline Barros. 

Entre suas faixas mais conhecidas estão: ""De Dentro pra Fora"", ""Tu És Santo"" - com Isadora Pompeo -  e ""Tuas Águas"" - com Gabriela Rocha. Já, Aline Barros, tem em seu repertório sucessos como: ""Autor da Vida"", ""Ressuscita-me"" e ""Sonda-me"".

▸ Letra:

Já posso ouvir os céus cantando
A terra clama pela Sua vinda
Minha alma anseia o nosso encontro
Ele vem, Ele vem

Seus olhos são como de fogo
E os Seus cabelos brancos como a neve
Eu O verei face a face
Ele vem, Ele vem

Ele vem saltando sobre os montes
Ele vem buscar a Sua noiva
Ora vem, Senhor Jesus
Ora vem, Senhor Jesus

Ele vem saltando sobre os montes
Ele vem com toda a Sua glória
Ora vem, Senhor Jesus
Ora vem, Senhor Jesus

Jerusalém, Jerusalém
Cantai, ó Santa Grei
Hosana nas alturas
Hosana ao nosso Rei

Corra para os Braços do Pai (If This World) 
Composição: E. Tyler Hayes / Eric Sundred / Mark James Heimermann / Michelle L Tumes / Aline Barros
Intérprete: Aline Barros

Na na na na na na na na na na na na ohhhhh yeh

São tantas desilusões
E você já não sabe o que fazer
Sofrendo decepções
Se sentindo sozinho
Sem direção
Chora teu coração
A dor dessa solidão
Sem rumo pra caminhar.
Sem resposta pra essa situação oh oh

Esse mundo não tem mais direção
Corra para os braços do Pai
Se você não encontra a solução
Deixe Cristo te guiar
Ele sim te completará

Na na na na na na na na na na na na ohhhhh yeh

Não fique tão triste assim
Pois eu sei que há um Rei
Que te quer demais
Você vai poder sentir
Esse amor, essa paz
No seu interior
Ponha tua Fé em Jesus
Ouça a voz do seu coração
Pegue nas mãos do senhor
E caminhe sempre com proteção oh oh
Esse mundo não tem mais direção
Corra para os braços do Pai
Se você não encontra a solução
Deixe Cristo te guiar
Ele sim te completará

Na na na na na na na na na na na na ohhhhh yeh

Entregue agora o coração
Ao Rei Jesus o Salvador
Pois Ele te abençoará
Suas Promessas herdará
E então feliz tu viverás

Esse mundo não tem mais direção
Corra para os braços do Pai
Se você não encontra a solução
Deixe Cristo te guiar
Ele sim te completará

Na na na na na na na na na na na na ohhhhh yeh

Winterkinder können stundenlang am Fenster stehn

Winterkinder in den Bergen oder an der See,

Sie wollen nicht immer nur durch grauen Nebel schau'n,
sie wollen lieber einen grossen Schneemann bau'n.

Winterkinder können stundenlang am Fenster stehn
und voll Ungeduld hinauf zum Himmel sehn.
Winterkinder in den Bergen oder an der See,
alle warten auf den ersten Schnee.

Sie träumen von Schlittschuhlaufen und der Rodelbahn
und davon, endlich wieder Schuss ins Tal zu fahrn.

________________________


Ich leb alleine schon viele Jahre
Das Leben stumpf, der Alltag grau
Verlier Geduld, Verstand und Haare
Ich hätte gerne eine Frau

Und die Hoffnung will mir schwinden
Eine Partnerin zu finden
Die mir ebenbürtig ist
Nein, da ist kein Glück in Sicht

Sie muss nicht schön sein
Sie muss nicht klug sein
Nein
Sie muss nicht reich sein
Kein Model mit langen Schritten
Doch dicken Titten

Wie eine stetig offene Wunde
Aus der Seele tropft das Blut
Einzig Trost sind kleine Hunde
Ein feines Fräulein wäre gut

Ein feines Fräulein wäre toll
Ich bin auch gar nicht anspruchsvoll
Ich bin auch gar nicht wählerisch
Am Ende der Geschicht

Muss sie nicht schön sein
Sie muss nicht klug sein
Nein
Sie muss nicht reich sein
Doch um eines möchte ich bitten
Dicke Titten

Ich bin auch gar nicht anspruchsvoll
Doch große Brüste wären toll

Sie muss nicht schön sein
Sie muss nicht klug sein
Sie muss nur reich sein
An Fettgewebe bitte, bitte
Sie wird nichts bei mir vermissen
Sie braucht mich auch gar nicht küssen
Braucht mich nicht mit Trauben laben
Sie muss nur Riesentitten haben

Dicke Titten

Rammstein are one of rock’s most individual and successful names, a multiple award-winning outfit with a vision that continues to evolve. Since forming in 1994, the six East Berliners have headlined the world’s major festivals and stadiums, selling millions of albums, and topping charts worldwide.

For the Rammstein kollektiv, and it’s the same line-up now as at the start, it’s always been a case of marching to their own beat; they sing in German, side-step those visuals typical of the metal world, and present an incendiary live experience that touches all of the senses – an experience underpinned by cultural and artistic weight.

To date, there are seven studio albums under the Rammstein banner, the most recent being 2019’s untitled release – a body of work that headed the charts in 14 countries and went Top 10 in the US, breaking new ground. Produced by the band with Olsen Involtini, this 11-tracker (double platinum in Germany) was preceded by lead single ‘Deutschland’, a domestic No. 1 supported by a nine-minute movie – an epic, unflinching look at German history directed by Specter Berlin.

Not only was this album a decade in the making, it also saw the musicians taking their legendary live show into Stadiums, selling 800,000 tickets immediately and eventually playing to over 1.2 million fans across 17 countries.

The next leg of the European Stadium Tour takes place in spring / summer 2021, with most venues sold out.

Wenn die Kinder unerzogen
Schon der Vater hat gedroht
Der schwarze Mann, er wird dich holen
Wenn du nicht folgst meinem Gebot

Und das glauben wir bis heute
So in Angst sind Land und Leute
Etwas Schlimmes wird geschehen
Das Böse kommt, wird nicht mehr gehen

Und die Furcht wächst in die Nacht
Tür und Tore sind bewacht
Die Rücken nass, die Hände klamm
Alle haben Angst vorm schwarzen Mann

In Dunkelheit schleicht er heran
Bist du nicht brav, fasst er dich an
Traue keinem Fremden dann
So viel Albtraum, so viel Wahn

Und so glauben wir bis heute
Schwer bewaffnet ist die Meute
Ach, sie können es nicht lassen
Schreien Feuer in die Gassen

Und die Furcht wächst in die Nacht
Gar kein Auge zugemacht
Der Rücken nass, die Hände klamm
Alle haben Angst vorm schwarzen Mann

Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann
Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann
Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann
Wer hat Angst

Und die Furcht wächst in die Nacht
Gar kein Auge zugemacht
Die Rücken nass, die Hände klamm
Alle haben Angst

Schwarzer Mann
Schwarzer Mann

The official 'Bohemian Rhapsody' music video. Taken from Queen - 'Greatest Video Hits 1'. Lyrics below:

Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo - (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go - will you let me go
Bismillah! No - we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let me go
Will not let you go - let me go (never)
Never let you go - let me go
Never let me go - ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no -
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
for me
for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby - can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters - nothing really matters to me

Anyway the wind blows...
