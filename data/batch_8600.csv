Pais e Filhos
Legião Urbana
-

Estátuas e cofres e paredes pintadas
Ninguém sabe o que aconteceu.
Ela se jogou da janela do quinto andar
Nada é fácil de entender.

Dorme agora,
é só o vento lá fora.

Quero colo! Vou fugir de casa!
Posso dormir aqui com vocês?
Estou com medo, tive um pesadelo
Só vou voltar depois das três.

Meu filho vai ter nome de santo
Quero o nome mais bonito.

É preciso amar as pessoas
Como se não houvesse amanhã
Porque se você parar pra pensar
Na verdade não há.

Me diz, por que que o céu é azul?
Explica a grande fúria do mundo
São meus filhos
Que tomam conta de mim.

Eu moro com a minha mãe
Mas meu pai vem me visitar
Eu moro na rua, não tenho ninguém
Eu moro em qualquer lugar.

Já morei em tanta casa
Que nem me lembro mais
Eu moro com os meus pais.

É preciso amar as pessoas
Como se não houvesse amanhã
Porque se você parar pra pensar
Na verdade não há.

Sou uma gota d'água,
sou um grão de areia
Você me diz que seus pais não te entendem,
Mas você não entende seus pais.

Você culpa seus pais por tudo, isso é absurdo
São crianças como você
O que você vai ser,
Quando você crescer?",False,False,88126588.0,alternative rock

Letra: “Sin Principio Ni Final” (Abel Pintos)

Te vuelves parte de mi ser en mis palabras 
Estás aquí tocando el centro de mi alma 
Como un eclipse sin final de sol y luna 
Como lo eterno del amor en una alianza. 
Podría hacer que el mar se junte con el cielo 
Para lograr la inmensidad que hay en el vuelo 
Que me regalan tu mirada y tu desvelo 
Bajo la luna cuando danzas en mis sueños. 
Te voy a amar y me amarás 
Te amo sin principio ni final 
Y es nuestro gran amor 
Mi ángel de la eternidad. 
Te voy a amar y me amarás 
Te amo y es mi única verdad 
Y es nuestro gran amor 
Lo que nunca morirá. 
La noche brilla con tu luz en la distancia 
Tu imagen reina y es su brillo el que me alcanza 
Me elevo en cada movimiento de tu sombra 
Que baila cada vez que mi canción te nombra 
Quizá esta vida se termine dando cuenta 
Que es ella solo un momento de esta historia 
Porque este amor no tiene tiempos ni fronteras 
Porque este amor va más allá de mi existencia. 
Te voy a amar y me amarás 
Te amo sin principio ni final 
Y es nuestro gran amor 
Mi ángel de la eternidad. 
Te voy a amar y me amarás 
Te amo y es mi única verdad 
Y es nuestro gran amor 
Lo que nunca morirá. 
Te voy a amar y me amarás 
Te amo y es mi única verdad 
Y es nuestro gran amor 
Lo que nunca morirá.

Letra: ''Oncemil"" (Abel Pintos-Ariel Pintos-Diego Canteros)

No me gusta herir a quien amo, 
No me gusta traer el pasado, 
Aquí, al presente, 
No me gusta sentirme ausente 
Cuando tú vives a mi lado. 

No me gusta matar las horas, 
Sonreír si no soy feliz, 
Convertirme tan sólo 
En un fantasma amante de todos, 
Vendiéndole el alma al diablo. 

No me gusta vivir así, así... 

Así, como si no doliera, 
Así, como si no estuviera 
Ahogándome en palabras mudas, 
Con las manos duras de arañar la arena. 

Partido en once mil pedazos, 
Callándole la voz del alma a los dos, 
Asumiéndome un caso perdido. 

No me gusta herir a quien amo, 
No me gusta traer el pasado, 
Aquí, al presente, 
No me gusta sentirme ausente 
Cuando tú vives a mi lado. 

No me gusta matar las horas, 
Sonreír si no soy feliz, 
Convertirme tan sólo 
En un fantasma amante de todos, 
Vendiéndole el alma al diablo. 

No me gusta vivir así. 

Así, como si no doliera, 
Así, como si no estuviera 
Ahogándome en palabras mudas, 
Con las manos duras de arañar la arena. 
Partido en once mil pedazos, 
Callándole la voz del alma a los dos, 
Asumiéndome un caso perdido. 

La suma de las dos mitades, 
La lágrima alimenta al río, 
La cura de las vanidades, 
La luz abriéndose camino 
Para dar olvido a las soledades. 

Así, como si no doliera, 
Así, como si no estuviera 
Partido en once mil pedazos, 
Callándole la voz del alma a los dos, 
Asumiéndome un caso perdido.

Letra:
No debemos de pensar que todo es diferente
Mil momentos como este quedan en mi mente
No se piensa en el verano cuando cae la nieve
Deja que pase un momento y volveremos a querernos
Jamás la lógica del mundo nos ha dividido
Ni el futuro tan incierto nos ha preocupado
Una vez, los dos dijimos: ""hay que separarse""
Mas, deshicimos las maletas antes de emprender el viaje

Tú, no podrás faltarme cuando falte todo a mi alrededor
Tú, aire que respiro en aquel paisaje donde vivo yo
Tú, tú me das la fuerza que se necesita para no marchar
Tú me das amor
Tú no podrás faltarme cuando falte todo a mi alrededor
Tú, aire que respiro en aquel paisaje donde vivo yo
Tú, tú me das la fuerza que se necesita para no marchar
Tú me das amor
Tú...

Letra: “Aventura” (Abel Pintos-Ariel Pintos)

Suelo detenerme frente algún espejo 
Porque en el reflejo siempre estás ahí. 
Suelo andar de noche como un vagabundo 
Naufragando ciego en este mar profundo 
De sentirte tanto y no tenerte aquí. 

Te extraño y me siento solo si no estás conmigo 
Aunque vas prendida en todos mis sentidos, 
Todos los rincones de mi pensamiento. 

Te amo, con la vida entera, con el alma mía 
Segundo a segundo, te amo día a día 
Con cada latido de mi sentimiento. 

Quiero que me entiendas todo lo que digo, 
Quiero que lo escuches en esta canción. 
Todo lo que tengo todo lo que vivo 
Ya no vale nada, no tiene sentido 
Si no escucho el brillo de tu dulce voz. 

Te extraño y me siento solo si no estás conmigo 
Aunque vas prendida en todos mis sentidos, 
Todos los rincones de mi pensamiento. 

Te amo, con la vida entera, con el alma mía 
Segundo a segundo, te amo día a día 
Con cada latido de mi sentimiento. 

Ojalá tu abrazo fuera un cielo eterno. 
Ojalá mi mundo terminara en ti. 
Gracias a la vida y a Dios que te tengo 
Y que puedo darte lo mejor de mí.

Te extraño y me siento solo si no estás conmigo 
Aunque vas prendida en todos mis sentidos, 
Todos los rincones de mi pensamiento. 

Te amo, con la vida entera, con el alma mía 
Segundo a segundo, te amo día a día 
Con cada latido de mi sentimiento.

Letra: “No Me Olvides” (Abel Pintos-Ariel Pintos)

El tiempo de alejarme
Me lastima una vez más.
Abrázame un rato
Que no quiero enterarme
Que esta noche va a pasar.
Quiero hacer un pacto.

Seguro vos encuentres
Quien te quiera de verdad,
Pero no me olvides.
Yo voy a estar muy lejos,
Te lo pido por piedad:
Nena, no me olvides.

Si cada despedida
Es una roca sobre el mar,
En este corazón hay muchas piedras.
No voy a arrepentirme
De decirte la verdad,
Cambiaste con tu amor mi vida entera.

El tiempo de alejarme
Me lastima una vez más.
Abrázame un rato
Que no quiero enterarme
Que esta noche va a pasar.
Quiero hacer un pacto.

Seguro vos encuentres
Quien te quiera de verdad,
Porque vos sos libre.
Yo voy a estar pensando
En volver, en regresar.
Nena, no me olvides.

Maldita sea la duda
Y la costumbre de pensar
Que no se puede amar
De esta manera.
Yo vivo en la distancia,
Pero puedo regresar
Y amarte cada noche,
En cada estrella.

Seguro vos encuentres
Quien te quiera de verdad,
Pero no me olvides.
Yo voy a estar pensando
En volver, en regresar.
Nena, no me olvides.

Si cada despedida
Es una roca sobre el mar,
Nena, no me olvides.
Yo vivo en la distancia,
Te lo pido por piedad:
Nena, no me olvides.

El tiempo de alejarme
Me lastima una vez más.
Abrázame un rato.

Letra: “La Llave” (Abel Pintos-Alfredo Hernández)

La soledad se hace carne en mí
Y la noche parece un desierto
Pero llegas tú con tu inmensa luz
Y te declaras dueña de mis sueños

El tiempo viste un color azul
Parecido a un suspiro del cielo
De sólo saber que te voy a ver
Y a regalarte todos mis momentos.

Vas a verme llegar
Vas a oír mi canción
Vas a entrar sin pedirme la llave
La distancia y el tiempo no saben
La falta que le haces a mi corazón.

La soledad se hace carne en mí
Y la noche parece un desierto
Pero llegas tú con tu inmensa luz
Y te declaras dueña de mis sueños.

El tiempo viste un color azul
Parecido a un suspiro del cielo
De sólo saber que te voy a ver
Y a regalarte todos mis momentos.

Vas a verme llegar
Vas a oír mi canción
Vas a entrar sin pedirme la llave
La distancia y el tiempo no saben
La falta que le haces a mi corazón.

Porque puedo callar mis palabras
Y escucharte en el viento hablar
Porque puedo soñar para verte
Y tenerte aún sin soñar.

Vas a verme llegar
Vas a oír mi canción
Vas a entrar sin pedirme la llave
La distancia y el tiempo no saben
La falta que le haces a mi corazón.

Vas a verme llegar
Y vas a oír mi canción
Vas a entrar sin pedirme la llave
La distancia y el tiempo no saben
La falta que le haces a mi corazón.

Letra: “Tanto Amor” (Abel Pintos-Ariel Pintos-David Santisteban)

Ha llegado tu recuerdo a desarmar mis horas, 
Aprendí que en el silencio habita la verdad. 
Sólo vivir no me vale la pena, si la vivo a solas, 
Ya no sé qué decir. Si pudiéramos haber partido en dos 
Esta soledad y el peso del dolor, 
Y si fuimos tú y yo. 
Todo por igual, debería estar 
Compartido el ardor de este frío, 
¿Cómo tanto amor pudo hacernos tanto mal? 
No sé cómo encontrar un rincón en el mar 
Para ahogar la mitad del olvido. 
¿Cómo tanto amor pudo hacernos tanto mal? 
Me desnuda la razón imaginarte sola, 
Deshojando el tiempo para no pensar. 
Mientras, aquí solo, me pregunto si no me arrepiento. 
Ya no sé si es así. 
Si pudiéramos haber partido en dos 
Esta soledad y el peso del dolor, 
Sólo fuimos tú y yo. 
Todo por igual, debería estar 
Compartido el ardor de este frío, 
¿Cómo tanto amor pudo hacernos tanto mal? 
No sé cómo encontrar un rincón en el mar 
Para ahogar la mitad del olvido. 
¿Cómo tanto amor pudo hacernos mal? 
Todo por igual debería estar 
¿Cómo tanto amor pudo hacernos tanto mal? 
No sé cómo encontrar un rincón en el mar 
Para ahogar la mitad del olvido. 
¿Cómo tanto amor, tanto amor, pudo hacernos tanto mal?
 A ti, a mí. A ti, a mí.

Dança Da Mãozinha
( Marcelo Menezes)
Explosão Tchakabum
com a dança do verão
Explosão muito quente
quente feito um vulcão
Explosão nesse
gingado caliente
que tem cheiro de camim
morena tão envolvente
quero você só pra mim
Explosão Tchakabum
com a dança do verão
Explosão muito quente
quente feito um vulcão
Explosão nesse
gingado caliente
que tem cheiro de camim
morena tão envolvente
quero você
mexendo todo esse corpo
rebola quebrando formoso
Como uma cobra rebolare
bola corpo de mola
o caldeirão fervendo
vai entrar em erupção
você vai ver
daqui a pouco
o caldo vai ferver
vai ferver vai ferver
Como uma cobra rebola
rebola corpo de mola
o caldeirão fervendo
vai entrar em erupção
você vai ver
daqui a pouco
o caldo vai ferver
vai ferver vai ferver

Tesouro do Pirata (Onda Onda)
(Marcelo Menezes)

Vou te pegar, essa é a galera do avião
Se ligue agora nessa nova onda
Sou um pirata jogando a marcação, ô ô ô

Vou navegar, cumprindo as ordens do meu capitão
Capitão Tchaka vem dançando com a galera
Nessa aventura que é pura emoção
Olha a onda!

Onda, onda, olha a onda (4x)

Vou te molhar, vou te banhar, vai sacudir vai abalar
Vou te molhar, vou te banhar, vai sacudir vai abalar

Molhou o seu rostinho
Molhou a barriguinha
Molhou o seu pezinho
Molhou todo corpinho deixa que eu vou te enxugar

Balança pra lá, balança pra cá
Sacudiu tremeu, treme sem parar
Balança pra lá, balança pra cá
Sacudiu tremeu, treme sem parar

Capitão mandou
O marujo sim senhor
O capitão mandou
O marujo sim senhor
E o capitão mandou
O marujo sim senhor

Andou na prancha, cuidado o tubarão vai te pegar (4x)

Onda, onda, olha a onda (4x)

Lyrics:
When you get older, plainer, saner
Will you remember all the danger
We came from?
Burning like embers, falling, tender
Longing for the days of no surrender
Years ago
And will you know

So smoke 'em if you got 'em
Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
I'll never get to heaven
Cause I don't know how

Let's raise a glass
Or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Ho, ooh
Tell me are they lost on you?
Ooh, oh
Just that you could cut me loose
Ho, ooh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Hoooooh
Ooh, oh
Hoooooh
Is that lost on you?
Hoooooh
Ooh, oh
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

Wishin' I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations
In your mind
Hold me like you never lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate me
All the time
And you're still mine

So smoke 'em if you got 'em
Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
Let's take a drink of heaven
This can turn around

Let's raise a glass
Or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Ho, oh
Tell me are they lost on you?
Ooh, oh
Just that you could cut me loose
Ho, oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Hoooooh
Ooh, oh
Hoooooh
Is that lost on you?
Hoooooh
Ooh, oh
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

LINE IT UP // LYRICS

I’m feeling like a stranger
‘Cause I’m stuck here
Living like my parents is my worst fear 
They had some kids
And got lost in the suburbs
Working jobs they hated made them suffer

I’d rather die
Than live my fathers life
And pretend like I’m satisfied

So Line It Up for me
Steal away my dreams 
‘Cause I don’t need no sleeping 
When I’m diving off the deep end 
So Line It Up for me
Steal away my dreams 
‘Cause I don’t need no sleeping 
When I’m diving off the deep end 
I’m diving off edge 

Crashing in these secondhand motel rooms 
Driving cross the country ‘cause I want to
I can’t slow down
Because I’m scared to stand still
I can’t go home 
Because it feels like hell

And I’d rather die
Than live my fathers life
And pretend like I’m satisfied

So Line It Up for me
Steal away my dreams 
‘Cause I don’t need no sleeping 
When I’m diving off the deep end 
So Line It Up for me
Steal away my dreams 
‘Cause I don’t need no sleeping 
When I’m diving off the deep end 
I’m diving off edge 

Why should I come back to earth
When all that’s there are tears and hurt? 
There’s absolutely nothing there for me

Diving off the edge feels good
I’m finally not misunderstood
I know that there is no way I can stay
I’d rather die than ever live my life that way
I’d rather die than ever live my life that way

So Line It Up for me
Steal away my dreams
‘Cause I don’t need no sleeping 
When I’m diving off the deep end
So Line It Up for me
Steal away my dreams
‘Cause I don’t need no sleeping 
When I’m diving off the deep end
I’m diving off the edge
I’m diving off the edge
I’m diving off the edge

#LP
#lostonyou
#recovery

Non esistono vie di mezzo, questa volta no! Dopo i primi accordi di LP – Lost On You, fatti di carezze acustiche, e l'ipnotica cassa in quattro, l'orecchio non può rimanere indifferente: sono passati pochi secondi e la voce di LP (al secolo Laura Pergolizzi) vi ha già agganciato come un amo.

Non può esserci rifiuto dopo il morso di LP, il veleno benefico della sua voce rauca è già in circolo, in voi. Esiste solo una tipologia di ascoltatore immune al mantra di LP – Lost On You: chi deve ancora ascoltarla. 

Accompagnata dal suo inseparabile ukulele (prodotto appositamente per lei dalla Martin Guitar, caso unico per un'artista femminile) in Lost On You LP confessa a se stessa e a noi i veri desideri di una vita. 

""Perdersi"" è facile, così come vagare in una nuvola di fumo (elemento ricorrente nel videoclip della canzone), così come ascoltare Lost On You.

LP è nata a Huntington, Long Island (ovvero New York), ma se ve lo stavate chiedendo sì, l'origine italiana è nelle vene da parte di madre napoletana e padre per metà siciliano e metà irlandese.

Classe 1981, LP non ha tempo per le cazzate con cui oggi si (s)vende la musica e gioca quindi a carte scoperte.

Non è un'artista di primo pelo e non vuole abbassare l'età per accattivarsi i like dei teenager. La gavetta l'ha già fatta e i suoi successi li ha fin'ora elargiti a nomi celebri come Rihanna, Rita Ora, Ella Henderson, Cher, Leona Lewis, e Christina Aguilera. Ha classe da vendere.

Omosessuale dichiarata (vedere il videoclip di Lost On You fino all'ultimo frame per credere) LP è diretta e senza filtri come la sua musica. Non ha nulla da nascondere.
L'intimità del folk, l'essenzialità del songwriting, l'asprezza di un'anima rock inespressa eppure latente: questi i punti cardinali di LP. 
Perdetevi.

Lyrics:
There was a time, there was a life, I was inside my head
And finally I rested in your bed
The bars, the dives, the worst of vibes
I thought had come to pass
But still I couldn't seem to make it last
I'd swallow the moon and the stars
To follow the beat of your heart
Oh when we're high
Oh my God, you blow my mind
So let's get high
Live until we die, yeah
You and I, you and I
Let's just do it one more time, one more time
A million times
Let's get high (let's get high)
Live until we die, yeah
A state of mind collected like
A slowly wound bouquet
With memories of our favorite nights and days
Let's swallow the moon and the stars
Let's wallow just right where we are
Oh when we're high
Oh my God, you blow my mind
So let's get high (let's get high)
Live until we die, yeah
Oh you and I (you and I)
Let's just do it one more time, (one more time)
A million times
So let's get high (let's get high)
Live until we die, yeah
Blow my mind
Blow my mind
Oh my, my, kiss the sky
Jimmy, baby, you were right
She's so fine, hips don't lie
Hit me baby one more time
Go 'head and insert any random ass line
Go 'head, yeah, yeah
'Cause when we're high
Oh my God, you blow my mind
So let's get high (let's get high)
Live until we die, yeah
Oh you and I (you and I)
Let's just do it one more time, (one more time)
A million times
So let's get high (let's get high)
Live until we die, yeah, yeah (blow my mind)
Live until we die, yeah

Un grido di gioia selvaggio nel vento, un trasportatore sano di libertà e spensieratezza, il riecheggiare tra le montagne silenziose del meraviglioso stridio di un’aquila. 

Questo è Girls Go Wild, secondo singolo di LP, estratto dal suo nuovo album Heart To Mouth che vanta la collaborazione di Mike Del Rio (Eminem, X-Ambassators, Skylar Gray), e dell’autore Nathaniel Campany. 

Rockstar poliedrica statunitense che con Recovery, primo singolo intimista, intenso e sussurrato, permane ancora in molte chart da Dicembre. 

LP è pronta a tornare in radio con Girls Go Wild, brano immediato che ben si lega al mood primavera-estate ed è pronto ad accompagnarci nel risveglio ormonale e sensoriale che è alle porte. 

“Girls go wild on the west coast, come on baby let’s go” (“Le ragazze impazziscono sulla West Coast, vieni piccola, andiamo”) canta LP nell’inciso, dichiarando apertamente la direzione e l’intenzione del singolo: amore e libertà, due componenti fondamentali nella vita dell’artista.

Vita artistica che, dall’uscita di Lost On You in poi, (il singolo è ad oggi quadruplo disco di platino nel Belpaese) è stato un susseguirsi di soddisfazioni e riconoscimenti prestigiosi: disco di platino in Italia, Francia, Svizzera, Russia, Polonia, Grecia per l’album, videoclip che hanno superato 300 milioni di visualizzazioni, premiata recentemente per il Miglior Live Internazionale ai Rockol Awards 2018 mentre l’anno precedente lo era stata per il miglior album internazionale sempre Rockol Awards e tour mondiale ovunque sold out che continua ad aggiungere date su date per l’enorme richiesta.

E questa nuova fatica discografica, Heart To Mouth, è destinata a eguagliare il precedente lavoro, raccogliendo una varietà di brani in cui l’onda emotiva circuisce i sensi, trasportandoli in stanze concentriche su una danza vocale che, solo un timbro inconfondibile come quello di LP riesce a regalare agli ascoltatori. 

E nel nuovo singolo, Girls Go Wild, LP supera LP in una dichiarazione d’amore senza maschere o timori che ci riporta immediatamente a quel sorriso schietto e trasparente che la caratterizza e che, al di là dell’indiscusso talento, la pone definitivamente nell’olimpo della purezza umana e artistica. 

In Girls Go Wild, LP torna a fischiettare il “motivetto”, quel suo unicum marchio di fabbrica che siamo pronti a seguire ancora e ancora una volta, all’unisono con lei.

Lyrics:

I been caged
I been hounded
I been hunted and tamed.
I’m the outlaw of outside
And ready to rage.

I’m in search of a heart I can eat to renew me
And I’m dazzled by all of the things that undo me.

Girls go wild on the west coast.
Come on baby let’s go.
That’s what she said.
Sunshine brighter than blind love.
It’s all in the name of the wild wild west.

Take my love
Take my soul
You just take what you can.

When we fuck now it feels like you don’t understand.
Tell you what it don’t suck and I need you right now.
You’re the one that I want so I won’t make a sound.

Girls go wild on the west coast.
Come on baby let’s go.
That’s what she said.
Sunshine brighter than blind love.
It’s all in the name of the wild wild west.

I really love you.
You know I really do.
Whatever happens.
I hope you’re happy to.
I really love you.
So what you wanna do?

#lostonyou
#recovery

Non esistono vie di mezzo, questa volta no! Dopo i primi accordi di LP – Lost On You, fatti di carezze acustiche, e l'ipnotica cassa in quattro, l'orecchio non può rimanere indifferente: sono passati pochi secondi e la voce di LP (al secolo Laura Pergolizzi) vi ha già agganciato come un amo.

Non può esserci rifiuto dopo il morso di LP, il veleno benefico della sua voce rauca è già in circolo, in voi. Esiste solo una tipologia di ascoltatore immune al mantra di LP – Lost On You: chi deve ancora ascoltarla. 

Accompagnata dal suo inseparabile ukulele (prodotto appositamente per lei dalla Martin Guitar, caso unico per un'artista femminile) in Lost On You LP confessa a se stessa e a noi i veri desideri di una vita. 

""Perdersi"" è facile, così come vagare in una nuvola di fumo (elemento ricorrente nel videoclip della canzone), così come ascoltare Lost On You.

LP è nata a Huntington, Long Island (ovvero New York), ma se ve lo stavate chiedendo sì, l'origine italiana è nelle vene da parte di madre napoletana e padre per metà siciliano e metà irlandese.

Classe 1981, LP non ha tempo per le cazzate con cui oggi si (s)vende la musica e gioca quindi a carte scoperte.

Non è un'artista di primo pelo e non vuole abbassare l'età per accattivarsi i like dei teenager. La gavetta l'ha già fatta e i suoi successi li ha fin'ora elargiti a nomi celebri come Rihanna, Rita Ora, Ella Henderson, Cher, Leona Lewis, e Christina Aguilera. Ha classe da vendere.

Omosessuale dichiarata (vedere il videoclip di Lost On You fino all'ultimo frame per credere) LP è diretta e senza filtri come la sua musica. Non ha nulla da nascondere.
L'intimità del folk, l'essenzialità del songwriting, l'asprezza di un'anima rock inespressa eppure latente: questi i punti cardinali di LP. 
Perdetevi.

Lyrics:

I never tried to be a hero
You took us from the stars to zero
We had a love devout without a shred of doubt
We never worried 'bout other people
You broke the spell and wanted something else
Well, go fuck yourself with other people
Other people
No more song, no more dance, no dance floor
We left it all to chance, no encore
We had a love devout without a shred of doubt
We never worried 'bout other people
You broke the spell and wanted something else
Well, go fuck yourself with other people
Oh, baby it's just your body
Go, lay it on everybody
They won't be there when you're sorry
Other people
Oh, baby it's just your body
Will it know that you love somebody
Who won't be there when you're sorry?
Other people
Thank you baby, thank you babe
Darling don't explain, don't explain
Thank you baby, thank you babe
Darling don't explain, don't explain
We had a love devout without a shred of doubt
We never worried 'bout other people
You broke the spell and wanted something else
Well, now go fuck yourself with other people
Oh, baby it's just your body
Go, lay it on everybody
They won't be there when you're sorry
Other people
Oh, baby it's just your body
Will it know that you love somebody
Who won't be there when you're sorry?
Other people
Other people
Other people

""Halo"" Lyrics:

Remember those walls I built
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make up a sound

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
Halo, halo

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

#lplostonyou

Dopo il quadruplo disco di platino del primo singolo “Lost On You”, 
il platino di “Other People”, e il platino dell’album “Lost On You”...

LP presenta il nuovo album di inediti HEART TO MOUTH

Apripista: il singolo RECOVERY

“Credo che le canzoni valgano più di tante parole”: non è uno slogan, ma solo un pensiero di LP, alle spalle quattro album in studio, una miriade di concerti (uno dei più recenti, la sua entusiasmante partecipazione alla Notte della Taranta dello scorso agosto, ma anche i palchi di Coachella, Mad Cool, Outisde Lands), un successo che è cresciuto quanto più l’artista statunitense di origine italiana “ha lasciato fare” a se stessa, nell’ispirazione e nelle intenzioni delle canzoni. E' stato così che i video di Lost On You, Muddy Waters, When We’re High sono arrivati a oltre 280 milioni di visualizzazioni in un anno e che l’album Lost On You è diventato disco di platino in Italia, Francia, Svizzera, Russia, Polonia, Grecia. 

Credenziali importanti, che però si potrebbero anche dimenticare ascoltando un nuovo singolo sinuoso e profondo, toccante e intenso come Recovery. Se anche non conoscessimo LP, rimarremmo in ogni caso colpiti dalle sfumature di un pezzo che risplende nell’oscurità, così come certi fiori luccicano nel fango.

Heart To Mouth raccoglie brani in cui dal cuore si arriva alla bocca, dal sentimento alle parole, dalla quiete alla tempesta, con un’attitudine schiettamente rock, un felice cortocircuito di melodie e di ritmi accompagnati da un canto che tende la malinconia verso un punto di non ritorno (Dreamcatcher) o la frenesia verso timbri rocciosi e parecchio riconoscibili (When I Move Over You). Che infatti rimanga sugli sfumati (One Night In The Sun) o che acceleri sui ritmi (Girls Go Wild), LP è essenzialmente una voce, che risuona di traccia in traccia, che si muove ineluttabile (The Power) e ruggente (Special, una chiusa di partita parecchio rock'n'roll), concedendosi anche un pugno di gemme dichiaratamente pop (Shaken) e retroattive (House On Fire). Non c’è un solo genere per queste continue e riuscite divagazioni fra folk del nuovo Millennio (Hey Nice To Kow Ya) e pulsazioni corali (Die For Your Love) e solitarie (Dreamer), dove, più che struggersi, si affrontano con energia amore, sogno, abbandono.

Heart To Mouth, nelle sue componenti, aggiunge alle hit del passato una terza dimensione, dove fragilità e forza convivono, si raccontano, e si aprono a un nuovo viaggio che si preannuncia una volta ancora, memorabile, col cuore e con le parole.

LYRICS:
My room is dark, the blinds are shut tight
And everything is still too much outside
It may be over, but not tonight
I may be older but I still cry

I can't stop sleeping in your clothes
You can't stop calling on the phone

Can't you see, I'm in recovery
Just let it be, I'm in recovery 

Holding on I know I'm almost there
So don't reach out and tell me that you care

I'm finally sober, I see the light
The worst is over, nobody died
I'm still tryin' to let you go
Oh baby please leave me alone

Can't you see, I'm in recovery
Just let it be, I'm in recovery 

I know you wanna say you're sorry
but I don't wanna hear that story 
And I don't wanna be a fool anymore
Can't you see, I'm in recovery

I always thought you'd be the one
Who always needed me, my home
You'd be my home
Suddenly your memory
And time is like an enemy
So cold 

Can't you see, I'm in recovery
I know you wanna say you're sorry
but I already heard that story
And I don't wanna be a fool anymore

Can't you see, I'm in recovery

Chewin' on a piece of grass, walkin' down the road
Tell me, how long you gonna stay here, Joe?
Some people say this town don't look good in snow
You don't care, I know

Ventura Highway in the sunshine
Where the days are longer
The nights are stronger than moonshine
You're gonna go, I know

'Cause the free wind is blowin' through your hair
And the days surround your daylight there
Seasons crying no despair
Alligator lizards in the air, in the air

Wishin' on a falling star, waitin' for the early train
Sorry boy, but I've been hit by a purple rain
Aw, c'mon Joe, you can always change your name
Thanks a lot son, just the same

Ventura Highway in the sunshine
Where the days are longer
The nights are stronger than moonshine
You're gonna go, I know

'Cause the free wind is blowin' through your hair
And the days surround your daylight there
Seasons crying no despair
Alligator lizards in the air, in the air

America is an American rock band formed in England in 1970 by Dewey Bunnell, Dan Peek, and Gerry Beckley. The trio met as sons of US Air Force personnel stationed in London, where they began performing live.

Achieving significant popularity in the 1970s, the trio was famous for their close vocal harmonies and light acoustic folk rock sound. The band released a string of hit albums and singles, many of which found airplay on pop/soft rock stations.

The band came together shortly after the members' graduation from high school, and a record deal with Warner Bros. Records followed. Their debut 1971 album, America, included the transatlantic hits ""A Horse with No Name"" and ""I Need You""; Homecoming (1972) included the single ""Ventura Highway""; and Hat Trick (1973), a modest success on the charts which fared poorly in sales, included one minor hit song ""Muskrat Love"". 1974's Holiday featured the hits ""Tin Man"" and ""Lonely People""; and 1975's Hearts generated the number one single ""Sister Golden Hair"" alongside ""Daisy Jane."" History: America's Greatest Hits, a compilation of hit singles, was released the same year and was certified multi-platinum in the United States and Australia. Peek left the group in 1977, and their commercial fortunes declined, despite a brief return to the top in 1982 with the single ""You Can Do Magic"".

The group continues to record material and tour with regularity. Their 2007 album Here & Now was a collaboration with a new generation of musicians who credited the band as an influence. America won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist and were nominated for Best Pop Vocal Group at the 15th Annual Grammy Awards in 1973.

And ride that highway in the sky

Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
You never know until you try

Well, I'm on my way
Yes, I'm back to stay
Well, I'm on my way back home

Never take you down or never give you up

Lyrics:
I wasn't starting yet, I didn't even think you were listening
I wasn't ready at all to say anything about anything interesting
It's a thing you have, you just don't know that you do it
You wait around in a conversation while I get in and start stumbling through it

I was so distracted then
I didn't have it straight in my head
I didn't have my face on yet
Or the role or the feel of where I was going with it all
I was suffering more than I let on
The tropic morning news was on
There's nothing stopping me now
From saying all the painful parts out loud

Got to my feet feeling that I'd let you down
Wanted to say it slow and perfect but it all somehow got switched around
Something went off on its own, my dumb automatic chit chat
It's not what I meant to say at all, there's no way you can attach me to that

Got up to seize the day 
With my head in my hands feeling strange
When all my thinking got mangled
And I caught myself talking myself off the ceiling
I was suffering more than I let on
The tropic morning news was on
There's nothing stopping me now
From saying all the painful parts out loud

Oh, where are all the moments we'd have?
Oh, where's the brain we shared?
Something somehow has you rapidly improving
Oh, what happened to the wavelength we were on?
Oh, where's the gravity gone?
Something somehow has you rapidly improving

You found the ache in my argument
You couldn't wait to get out of it
You found the slush in my sentiment
You made it sound so intelligent

You can stop and start an athlete's heart
How do I feel about it?
I would love to have nothing to do with it
I would like to move on and be through with it

I'll be over here lying near the ocean making ocean sounds
Let me know if you can come over and work the controls for a while

I was so distracted then
I didn't have it straight in my head
I didn't have my face on yet
Or the role or the feel of where I was going with it all
I was suffering more than I let on
The tropic morning news was on
There's nothing stopping me now
From saying all the painful parts out loud

Oh, where are all the moments we'd have?
Oh, where's the brain we shared?
Something somehow has you rapidly improving
Oh, what happened to the wavelength we were on?
Oh, where's the gravity gone?

Lyrics:
Memorize the bathwater, memorize the air
There'll come a time I'll wanna know I was here
Names on the doorframes, inches and ages
Handprints in concrete, at the softest stages

I don't know why I don't try harder
I feel like throwing towels into water

Get it down to nothing, everything that matters
Fever flashes, eyelashes and traffic patterns
Humidity, history, chemistry and panic
Swimsuits in windows of electric minivans

I don't know why I don't try harder
I've been going down some some strange water

Move forward now. There's nothing to do
Can't turn around, I can't follow you
Your coat's in my car I guess you forgot
It's crazy the things we let go of

It finally hits me, a mile's drive
The sky is leaking, my windshield's crying
I'm feeling sacred, my soul is stripped
Radio's painful, the words are clipped

The grief it gets me, the weird goodbyes
My car is creeping, I think it's dying
I'm pulling over, until it heals
I'm on a shoulder, of lemon fields

What was I even leaving for
I keep going back and forth
I think now I'm about to see
Didn't know how sad it'd be

Memorize the bathwater, memorize the air
There'll come a time I'll wanna know I was here
Names on the doorframes, inches and ages
Handprints in concrete, at the softest stages

I don't know why I don't try harder
I feel like throwing towels into water

Move forward now. There's nothing to do
Can't turn around, and I can't follow you
Your coat's in my car I guess you forgot
It's crazy the things we let go of

It finally hits me, a mile's drive
The sky is leaking, my windshield's crying
I'm feeling sacred, my soul is stripped
Radio's painful, the words are clipped

The grief it gets me, the weird goodbyes
My car is creeping, I think it's dying
I'm pulling over, until it heals
I'm on a shoulder, of lemon fields

The grief it gets me, the weird goodbyes
My car is creeping, I think it's dying
I'm pulling over, until it heals
I'm on a shoulder, of lemon fields

An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time.
Unsuspecting victims no warnings, no signs.
Judgment day the second coming arrives.
Before you see the light you must die.

Forgotten children, conform a new faith,
Avidity and lust controlled by hate.
the never ending search for your shattered sanity,
Souls of damnation in their own reality.

Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust.
Confrontations.
Impulsive habitat.

Bastard sons beget your cunting daughters,
Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers.
Engreat souls condemned for [all] eternity,
Sustained by immoral observance a domineering deity.

Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust.
Confrontations.
Impulsive sabbath.

On and on, south of heaven 

The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul.
A force that has lived all eternity.
A never ending search for a truth never told.
The loss of all hope and your dignity.

Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust.
Confrontations.
Impulsive habitat.

On and on, south of heaven",False,False,68115516.0,thrash metal

This is McDonnell's first stint directing a music video. He directed the 2013 horror film Hatchet III, and his rich resume as a motion picture cameraman includes Avengers: Age Of Ultron, Ant-Man and The Interview. For SLAYER's ""Repentless,"" he and the video's producer Felissa Rose pulled together a gang of actors and crew who have been part of some of the most iconic horror films ever made: Derek Mears (Predators, Friday The 13th, Tyler Mane (Halloween), Jason Trost (Hatchet III), Danny Trejo (Machete, From Dusk Till Dawn), Tony Moran (Halloween's Michael Myers, American Poltergeist), Sean Whalen (Men In Black, Halloween II), and Vernon Wells (Mad Max 2, Commando, Weird Science) all are featured inmates in the video. And if that wasn't enough, McDonnell and Rose brought in stunt coordinator Nils Allen Stewart who is known for his work on films like Planet Of The Apes, Anger Management and Daredevil.

About #Kx5:
Kx5 is a collaboration over a decade and a half in the making. deadmau5 and Kaskade effectively changed the electronic music landscape when they paired together for 2008’s slow-burning “I Remember” and the influence of their follow up “Move For Me” cemented their influence as the standard. Both tracks peaked at No. 1 within a week of one another on Billboard’s Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart. The GRAMMY-nominated artists’ paths crossed again on 2016’s ominous “Beneath with Me” featuring Skylar Grey.  More recently, in July 2021, Kaskade made history as the first public concert performed at Los Angeles’ SoFi Stadium. The sold-out show featured a surprise set by deadmau5 and had the two artists reuniting again for a set to close the show. As Kx5, deadmau5 and Kaskade are primed to write their own history.  Now the pair officially join forces to form  a unique collaborative union.

I'm not alone 'cause the TV's on yeah
I'm not crazy 'cause I take the right pills, every day
And rest, clean your conscience
Clear your thoughts with Speyside
With your grain
Clean your conscience
Clear your thoughts with Speyside

Our hearts littering the topsoil
Tune in
And we can get the last call

I bled the greed from my arm
Won't they give it a rest now?
Now?

Lyrics:
Gentlemen place your debts
Payment in full
By future you
I think we can all agree
The ending is off to a great start

The present is soon replaced
In small increments
Attention fades
One or another way,
The house collects its mark

How do we keep making all the same mistakes?
We’d rather have the misery than growing pains.

I chose a mystery
Went there alone, intentionally
Had to forgive myself
Grieving imaginary loss

You’ll pay with the life not lived
Pay with each thought
Of what could have been
(But) nothing adds to the cost
Like missing the ride you’re on

How do we keep making all the same mistakes?
We’d rather have the misery than growing pains.

Gentlemen place your debts
I’d wish you good luck
But luck isn’t it
The driver and passenger
Don’t go the same place

LETRA / LYRICS

Tiene un cañón de alegría disparando en los ojos
Y todo aquel que la mira se llena de amor
Es el ángel de la guarda para los demonios
Le juro que no le exagero, todo es corazón

Tiene la vida más vida si la tienes cerca
Es el paraguas, no te baila el agua sin más
Tiene la risa que alivia todos los problemas
Es esa palabra que escucha cada suspirar

Es una vela encendida porque si hay un día en la oscuridad
Vierte un ratito en la herida, por eso es mi amiga para bien y mal

Qué bonito es saber qué siempre estás ahí
Quiero que sepas que voy a cuidar de ti
Qué bonito es querer y poder confiar
Afortunado yo por tener tu amistad

Es la orillita del agua vencida que rompe
Cuando se pone valiente no sabe frenar
No tiene miedo a la gente, lucha en el desorden
Que la justicia gana ya por la libertad

Es una vela encendida porque si hay un día en la oscuridad
Vierte un ratito en la herida, por eso es mi amiga para bien y mal

Qué bonito es saber qué siempre estás ahí
Quiero que sepas que voy a cuidar de ti
Qué bonito es querer y poder confiar
Afortunado yo por tener tu amistad

Ella no supo qué hacer cuando la derrotaron
Ella aprendió de las lágrimas, harta de llorar
Por ello tiene ese brillo y el grito de un faro
Es el paso pal caminito perdido encontrar

Qué bonito es saber qué siempre estás ahí
Quiero que sepas que voy a cuidar de ti
Qué bonito es querer y poder confiar
Afortunado yo por tener tu amistad

Qué bonito es saber qué siempre estás ahí
Quiero que sepas que voy a cuidar de ti
Qué bonito es querer y poder confiar
Afortunado yo por tener tu amistad

Qué bonito es saber qué siempre estás ahí
Quiero que sepas que voy a cuidar de ti
Qué bonito es querer y poder confiar
Afortunado yo por tener tu amistad

LETRA / LYRICS

Antes de que me quede sin corazón
Voy a decirte todo lo que me pasa
Te quiero a cada instante, lo sabe Dios
Aunque quererte tanto también me mata

Es el viento en tu pelo, tu libertad
La que me muerde
Es el deseo constante de amarte más

¿Qué quieres que le haga?
Si cuando me clavas la mirada
Se vuelve loco mi pensamiento
Nunca lo digo pero lo siento

En cada momentito
Que tú me tienes y estás conmigo
Lluvia de estrellas que se disparan
Dilo bajito que me hace falta
Dilo bajito, que me hace falta

Me pierde tu manera de sonreír
En tu sonrisa cabe la luz del mundo
Niña traviesa, quisiera repetir
Los besos que nos faltan
Uno por uno
Y es esta duda negra del corazón
Que a veces tengo
Si tu la coloreas será mejor

¿Qué quieres que le haga?
Si cuando me clavas la mirada
Se vuelve loco mi pensamiento
Nunca lo digo pero lo siento

En cada momentito
Que tú me tienes y estás conmigo
Lluvia de estrellas que se disparan
Dilo bajito que me hace falta

Cierra la puerta y abre tu corazón
Que te lo cuento, uh

¿Qué quieres que le haga?
Si cuando me clavas la mirada
Se vuelve loco mi pensamiento
Nunca lo digo pero lo siento

En cada momentito
Que tú me tienes y estás conmigo
Lluvia de estrellas que se disparan
Dilo bajito que me hace falta
Es buscarte sin saber
Y sentir escalofríos
En el alma y en la piel
Si te dijera lo que no se ve
Es quererte sin tener
Es decirte buenos días
Con el beso que inventé
Cuando te pienso sonrío después

LETRA / LYRICS

Ahora es el momento  
y no mañana 
que empiece de nuevo  
la función 
ahora que ya no pierdo  
la calma 
ante tanto tonto de ocasión 

 
Ahora toma paz  
y después gloria 
ahora que sanó 
la cicatriz 
escribamos juntos  
otra historia 
donde no tengamos que fingir 

 
Ahora que encontré  
en el paso firme 
el camino de mi libertad 
mira a las estrellas lo que dicen  
cuanto más oscuro brillas mucho mas 

 
Mira  
hay que vivir el momento 
mira  
hay que vivir el momento  
esta noche bailarán  
las agujas del reloj 
ahora solo quiero, ahora solo quiero 

 
Mira 
hay que vivir el momento  
mira 
hay que vivir el momento  
siento como un huracán  
dentro de mi corazón 

 
Ahora solo quiero  
ahora solo quiero  
solo quiero respirar 

 
A mi enseñó la vida a golpes 
en la calle supe la verdad 
así que no vengas con lecciones 
y aplícate el cuento  
antes de hablar 

 
Ahora no confisques mis ideas
no quieras llevarme a tu redil 
moriré con estas botas puestas 
y si pierdo que sea por mi 

 
Ahora que las redes nos atrapan 
y se subestima la verdad 
ahora que nos cubren las espaldas  
los mismos que nos condenan sin piedad 

 
Mira  
hay que vivir el momento 
mira  
hay que vivir el momento  
esta noche bailarán  
las agujas del reloj 
ahora solo quiero, ahora solo quiero 

 
Mira  
hay que vivir el momento  
mira, hay que vivir el momento  
siento como un huracán  
dentro de mi corazón 

 
Ahora solo quiero  
ahora solo quiero  
es la hora de cambiar 

 
Cada vez está más complicado  
encontrar a alguien de verdad 
de los que se quedan a tu lado 
cuando el brillo deja de brillar 

 
Ahora que me aburro de mi sombra 
ahora que sabemos lo peor 
ahora es el momento de intentarlo  
y encontrar por fin la solución 

 
La solución  
es mi canción  
sube el telón

LETRA / LYRICS

Eres
como la llama, 
como la nieve 
como el milagro que se aparece
la peligrosa razón que encuentro
para curar lo que siento

Eres
a veces frágil, a veces fuerte
me das la vida me das la muerte
vamos corriendo detrás del viento
sorteando los contratiempos

Que tú eres tantas cosas
que es imposible saber quién eres 
por eso a más enredo
tu telaraña se hace más fuerte

Que somos blanco y negro
Y si nos mezclamos 
llueven colores
sembramos sobre el barro
y de los ojillos nos salen flores

Que no se ven 
hay cositas que nunca se ven
como explico lo que yo no sé
que no puedo aunque quiera dejarlo

Eres
como la llama, como la nieve 
como el milagro que se aparece
la peligrosa razón que encuentro
para curar lo que siento

Eres
a veces frágil, a veces fuerte
me das la vida me das la muerte
vamos corriendo detrás del viento
sorteando los contratiempos

Que yo no quiero trampas
pero si vienen de ti me dejo
qué importa que yo pierda
yo gano siempre cuando te tengo

Que yo lo quiero todo 
pero ese todo te nombra a ti
si tengo algo verdadero,
entre tanto lo primero 
tú eres…

Eres
como la llama, como la nieve 
como el milagro que se aparece
la peligrosa razón que encuentro
para curar lo que siento

Eres
A veces frágil, a veces fuerte 
me das la vida me das la muerte
vamos corriendo detrás del viento
sorteando los contratiempos

Y ahora solo quiero cantar 
para ti, para ti, para mi…

Si me llevas la contraria
más quiero de ti…

Eres
como la llama, como la nieve 
como el milagro que se aparece
la peligrosa razón que encuentro
para curar lo que siento

Eres
A veces frágil, a veces fuerte 
me das la vida me das la muerte
vamos corriendo detrás del viento
sorteando los contratiempos

Para ti, para ti, para mi…

Si tengo algo verdadero esa eres tú…

Para ti, para ti, para mi…

LETRA / LYRICS

Fue porque no ardes que no te veo 
fue montar el drama al tinte del pelo 
fue que no me sale y tú no te atreves 
fue el final de mierda de aquella serie 

 
Fue la gata cómplice en el tejado 
fue yo no te araño si me haces caso 
fue la risa plena de aquella foto 
fue que al repetirla ya éramos otros 


Y fue lo que te debo lo que me debes 
fue el combate nulo en cuatro paredes 


Fue sentirme solo estando contigo 
fueron los disparos sin un motivo 
fue la herida abierta sin un consuelo 
fue ya no me mates con un te quiero 

 
Fue ya no te importo lo suficiente 
fue me estoy muriendo a mi quien me entiende  
fue el silencio a gritos del dormitorio 
fue la vida idílica de los otros 


Fue el número puesto en aquel bolsillo 
fue el principio el juego de aquellos niños 
fue la risa tonta de los amantes 
ojalá pudiera ser como antes 

 
Fue que en la terraza tomando el sol 
se cubrió de hielo mi corazón 
fue que mi guitarra también sabia  
que si te nombraba  
a mí me dolía 


Y fue creer que el tiempo lo arreglaría 
y fue porque ante todo yo te quería 

 
Fue sentirme solo estando contigo 
fueron los disparos sin un motivo 
fue la herida abierta sin un consuelo 
fue ya no me mates con un te quiero 

 
Fue ya no te importo lo suficiente 
fue me estoy muriendo a mi quién me entiende  
fue el silencio a gritos del dormitorio 
fue la vida idílica de los otros  

 
Fue la firma el beso sin un contrato 
fueron las mentiras en los zapatos 
fue que el oleaje que en su deriva 
por más que no quiera rompe en la orilla  

 
Y fue que no podía y quería hacerlo 
y fue que tu sentías que estaba muerto 
y fue que si soñando abría las alas  
era porque en el sueño tú siempre estabas  

 
Fue la botella abierta cerrando heridas  
fue beber de tus labios la vida misma  
fue los dos en el coche sin un destino 
tratando de encontrarnos por el camino  

 
Fue sentirme solo estando contigo 
fueron los disparos sin un motivo 
fue la herida abierta sin un consuelo 
fue ya no me mates con un te quiero 


Fue ya no te importo lo suficiente 
fue me estoy muriendo a mi quién me entiende  
fue el silencio a gritos del dormitorio 
fue la vida idílica de los otros

LETRA / LYRICS

Ya no llevaremos la venda
Buscaremos respuestas
Moriremos de amor.
Ya no, por más que quiera verte
Ya no puedo tenerte
Ya todo terminó.
Ya todo rompe en mí, se va y me mata.
¿Qué quieres?

Ya no tengo fuerzas para resistir
Ya no tengo palabras para rebatir
Ya no, te alejas y me dueles.
Ya no habrá canción ni bailes de pasión
Los ojos que ahora miras, no los veo yo.
Ya no seremos para siempre.

Los dos, cada uno por su cuenta
Cada cual su pelea
Un te quiero sin voz.
Dolor, si no estuve contigo
Si no supe decirlo
No me guardes rencor.
Si todo intento ya es un disparate
¿Qué quieres?

Ya no tengo fuerzas para resistir
Ya no tengo palabras para rebatir
Ya no, te alejas y me dueles.
Ya no habrá canción ni bailes de pasión
Los ojos que ahora miras, no los veo yo.
Ya no, seremos para siempre.

Acuérdate cuando dijimos:
Mira, yo no voy a hacerlo.
Sobre la mesa, el mar, los besos
Y esta lucha de poder.
Si quieres yo me presto a ser el pistolero
Que mate los reproches, también el veneno.
Ya no, tu descaro en la cama
Con el pasillo en llamas
Derramando la vida
Borrachos de risa y deseo.
Ya no, cubrirás mis espaldas
En tus nervios, mi calma.
Besaré tus heridas
Cuando estés dolida del mundo.

Ya no, ya no, ya no.
No me mires que sabes que puedo caer.
Ya no habrá canción ni bailes de pasión
Los ojos que ahora miras, no los veo yo.
Ya no, seremos para siempre.

LETRA / LYRICS

Empezaron los problemas
Se engancho a la pena
Se aferro a la soledad
Ya no mira las estrellas
Mira sus ojeras
Cansada de pelear.

Olvidándose de todo
Busca algún modo
De encontrar su libertad
El cerrojo que le aprieta
Le pone cadenas
Y nunca descansa en paz
Y tu dignidad
Se a quedado esperando a que vuelvas...

Que nadie calle tu verdad
Que nadie te ahogue el corazón
Que nadie te haga mas llorar
Hundiéndote en silencio
Que nadie te obligue a morir
Cortando tu alas al volar
Que vuelvan tus ganas de vivir.

En el túnel del espanto
Todo se hace largo
Cuando se iluminara
Amarrado a su destino
Va sin ser testigo
De tu lento caminar.

Tienen hambre sus latidos
Pero son sumisos
Y suenan a su compás
La alegría traicionera
Le cierra la puerta
O se sienta en su sofá
Y tu dignidad
Se a quedado esperando a que vuelva.

Que nadie calle tu verdad
Que nadie te ahogue el corazón
Que nadie te haga mas llorar
Hundiéndote en silencio
Que nadie te obligue a morir
Cortando tu alas al volar
Que vuelvan tus ganas de vivir.

Que nadie calle tu verdad
Que nadie te ahogue el corazón
Que nadie te haga mas llorar
Hundiéndote en silencio
Que nadie te obligue a morir
Cortando tu alas al volar
Que vuelvan tus ganas de vivir...

LETRA / LYRICS

Escúchame, si estás ahí, quiero que sepas
Que esta canción nace de ti por ser la dueña
La dueña de mi inspiración
La que despierta en mi la voz
Dando sentido a todo lo que no lo tiene
Me paro en este renglón para decirte que te quiero

Escúchame, si estás ahí, quiero que sepas
Que sigo aqui sintiéndote con este miedo
Por que no aguantes
Y el corazón se te distraiga por momentos
Y te olvides de mi
Que envidiosa la distancia
También quiso formar parte de lo nuestro

Y ahora que mi canción te toca
Que tiembla de emoción
Que sus palabras juegan como locas a extrañarte
Y ahora, si ves como te lloran
Acuerdate de mi, necesito tanto verte

Escúchame, si estas ahi, quiero que sepas
Que no te olvido
Que no hay distancia que nos detengan
Que a veces caigo en el recuerdo
De tus manos con mis manos
Y me hacen sonreir
Asi me siento feliz dentro de esta tristeza

Y ahora que mi canción te toca
Que tiembla de emoción
Que sus palabras juegan como locas a extrañarte
Y ahora, si ves como te lloran
Acuérdate de mi, necesito tanto verte

No te preocupes mi vida
Camina tranquila
Lo sé no hace falta que digas
Si lo sé, si lo sé lo sé

Y ahora si ves como te lloran
Acuérdate de mi, necesito tanto verte

Lyrics:
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do nowhere to go-o-oh
I wanna be sedated

Just get me to the airport, put me on a plane
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go insane
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
Oh no-o-o-o-o

Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do nowhere to go-o-oh
I wanna be sedated

Just put me in a wheelchair, get me on a plane
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go insane
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
Oh no-o-o-o-o

Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do nowhere to go-o-oh
I wanna be sedated

Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go loco
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes
Oh no-o-o-o-o

Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do nowhere to go-o-oh
I wanna be sedated

Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go loco
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes
Oh no-o-o-o-o

Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated
Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated
Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated
Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated

Lyrics:
Under the arc of a weather stain boards
Ancient goblins and warlords
Come out of the ground, not making a sound
The smell of death is all around
And the night when the cold wind blows
No one cares, nobody knows

I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again

Follow Victor to the sacred place
This ain't a dream, I can't escape
Molars and fangs, the clicking of bones
Spirits moaning among the tombstones
And the night, when the moon is bright
Someone cries, something ain't right

I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again

The moon is full, the air is still
All of a sudden I feel a chill
Victor is grinning, flesh rotting away
Skeletons dance, I curse this day
And the night when the wolves cry out
Listen close and you can hear me shout

I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again

Oh no, oh no
I don't want to live my life not again, oh no, oh oh
I don't want to live my life not again, oh no no no
I don't want to live my life not again, oh oh

The album was released on March 12, 2021 by Nuclear Blast. It received average reviews upon release. It was Rob Zombie's first album to reach No. 1 at the Billboard's Top Album Sales Chart in the US in the first week of its release.

In 2018, Rob Zombie stated in an interview with ""Whiplash"", the KLOS radio show hosted by Full Metal Jackie, that the music on his upcoming album will be ""much more complicated structurally"". According to Rob, his goal on his next album has once again been to explore new territory without deviating too much from his tried-and-tested formula.

The original plan was to release the album in 2019. During an interview at January 2019, John 5 described the album at a Talk Toomey podcast as ""hooky and musical, and badass. The best Zombie record to date—better than White Zombie anything…He went nuts on this one. I'm telling you, it's the best Zombie record you guys will hear. And we're going to have a big tour. We're going to do videos, and you know, I've been in the band with the guy forever and I just love him"". Later in the same year with an interview with Revolver, John 5 said of the new music as ""Heavy, very heavy. It's just a heavy Zombie record with great hooks. It's very, very musical, and a hard-hitting Zombie record. I think people are really gonna dig it. I'm a Zombie fan, and if I heard it, I'd be like, 'Oh my God, this is brutal.' I'm really excited about it!"".

Lyrics

How does it feel to treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me and told me who you are
I thought I was mistaken, I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel
Tell me now, how do I feel
Those who came before me lived through their vocations
From the past until completion, they'll turn away no more
And still I find it so hard to say what I need to say
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me just how I should feel today
I see a ship in the harbor
I can and shall obey
But if it wasn't for your misfortune, I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken, and I thought I heard you speak
Tell me, how do I feel
Tell me now, how should I feel
Now I stand here waiting
I thought I told you to leave me when I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel, when your heart grows cold, grows cold, cold

Lyrics

What does this ship bring to me
Far across the restless sea
Waiting for the sirens' call
I've never seen it here before
There she plies a lonely trade
Cutting through the breaking waves
Drifting slowly from her course
She is lost forever more
We all want some kind of love
But sometimes it's not enough
To the wall and through the door
With a stranger on the shore
I won't desert you
I don't know what to say
I really hurt you
I nearly gave it all away
I've got it all wrong
Cause you were not the wrong one
And I don't know where to turn when you're gone
When you're gone
Gotta catch the midnight train
First to Paris then to Spain
Travel with a document
All across the continent
City life is flying by
The wheels are turning all the while
Get on board we can't be late
Our destination cannot wait
All the stars and all the worlds
Filling up this universe
Could never be as close as us
Will never shine as bright on us
I won't desert you
I don't know what to say
I really hurt you
I nearly gave it all away
I've got it all wrong
Cause you were not the wrong one
And I don't know where to turn when you're gone
When you're gone
I won't desert you
I don't know what to say
I really hurt you
I nearly gave it all away
I've got it all wrong
Cause you were not the wrong one
And I don't know where to turn when you're gone
How many times must I lose my way, hey
How many words do I have to say, hey
What can I do just to make you see
That you're so good for a man like
A man like me
