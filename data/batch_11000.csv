Directed By Jonas Odell

So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot then we can die

I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, don't you know?
You say, you don't know
I say, take me out!
I say, you don't show
Don't move, time is slow
I say, take me out!

Well I say, you don't know?
You say, you don't go
I say, take me out!

If I move, this could die
Eyes move, this can die
I want you to take me out

I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, don't you know?
You say, you don't know
I say, take me out!

If I wane, this could die
I wait, this could die
I want you to take me out
If I move, this could die
Eyes move, this can die
Come on, take me out

I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here with you",True,True,649504490.0,indie rock

Gonna make somebody love me
I'm gonna make somebody love me

I know that it's you

LYRICS

Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go 
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

I used to know
That I used to know

Somebody...

LYRICS

Pick apart
The pieces of your heart
And let me peer inside
Let me in
Where only your thoughts have been
Let me occupy your mind
As you do mine

You have lost
Too much love
To fear, doubt and distrust
(It's not enough)
You just threw away the key
To your heart
You don't get burned
('Cause nothing gets through)
It makes it easier
(Easier on you)
But that much more difficult for me
To make you see...

Love ain't fair
So there you are
My love

Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense
But I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this

Love ain't safe
You won't get hurt if you stay chaste
So you can wait
But I don't wanna waste my love",True,True,31881306.0,art pop

LYRICS

So this is the end of the story
Everything we had, everything we did
Is buried in dust
And this dust is all that's left of us

But only a few ever worried
Though the signs were clear, they had no idea
You just get used to living in fear
Or give up
When you can't even picture your future

We walk the plank with our eyes wide open...

Some people offered up answers
We made out like we heard, but they were only words
They didn't add up
To a change in the way we were living

And the saddest thing-
Is all of it could have been avoided
But it was like to stop consuming is to stop being human
And why would I make a change if you won't
We're all in the same boat, staying afloat
For the moment

And we walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we..
Walk the plank with our eyes wide open

With our eyes wide open we...
Walk the plank, we walk the plank

And that was the end of the story",True,True,45532240.0,alternative rock

LYRICS

You're a fraud and you know it
But it's too good to throw it all away
Anyone would do the same
You've got 'em going
And you're careful not to show it
Sometimes you even fool yourself a bit
It's like magic
But it's always been a smoke and mirrors game
Anyone would do the same

So now that you've arrived well you wonder
What is it that you've done to make the grade
And should you do the same?
(Is that too easy?)
Are you only trying to please them
Will they see then-
You're desperate to deliver
Anything that could give you
A sense of reassurance
When you look in the mirror

Such highs and lows
You put on quite a show
All these highs and lows
And you're never really sure
What you do it for
Well do you even want to know?
You put on quite a show

Mother
Are you watching?

You're a fraud and you know it
And every night and day you take the stage
And it always entertains
You're giving pleasure
And that's admirable you tell yourself
And so you'd gladly sell yourself
To others
Mother
Are you watching?

Such highs and lows
You put on quite a show
All these highs and lows
And you're never really sure

LYRICS

When the Cotillion arrived
We threw out the television
Model D 575
Has custom flute presets
And Harmony-Plus in addition

Now for an arm and a leg
We get three half-dozen beats to choose from
So now we can pretend
That there's an orchestra in the loungeroom

I put the Genie Bass on
So my left hand can play the choir
With 16ft Diapason
And Lowrey's patented Orchestral Symphonizer

Banjo's great on repeat
The kids want to play but they'll have to be patient
The wife can't help tapping her feet
It's a genuine home entertainment revelation

State of the art
(Hold the phone, it's so)
State of the art
[Listen to the difference!]
(Oh my god, it's so)
State of the art
[By use of a computer]
State of the art

Now we don't want to go out
When we could spend the night at home with the Cotillion
Invite the neighbours around
Start the bossanova beat and limbo from the living to the kitchen

Enjoy the state of the art
The Magic Swing Piano really is astounding
Now we can't tell them apart
But these amazing simulations end up sounding even better than the real thing

State of the art
(Hold the phone, it's so)
[Computer controlled tone colour]
State of the art
[The marriage of music to computers is quite natural]
(Oh my god, it's so)
State of the art

LYRICS

Seventeen seconds and I'm over it
Ready for the disconnect
Putting on a brave face
Trying not to listen
to the voices in the back of my head

(But it's alright now)
It's a distant memory baby
(It's alright now)
You know you should just let it go

But some feelings have a habit of persisting
even though you wouldn't let it show

Wearing me out
(All this)
Hanging around
(It just starts)
Getting me down
('till I'm just)
Looking for an easy way out

Braindead from boredom
I'm led to distraction
Scratching the surface of life
Nothing really happens
But it's easy to keep busy
When you tell yourself you're traveling right

(But it's alright now)
Was it really worth it baby?
(It's alright now)
Was it just a waste of time?

Keep on second-guessing
Use my memory like a weapon
On everything I try",True,True,15253974.0,alternative rock

Benim bir sırrım var, açıklanmayacak kadar sır
Bundan çıkar hır. Haplamalar vuku bulur, dert kahır
Sırdan geçen dilim olsa, hal eder diken
Bilmez bilen bağdar olur benden iken

Ya söylersen kim anlar?
Söylemezsen bağlar, gamlardan ağlar
Bu yıpranışla dağılır bütün
Doymaz Sago yakar tütün
İçindeyim bu oyunun büsbütün
Hayatıma musallat oldu şöhret ün
Karıştı yarınım bitti dün, tedirgin bugün
Topla çıkar, nedir sonuç?

Her kıyasla dilime değer
Bıçağa ait keskin uç, kimdir suçlu, kimde suç?
Öylesine ki, bir iki biber yakmadan, bırakmaz rahat
Yarası ağır, dilimin bulamıyorum kapatacak bant
Üzerime gelin bakın, dinamit bağlı gövdeme
Yaklaşanı uçururum, uçurtma misali pimden iplerle
Fesatlar, kapıma vardılar, ellerinde güllerle
İşlerine gelmediğimde, saldırdılar aynı güllerin dikenleriyle
Vurdular siyah güllelerle

Giy, ateşten gömlekleri, bir bir yansın üzerin ve dahi
Kır, topraktan çömlekleri zaten tedirgin halim (ve dahi)
Bir, benimdir bendim ve bir kendim ortadayım
Bitmez derdim, bu hal beni yer, bitirir bildim (aha)
Giy, ateşten gömlekleri, bir bir yansın üzerin ve dahi
Kır, topraktan çömlekleri zaten tedirgin halim (ve dahi)
Bir, benimdir bendim ve bir kendim ortadayım
Bitmez derdim, bu hal beni yer, bitirir bildim (aa)

Aklıma gelen başıma geldi. başım yarıldı, aşım soğudu
Yine iştahsızlık evinde oyuncak etti açlığımı
Artık kartopu oynamak istemiyorum, ellerim dondu
Türlü saklambaç oyunlarından, gözlerim yoruldu
Ner'desiniz güven abideleri (he), cesaret haylazları?
Gösterin bana altmış ikiden, tavşan yapan hokkabazları
Belirleyin karşımda durabilecek, tüm küfürbazları
Demirden mızraplarla kırdım sazları
Deştim böğrümden kıyamadığım hazları, verin bana yazları
İlahi merhamet sarayı, ya Hannan
Sensin Rana, sensin Mana, sensin Rahman, sensin Canan
Ruhum işgalden kurtulmaz, vatan infilak eder alev ateş volkan, hislerim kırık var
Püskürüyor üzerime lav kıvılcım korlar
Elimdeki bi' avuç dolusu su ile, sönmez bu yangınlar
Ben bi' sırra sahibim, hayat uykusuna yatmış
Ben çok dosta sahiptim, güvensizlik içine batmış
Şahit olduğum birileri mutluluğu, parayla kapmış
Giy, ateşten gömlekleri, bir bir yansın üzerin ve dahi
Kır, topraktan çömlekleri zaten tedirgin halim (ve dahi)
Bir, benimdir bendim ve bir kendim ortadayım
Bitmez derdim, bu hal beni yer, bitirir bildim (aha)
Giy, ateşten gömlekleri, bir bir yansın üzerin ve dahi

Sagopa Kajmer - Galiba Sözleri:

Bu ikilemlerin arkasında çok şey var 
Hiç bir şey bir neden değilki, 
Ama hak ettiğimi düşündüğümde hiç de adil değilki 
Sen nesin ve kimsin ? Sal yaralı balıkları gitsin, misina artık çok gergin 

İster istemez her şeyim sende rehin 
Ne yanlış bir karar masası, sen ne kötü bir hakimsin 
Bu ne zor bi dosya, sen ne kolay bir kararsın 
Senden görünmüyor önüm, meğer ne kolaymış fikri ölüm. 

Hep anlatırdı sevdiklerim; ""böyleyken böyle olur"".Söz söylenir göz dolar, Haziranlar Şubat olur! 
İhtimallerimi düşünürüm ve ihmallerimi yoklarım, 
İçimden ayrılık şarkıları bestelerim ve söylerim. 

Ben deli dolu biriyim, ama şu an sadece doluyum, 
Kırılmış bir sağ kolum, 
Gönlü bir hayli kırık, yapayalnız, bomboş bir yolum (beenn) 
Beni arayan orda bulur, sözün bittiği yerde bekliyorum. 
Canım malum, yarım eksik, bu kadar mı kolay çeker insan sevdiğinin şakaklarına tetik 
Sanki sen bir avcı, bense infilak eden keklik 
Vakit durdu, bu acı beni boğdu, bittim şimdilik. 

Ama galiba, bütün bu olanlara dayanamam, ama hazırım 
Sen giderken adımlarını sayarım 
Heyhat ! Ne yazık seni yanlış tanıdım sanırım. 

Ama galiba, bütün bu olanlara dayanamam, ama hazırım 
Sen giderken adımlarını sayarım 
Heyhat ! Ne yazık seni yanlış tanıdım sanırım.

---366.GÜN---

1.RAP
Kurulu bir makinayım ,ya arıza yaparsam?
İstemediğim halde ya devrelerimi yakarsam ?
Dik durmam gerek,ya yere yıkılırsam?
Ya bir çuval inciri mahveden ben olursam?
Bir daha düşünecek olsam aynı yanlışı iki kere yapar mıydım?
sanmam.
Eyvahlar olsun bir daha kanmam.
Ne de zor oluyor aradıklarımı bulmam.
Sorduğum soruların yanıtını almam.
Cevap belliyse sorusunu sormam.
Dişlerim sivri ama korkma ısırmam.
Bana ''bit lan artık'' derler azalmam.
Sohbeti ne de düzetek,haz almam.
Çoğundan hoşlandığımı pek sanmam.
İstediğim anda istediğim yerde olsam.
Süperman gibi istediğim yere uçup konsam.

NAKARAT
İnkarı bırak kabullen,kabullenmekten başka çaren yok.
Ne de zor oluyor aradıklarını bulman.
Pek de zor oluyor aradıklarını bulman.

2.RAP
366.gün,yüzüm yine bana dönük.
Meskenim değişiyor maskenin ardı görüldüğü zaman kırılıyor kaburgan.
Panda gibi soyu tükeniyor güvenimin.
Ormandaki ağaç kadar yalnızlık yakından.
Hey, bana güneş olur musun istesem çevremi saran karanlık şu perdeden?
Ben göremesem de uzakları şimdiden,
bana her şey çok uzak be kendiliğinden beri kendimi bildiğimden.
Emin değilim bilmek istediğimden.
Defalarca yıpranırsın bildiğinden.
İnkar etme kabullen peşindesin bildiğinde bildiğine pişman olacağını bilmene rağmen neden?
Bir tek aklın kaldı onu da senden aşıramazlar.
Ara ve bul çok uzun saklanamazlar.
ne o?
olacakları biliyorken çok fazla şaşıramazlar.
Tazı durdu artık koşturamazlar.

NAKARAT
İnkarı bırak kabullen,kabullenmekten başka çaren yok.
Ne de zor oluyor aradıklarını bulman.
Pek de zor oluyor aradıklarını bulman.",True,True,38657916.0,rap

Şarkı Sözleri ;
PATRON
Karanlık sardı semtin sokaklarını 
Çatılar ve şehrin ışıklarını
Tuz basar ay bu gece benim yarama 
Bir saat bile kalamam
Bir daha seni aramam
Kalbim sanki bi plastik poşet uçuyor 
Şansım yok hep pusu hiç bir suçum yok 
kumpaslar var bu gece benim kafama 
Hiç saatleri sayamam
İtaaat edip yaşamam
Gece mavi şehir bej
Evde party elde tape
Her fedai hisseder
Mütevazi endişe
Engebeli en tepe
Çeker seni en dibe 
İsyanım çok evimde
Halil Sezai gibiyim
Kimi adi kimi fake
bir iki cahil bir iki keş
Hepsi badi hepsi bey
Hepsi artist hepsi fame
Cepte money ev depo
Bir zebani elde co 
İsyanım çok evimde
Halil Sezai gibiyim
Ben inanırım ama başka kimseye söylemem 
Var isyanım odalar dolusu başka istemem
Bir sabahın sonuyum bugün gündüzü bekleyen
Nefes kızıl ben silah
Gece mavi ben siyah 
NAKARAT
Neden eder insan isyan ?
Onca yalan ürettin
Tonla doğru gücendi 
Duyduklarım hezeyan
Borca sabır tükettim 
Dosta zaman tükendi
Günler mi yıllar mı beni sınayan 
Düşündükçe gücendim 
tükettikçe tükettin
Şimdi tükenmez de tükendi
Güvensizdin güvendim
Yok öyle yağma
SAGOPA KAJMER
Uzunca düşündüm yine de çıkamadım
düşüncelerimin ittiği çıkmaz sokaklardan
Kurtarın beni bir hadi el uzatın ordan
Yetişebilirim uzanan eline burdan
Uzunca söyledim kısaca anla
Anlatmak istediklerim var yüzüme bakarak dinle
Söylediklerini yazdım bir kenara daireler içinde
Anla ki gözlerim yağmura doydu doğacak güneşler peşinde
Sanki bebeği beşiğindeyken babası uçurum eşiğinde
Aynen öyle,  Kayboldum metropolde.
Bir anda savrulan arabamın izleri duruyor şarampolde
Boğuldu gözümün bebeği tuzlu gölde
Şimdilik iyiyim sonrası ne olur bugünüm yarınım bir yanım karambolde
Oynuyoruz aynı filmde
Kim kötü kim iyi rolde
Hayalet yönetmenle
içinde sen ve benle
Oyna hadi akıyor sahne
Zorunlu drama, trajikomik
Burada benim gibilerin işi ne?
Son verdim kalbimin gereksiz işine
Yaşarım hayatı gelişine
Aldırmam kaderin çekilişine
Neden mi ? bilirsin aldırmaz o benim iç çekişime
Kendimle çekişmelerime ve yumuyor gözünü
fikrimle zihnimin yakamı çekiştirmelerine
Bu gemimi batırır okyanus derinine
Uzunca düşündüm yine de çıkamadım
düşüncelerimin ittiği çıkmaz sokaklardan
Kurtarın beni bir hadi el uzatın ordan
Yetişebilirim uzanan eline burdan
Uzunca söyledim kısaca anla

Neden eder İnsan İsyan ?
Onca yalan ürettin
Tonla doğru gücendi 
Duyduklarım hezeyan
Borca sabır tükettim 
Dosta zaman tükendi
Günler mi yıllar mı beni sınayan 
Düşündükçe gücendim 
tükettikçe tükettin
Şimdi tükenmez de tükendi
Güvensizdin güvendim
Yok öyle yağma

Working primarily with bassist Fred Marshall and drummer Jerry Granelli, Guaraldi paired inspired interpretations of traditional holiday fare (“O Tannenbaum,” “Hark, the Herald Angels Sing,” and “What Child Is This”) with original compositions, including the instantly recognizable “Linus and Lucy” theme, “Skating,” and “Christmas Time Is Here.” The latter song, available as both an instrumental and vocal track, featured young choral singers from St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in San Rafael, CA.

 
More than five decades later, the Emmy® and Peabody®-winning animated classic has spawned more than two dozen subsequent PEANUTS specials. Guaraldi’s soundtrack, meanwhile, has since become one of the best-selling jazz albums in history, second only to Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue, and regularly ranks among America’s top-selling holiday albums every December.

LYRICS

Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza
Ya empezamos como es
Mi música no discrimina a nadie
Así que vamos a romper

Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo cómo los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
El mundo nos quiere, nos quiere, me quiere a mí

Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo cómo los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
Mi música los tiene fuerte bailando y se baila así

Estamos rompiendo la discoteca
La fiesta no para, apenas comienza
C'est comme ci, c'est comme ça
Ma chérie, la la la la la

Francia, Colombia, me gusta (freeze)
J Balvin, Willy William, te gusta (freeze)

Los DJs no mienten, les gusta mi gente
Y eso se fue mundial (freeze)
No le bajamos, más nunca paramos
Es otro palo y blam

¿Y dónde está mi gente?
Mais fais bouger la tête
¿Y dónde está mi gente?
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
¡Un, dos, tres, leggo! (ay, di que sí)

Esquina a esquina, de ahí nos vamos
El mundo es grande, pero lo tengo en mis manos
Estoy muy duro, sí, okay, ahí vamos
Y con el tiempo nos seguimos elevando (y yeah)

Que seguimos rompiendo aquí y yeah
Esta fiesta no tiene fin y yeah
Botellas para arriba, sí
Los tengo bailando, rompiendo y yo sigo aquí (y yeah)

Que seguimos rompiendo aquí y yeah
Esta fiesta no tiene fin y yeah
Botellas para arriba, sí
Los tengo bailando, rompiendo...

¿Y dónde está mi gente?
Mais fais bouger la tête
¿Y dónde está mi gente?
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
¡Un, dos, tres, leggo! (ay, di que sí)

Lyrics:

If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me

All the things
That we've been through
You should understand me
Like I understand you
Now girl I know the difference
Between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing
To break up our happy home
Don't get so excited
When I come home
A little late at night
'Cause we only act like children
When we argue fuss and fight

If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me

We've all got our
Own funny moods
I've got mine,
Woman you've got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we've been together
It should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together
Or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair
When you can't see eye to eye

If you don't know me by now
You will never
Never never know me",True,True,200929081.0,blue-eyed soul

DID YOU KNOW that the June Rebellion took place between June 5-6 in 1832? And to celebrate its anniversary, this week on Screen Bites it is going to be full of ''music of a people who will not be slaves again!''

Les Misérables (2012) SYNOPSIS: After 19 years as a prisoner, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is freed by Javert (Russell Crowe), the officer in charge of the prison workforce. Valjean promptly breaks parole but later uses money from stolen silver to reinvent himself as a mayor and factory owner. Javert vows to bring Valjean back to prison. Eight years later, Valjean becomes the guardian of a child named Cosette after her mother's (Anne Hathaway) death, but Javert's relentless pursuit means that peace will be a long time coming.

LETRA "" Amor de Violeiro ""  

Moça, eu não sei falar
Coisas bonitas pra te conquistar
Eu tenho só uma viola, moça
Eu só sei cantar

Moça, eu não tenho dinheiro
Minha riqueza eu vou te contar
É o braço da viola, moça
Eu só sei cantar

Moça, se você parar um pouco pra me ouvir
Em alguns minutos vai me descobrir
Enxergar o fundo do meu coração

Moça, eu já sei que o papo agora é só ficar
Mas eu tô querendo mesmo é me casar
Se me achar careta, eu te peço perdão
Mas eu quero falar com seus pais, pedir a sua mão

E se você aceitar o amor de um violeiro
O seu coração vai ser meu paradeiro
Eu e a viola e uma eterna canção
Moça, eu não tenho pressa pra te conquistar
O braço da viola vai me consolar
Até você abrir de vez seu coração

Moça, se você parar um pouco pra me ouvir
Em alguns minutos vai me descobrir
Enxergar o fundo do meu coração

Moça, eu já sei que o papo agora é só ficar
Mas eu tô querendo mesmo é me casar
Se me achar careta, eu te peço perdão
Mas eu quero falar com seus pais, pedir a sua mão

E se você aceitar o amor de um violeiro
O seu coração vai ser meu paradeiro
Eu e a viola e uma eterna canção
Moça, eu não tenho pressa pra te conquistar
O braço da viola vai me consolar
Até você abrir de vez seu coração, é

E se você aceitar o amor de um violeiro
O seu coração vai ser meu paradeiro
Eu e a viola e uma eterna canção
Moça, eu não tenho pressa pra te conquistar
O braço da viola vai me consolar
Até você abrir de vez seu coração
Até você abrir de vez seu coração

Letra "" Olha ela ai """"

Olha Ela Aí
Vi seu coração de pedra
Virar de algodão
E o seu orgulho
Te jogar no chão 
No momento em que você me disse adeus

Você se jogou no mar
Cheio de fantasias
Você foi mudando da noite pro dia
E quando acordou viu que não era eu

Olha o que deu
Olha o que deu

Olha ela aí
Deu volta no mundo 
E parou na minha porta
E eu aqui já tô te escutando
A mais de uma hora

Olha ela aí 
Me olhando perguntou
Se ainda gosto
Querendo rasgar o papel do divórcio 
Chorando implorando 
O meu amor de volta

Letra "" Ainda to ai ""

Pensava em você 
Vivia você 
Amava você 
Era só você e eu
O nosso amor particular
O nosso jeito de amar

O tempo passou 
O mundo girou 
O sonho acabou
Você me deixou

Mal sabe o quanto eu chorei
E agora que eu superei

Aí me liga 
E me pergunta como eu tô
Aí insiste em me chamar de amor
Você não desiste quer saber aonde eu tô
Quer saber onde eu tô? 

Ainda tô aí 
Tô nessa dose que cê tá bebendo 
Tô nessa foto que você tá vendo
Sou ferida que não cicatriza ai ai ai ai 

Ainda tô aí 
Tô nessa moda que cê tá ouvindo 
Tô na saudade que cê sentindo 
Você perdeu o amor da sua vida 
Você era feliz e não sabia

Letra "" Coração Pirata "" 

Quando a paixão não dá certo
Não há porque me culpar
Eu não me permito chorar
Já não vai adiantar
E recomeço do nada sem reclamar

O meu coração pirata toma tudo pela frente
Mas a alma adivinha
O preço que cobram da gente
E fica sozinha

Levo a vida como eu quero
Estou sempre com a razão
Eu jamais me desespero
Sou dono do meu coração
Ah! O espelho me disse
Você não mudou

Sou amante do sucesso
Nele eu mando, nunca peço
Eu compro o que a infância sonhou
Se errar, eu não confesso
Eu sei bem quem eu sou
Eu nunca me dou!

Quando a paixão não dá certo
Não há porque me culpar
Eu não me permito chorar
Já não vai adiantar
E recomeço do zero sem reclamar

Quando a paixão não dá certo
Não há porque me culpar
Eu não me permito chorar
Já não vai adiantar
E recomeço do nada sem reclamar

As pessoas se convencem
De que a sorte me ajudou
Mas plantei cada semente
Que o meu coração desejou
Ah! O espelho me disse
Você não mudou

Sou amante do sucesso
Nele eu mando, nunca peço
Eu compro o que a infância sonhou
Se errar, eu não confesso
Eu sei bem quem eu sou
E nunca me dou!

Quando a paixão não dá certo
Não há porque me culpar
Eu não me permito chorar
Já não vai adiantar
E recomeço do zero sem reclamar

Quando a paixão não dá certo
Não há porque me culpar
Eu não me permito chorar
Já não vai adiantar
E recomeço do nada sem reclamar

Faço o que quero, estou sempre com a razão
Eu jamais me desespero
Sou dono do meu coração
Ah! O espelho me disse
Você não mudou!
Você não mudou!
Não mudou (nunca mudou)

Letra
Você sempre fez os meus sonhos 
Sempre soube do meu segredo 
Isso já faz muito tempo 
Eu nem me lembro quanto tempo faz 
O meu coração não sabe contar os dias 
E a minha cabeça já está tão vazia 
Mas a primeira vez ainda me lembro bem 
Talvez eu seja no seu passado 
Mais uma página 
Que foi do seu diário arrancada 
Sonho, choro e sinto 
Que resta alguma esperança 
Saudade, quero arrancar essa página 
Da minha vida 
Talvez eu seja no seu passado 
Mais uma página 
Que foi do seu diário arrancada 
Sonho, choro e sinto 
Que resta alguma esperança 
Saudade, quero arrancar essa página 
Da minha vida

Lyrics:

Where's your smile gone 'cause it don't shine no more
There's a light on but you don't open the door
When you're ready
You can tell me what's wrong

I've had trouble and
There's no hiding that
If you're struggling
Let me know where you're at
Life gets heavy
And that road can be long

When the rain comes
And the sky is falling down
In your darkest hour
When there's no one around
It won't be long
Keep your head strong
Hold on tight to me
Hold on tight, hold on

When you feel like crying
Go on let it out
Just remember
The sun is shining behind the clouds
It won't be long
'Til your pain’s gone
So hold on tight to me
Hold on tight, hold on

Sometimes a worry can 
Get the best of us
And I understand
How you could lose your trust
Let me show you that
Here is where you belong

I can be your shoulder to cry on
You will find comfort in my arms
I can be your shelter on solid ground

When the rain comes
And the sky is falling down
In your darkest hour
When there's no one around
It won't be long
Keep your head strong
Hold on tight to me
Hold on tight, hold on

When you feel like crying
Go on let it out
Just remember
The sun is shining behind the clouds
It won't be long
'Til your pain’s gone
So hold on tight to me
Hold on tight, hold on

Hold on tight to me
Hold on tight to me 
Hold on tight to me
Hold on tight to me
Hold on tight to me
Hold on tight to me
Hold on tight 
Hold on tight, hold on

When the rain comes
And the sky is falling down
In your darkest hour
When there's no one around
It won't be long
Keep your head strong
Hold on tight to me
Hold on tight, hold on

When you feel like crying
Go on let it out
Just remember
The sun is shining behind the clouds
It won't be long
'Til your pain's gone
So hold on tight to me
Hold on tight, hold on

Hold on tight to me 
Hold on tight to me 
Hold on tight to me
Hold on tight to me 
Hold on tight to me 
Hold on tight to me 
Hold on tight 
Hold on tight, hold on

New album 'All Love Everything' out now: https://aloeblacc.lnk.to/AllLoveEverything

""I Do"" is the first single off his forthcoming album. On the eve of Aloe's 10 year anniversary, he surprised his wife Maya Jupiter with a re-marriage proposal. Their ensuing wedding was the basis for this video. 

The ballad from his forthcoming album was inspired by his marriage with recording artist Maya Jupiter. For the first time, Blacc opens up about his personal life and relationships in his music. 

“Luck brought us together despite living half-way across the world with a vast ocean between us.
“I Do” is the perfect representation of the profound love we share. I wanted to create a song for Maya that was personal and universal.""

Lyrics

Thought I was good, I was good, on my own I was alright 
Thought I was grown, and the strangers I'd known they were all right
Thought that I knew everything never wrong i was all right
Oh, I was good, I was good, on my own I was alright

Oh, I lived a whole life 
thinking I knew how my 
heart could handle love
A Love I thought I knew

Everything before us 
was stretching out my heart just
So it could be big enough 
To beat for two

Never understood why
People always said love chooses you
Now I do
Now I do

Didn't ever think that 
I could ever say I promise you
And now I do
Now I do

Now I do
I do

This is the road we can see where it goes together
You are my home and I know I can stay forever

Oh, I lived a whole life 
thinking I knew how my 
heart could handle love
A Love I thought I knew

Everything before us 
was stretching out my heart just
So it could be big enough 
To beat for two

Never understood why
People always said love chooses
Now I do
Now I do

Didn't ever think that 
I could ever say I promise you
And now I do
Now I do

Now I do 
I do
Now I do
I do

Used to be a time when 
I thought that I had nothing to lose 
but now I do
Now I do

Never understood why
People always said love chooses
Now I do
Now I do

Didn't ever think that 
I could ever say I promise you
And now I do
Now I do

Lyrics

I've been sad, I've been lost 
I've been down and out and lonely 
I've been suffering at a job, in a world that tries to own me
But when I wake up every morning there's an image of a better place 
’Cause the harder that we grind 
Then the sweeter is the glory

People say I’m foolish
People say I’m blinded by faith
But if I run out of air 
If I crash I don’t care 
I’m gonna do it my way

I can make it through this
You can throw the world in my face
But the fear gives me life
And I swear 'til I die
I’m gonna do it my way
Aye, gonna do it my way
Aye, gonna do it my way

So put me down and criticize me with your lies and with your parody
In the darkness I don't hide, ’cause I got pride that gives me clarity 
I still wake up in the morning with a vision of a better life
You see the option of defeat is just not written in my story

People say I’m foolish
People say I'm blinded by faith
But if I run out of air
If I crash I don’t care 
I’m gonna do it my way

I can make it through this
You can throw the world in my face
But the fear gives me life
And I swear 'til I die
I’m gonna do it my way
Aye, gonna do it my way
Aye, gonna do it my way 

Every time they build a wall around me
I will tear it down and say
I'ma live my dreams
Gotta live my dreams

Even when the floods rush round to drown me
I just hold my breath and pray 
Let me live my dreams
Every single one of my 
I ain't quitting none of my dreams

People say I'm foolish
People say I'm blinded by faith
But if I run out of air 
If I crash I don’t care 
I’m gonna do it my way

I can make it through this
You can throw the world in my face
But the fear gives me life
And I swear 'til I die
I’m gonna do it my way
Let me fly through the air, if I crash I don't care
I’m gonna do it my way 
’Cause the fear gives me life
And I swear, 'til I die
I’m gonna do it my way

Lyrics:-

[Verse 1: Aloe Blacc]
Well, I'm just a lonesome dreamer
Traveling down a dusty road
All I have is ambition in my hand
And a heart full of hope
I can see tomorrow clearly
Feel the future in my bones
And I'll never forget those words keep ringing in my head
That mama said just before I left home

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
(Love your life) Love your life, (Live your dreams) Live your dreams
(Do your best) Do your best (At everything) At everything
(Don't give up) Don't give up, (Never stop) Never stop
(Keep on rising) Keep on rising
We gon' keep on rising



[Post-Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
We gon' keep on rising
We gon' keep on rising
We gon' keep on rising
We gon' keep on rising
We gon' keep on rising
We gon' keep on rising
To the top (To the top), to the top (To the top)
To the top
Higher and higher
To the top (To the top), to the top (To the top)
To the top

[Verse 2: Aloe Blacc]
Finally found me some direction
Now I know where I need to go
And I learned that all the answers you've been searching for my friend
Are deep within somewhere the wind will never blow

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
Just love your life (Love your life), live your dreams (Live your dreams)
Do your best (Do your best), at everything (At everything)
Don't give up (Don't give up), never stop (Never stop)
Keep on rising (Keep on rising)
We gon' keep on rising

[Post-Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
We gon' keep on rising
We gon' keep on rising
We gon' keep on rising
We gon' keep on rising
We gon' keep on rising
We gon' keep on rising
To the top (To the top), to the top (To the top)
To the top
Higher and higher
To the top (To the top), to the top (To the top)
To the top

[Bridge]
Love your life (Love your life), live your dreams (Live your dreams)
Do your best (Do your best), at everything (At everything)
Don't give up (Don't give up), never stop (Never stop)
Keep on rising (Keep on rising)
We gon' keep on rising
We gon' keep on rising
Higher and higher
Love your life (Love your life), live your dreams (Live your dreams)
Do your best (Do your best), at everything (At everything)
Don't give up (Don't give up), never stop (Never stop)
Keep on rising (Keep on rising)
We gon' keep on rising
To the top (To the top), to the top (To the top)
To the top (To the top)

Lyrics:

The wound heals but it never does
That's cause you're at war with love
You're at war with love, yeah

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruin's wooing me
Arrow holes that never close from cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid cause I know it ain't no you and me
But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding another lover's phone sends you back into the zone
With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover not a fighter on the front line with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle
Maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much
Cause I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
Cause it'll never be over, until you tell me it's over

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

You shouldn't have but you said it
(And I hope you never come back)
It shouldn't have happened but you let it
Now you're down on the ground screaming medic
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses
Shields, body armours and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win

I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop 'cause it hurts so much
And I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
Cause it'll never be over, until you tell me it's over

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

'Cause you've set me on fire
I've never felt so alive, yeah

Hoping wounds heal, but it never does
That's because you're at war with love

And I'm at the point of breaking
And it's impossible to shake it

See, you hoped the wound heals, but it never does
That's cause you're at war with love
Hope it heals, but it never does
That's cause you're at war with love!

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

These battle

Aesop Rock, Lupe Fiasco and Blockhead collaborate on Pumpkin Seeds – a project created in an effort to raise funds and awareness for two DIY skateparks in Dayton, Ohio: the Claridge DIY in Central Dayton and the Home Ave DIY in West Dayton. In addition to the digital single, the song is also available on limited 7"" vinyl. The artwork for the song was illustrated by Justin ""Coro"" Kaufman. Proceeds from this release will go towards funding the two skateparks in Dayton.

LYRICS:
AESOP:
 
Outside isn’t what it seem
It seem like nothing up the sleeve 
Until it’s something loveless digging holes to cover up with leaves 
Between you and your pumpkin seeds, and powerball, and Sunkist Peach at 1 or 1:15 AM When all you want is drugs and peace
All you get is waves and waves of uninvited company 
Ranger, cleric, hunter, thief
Druid, Vandal, huckster, Priest 
Amateur usurpers and catechism deserters, re-tuning truffle pig noses to catalytic converters  
In between the stirring creatures, I’m keen to the furthest needle drop 
Before requesting stitches, it is not that type of needle dog 
Dog, the truest unicorn of all is human at rest 
Waltzing through some hood the future forgets 
I just been cooped up in that cuckoo's nest, one phase after complaining, which depending on your frame is apathy or acclimating
Happy cutting off and jumping in and yelling someone shut the top 
It isn’t just some funyun run that got him on that “cut the lock”, it’s
 
Inside of the box is just another box 
Inside of the box is just another box 
You should probably get accustomed to the culture shock
Plot to jump behind some bushes when they cull the flock
Inside of the box is just another box 
Inside of the box is just another box
You should probably get some wind up in your mutton chops 
Note the general tone is get the dough, and fuck the ops
 
LUPE: 
Pandora has a pandora shorter sorta like a daughter 
In the core of her there is more of her, each subsequent layer has an inner and an orbiter
Corridor after corridor, a never ending meta-narrative that forever cabbages 
Inside of your word salad sandwiches a formal moral beef 
I don’t I call ‘em teeth I call ‘em oral coral reefs 
Let ‘em sink, ya still in sync the more you pry you’ll find another five
Hiding inside like a denieds ride across a border, multiplys, ya strict discarder is outrunning ya inner hoarder 
The more you excavate it, the more it just absorb her 
Can’t Art and force a Mario Cart into a Forza
Obscure ya speed limit and then record ya Porsche 
Report to court more that Zsa Zsa Gabor divorce lawyer 
According to my FOIA spit fire sword drank in a speakeasy wrote peace treaties in war paint!

Inside of the box is just another shoe
Inside of the sock is just another tube
You can put it on if your foot is long
If you find the lost legs of my journeys, tell ‘em I’m looking for ‘em 
Inside of the box is just another box
Inside of the box is just another box
The general tone is what it is, is what it’s not
Don’t be a fool, ya luck is shot 
I rigged the wheels, go gut the slots

(Letra)

Nem liga, se o banco de trás virar rave
Se eu já repeti várias vezes esse som
Daqui pras quatro é louça, a janela vai tremer na rua toda

Desculpe minha lombra
Uoooh
Foda-se a insônia
Uoooh
Pois quem dorme sonha, quem vive realiza e eu elevo o nível
Do imprevisível

Desculpe minha lombra
Minha lombra
Foda-se a insônia
Insônia
Pois quem dorme sonha, quem vive realiza
Essa porra toda

De mim se pode esperar tudo
Menos isso, que cê ta pensando agora
E o resumo, é muito mais que uma longa história pra contar
É o sabor do desprazer, e a aurora 
É como um beijo com gosto de vodka
Porque aprendi cedo a fugir da lógica
Ter como maior medo a rotina metódica
E vi que o segredo de uma vida sólida
É quebrar estatística, deixa o mundo girar
Já pensou se eu parasse naqueles dias de chuva hein
Que a lama atrapalhava, e o sol insistia em brilhar
A vida amedrontava mais do que a viela escura
Mas me provou que a loucura é só mais uma dádiva

Se o banco de trás virar rave
Se já repeti várias vezes esse som
Daqui pras quatro é louça, a janela vai tremer na rua toda

Desculpe minha lombra
Uoooh
Foda-se a insônia
Uoooh
Pois quem dorme sonha, quem vive realiza e eu elevo o nível
Do Imprevisível

Desculpe minha lombra
Minha lombra
Foda-se a insônia
Insônia
Pois quem dorme sonha, quem vive realiza e eu elevo o nível
Do Imprevisível

Estúpido até posso ser
Mas pra ser bem sincero
Não sei o que “cê” acha
Mais sei bem o que quero
Vou atrás do que importa outra parte eu espero
Hoje ganho o mundo e depois um V12 amarelo
Viva seu sonho e foda-se a insônia
A gente aprende, a gente apanha
Banco de trás é babilônia
Mais um residente dessa longa vida cigana
Caraí!
Partiu ""pro"" dia seguinte
Vai desculpando minha lombra
De um insano fim de semana
Carreta atribulada, a firma muda de cena
Incerto de perder no jogo, quando no amor já se ganha

Se o banco de trás virar rave
Se já repeti várias vezes esse som
Daqui pras quatro é louça, a janela vai tremer na rua toda

Desculpe minha lombra
Uoooh
Foda-se a insônia
Uoooh
Pois quem dorme sonha, quem vive realiza e eu elevo o nível
Do Imprevisível

Desculpe minha lombra
Minha lombra
Foda-se a insônia
Insônia
Pois quem dorme sonha, quem vive realiza e eu elevo o nível
Do Imprevisível.

(Letra)

Kamika-z

E o nosso plano
Que ontem à noite cê falou, quero saber se ainda tá rolando
Aquele plano, que a gente fingia que tudo era sonho
Huuum
Comprar uma vodka e sair sem rumo 
Fazer história e dominar o mundo
Eu e você yeh
Virar a página e esquecer de tudo

E vamos no rolê insano 
Vai se organizando
Que se não der certo
Partiu, segundo plano
A gente compra um banco
Sai legalizando
E se não der certo?

A gente foge pra Miami
Muda de nome
Compra um Mustang
parte pra outro rolê
Ou então vamos no mirante ali
Nós dois e a blunt 
Que o importante vai acontecer
De qualquer jeito é eu e você
Difícil mesmo vai ser explicar pra alguém 
Explicar pra alguém
Que ficaremos bem

O plano começa ao amanhecer
Todos verão que a gente tá feliz
Logo eles vão tentar nos deter
Cê me protege,  eu mato por você
Depois de conhecer o litoral
E viver do jeito que a gente quis
Ela é o meu equilíbrio emocional
A tempestade e o final feliz
Porque nós somos a chave, a porta é a rua
De menos promessa 
De mais aventura
A vida é só uma o medo é cadeado
Segue o plano adiante
Mas se tudo der errado
A gente foge pra Miami
Muda de nome
Compra um Mustang
parte pra outro rolê
Ou então vamos no mirante ali
Nós dois e a blunt 
Que o importante vai acontecer
De qualquer jeito é eu e você
Difícil mesmo vai ser explicar pra alguém 
Explicar pra alguém
Que ficaremos bem

Vamos ser dois loucos na gringa
Entendo se ninguém nos entender
Vamos ser dois loucos na gringa
Entendo se ninguém nos entender
Por que?

Vamos ser dois loucos na gringa
Atitude e loucura
Seu jeito insano de amar, as minhas travessuras
Sem ninguém pra atrapalhar
Sem testemunha
Só eu, você, o mar, o sol e a lua

Tribo da Periferia
Álbum: Híbrido
Ano: 2021
Música: Resiliência
(Letra)

Se meus fracassos não ensinassem tanto
Se minhas lagrimas, não põe à prova
Acho que o segredo de vencer na vida
Talvez é compreender sua dor de agora
Ninguém nasceu no topo da montanha
E a escalada sempre vai ser árdua
Só aquele que resistir o processo
Vai ter direito a vista mais fantástica
O melhor peixe é o que você pesca
A melhor caça é a que você caça
O alívio vale seu suor da testa
Porque o que vem de graça é mais sem graça
Nem sempre o mais caro é o que presta
O vinho bom não valoriza a taça
Uma atitude dispensa promessa
E o mais certo é que um dia tudo passa

Eu já consigo enxergar
O que é meu, vou buscar!
Eles não vão me parar

Logo eu?
Filho de dona Niece
Cria das ruas do agreste
Deus que me dera isso aqui
Agradecer pelo sol
Os dribles na vida cruel
Jah sempre de ter o melhor pra mim
Só observo e do nada
Morro de amores por tudo
Basta um momento oportuno
Não vivo um conto de fadas
É só um inquilino no mundo
Aqui de passagem de novo
O sol na pele é ingresso pra vida
Bem-vindo!
O choro alegre é o teor do quadro mais lindo
Aí parça você é luz que ofusca o inimigo
Por isso digo, esse cântico realmente é teu hino

O melhor peixe é o que você pesca
A melhor caça é a que você caça
O alívio vale seu suor da testa
Porque o que vem de graça é mais sem graça
Nem sempre o mais caro é o que presta
O vinho bom não valoriza a taça
Uma atitude dispensa promessa
E o mais certo é que um dia tudo passa

Eles não vão me parar",True,True,24794450.0,Not Found

(Letra)

Disse que tudo mudou
Que o rolê todo mudou
Disse que agora mudou
Que é outro mundo e mudou
Agora ela tem alma de Pipa avoada
E coração de marguerita gelada
Corpo de Patrícia, mente da quebrada
Um dia foi amada mas não adiantou nada
Descreve ser feliz, mas com outro gosto
A melhor maquiagem é o sorriso no rosto
E ela vai com o seu jeito, que ninguém entende
Mais deseja tê-la, mais almeja tê-la

Exibe esse batom, vem cá! Deixa eu ver
Que eu vou aumentar esse som, e deixa te envolver
Ela namora a lucidez, e mais uma vez
Tá louca na rua, tá solta na rua e sem nome
Sem endereço e sem telefone
Sem sono, sem compromisso
E amanhã é mais um dia de combo
Tudo mudou ela disse que coração não tem dono
E te deixa triste é preciso bem mais que abandono
Porque?

Agora ela tem alma de Pipa avoada
E coração de marguerita gelada
Corpo de Patrícia, mente da quebrada
Um dia foi amada mais não adiantou nada
Descreve ser feliz, mas com outro gosto
A melhor maquiagem é o sorriso no rosto
E ela vai com o seu jeito, que ninguém entende
Mais deseja tê-la, mais almeja tê-la

Uoô
No celular retocando o batom, vendo mensagens que acabou de ler
Uoô
Pegou Uísque e foi sem direção com aquele jeito, que ela sabe ter
E prefere ficar só, mais não sem ninguém
Disse que o amor já foi melhor, hoje melhor é viver bem

Agora ela tem alma de Pipa avoada
E coração de marguerita gelada
Corpo de Patrícia, mente da quebrada
Um dia foi amada mas não adiantou nada
Descreve ser feliz, mas com outro gosto
A melhor maquiagem é o sorriso no rosto
E ela vai com o seu jeito, que ninguém entende
Mais deseja tê-la, mais almeja tê-la
Agora ela tem alma de pipa avoada!

(Letra)

Olha o mundo conspirando
Pra destruir esse romance
Tão mutante nesse instante tá mais sólido que água

Nós pode até brigar por nada
Mas depois que a raiva passa não tem espaço pra mágoa
Eu tô voltando pra Brasília
Pra buscar essa menina que roubou a minha paz

A parceria é daquela se não mata, aleija 
Nós é f0da demais
Nós curte, cê pira, se envolve
Nós vira, não dorme, nós é f0da demais
Reprise, repete, nós pode
Nós bebe, nós é f0da demais

Ela é maluca e eu sou o rei do virote
Meu Deus aí que sorte, nós é f0da demais

E se nós junta no início da noite
É vinte quatro por doze

Ela é melhor amiga pra beber
Ela é minha conselheira no amor

Ele é o melhor motivo pra dizer
Que a diversão apenas começou

Ela é o meu tempero no rolê
É quem faz acontecer
E quando vê
Nós já virou
O resto você nem vai entender
Fazer o que, né
Mas demorô

Baby me leva, bem
Mata de inveja
Quem, não quer ver nosso bem
Baby me leva
Mata de inveja
Mata de inveja

Nós curte, cê pira, se envolve
Nós vira, não dorme, nós é f0da demais
Reprise, repete, nós pode
Nós bebe, nós é f0da demais

Ela é maluca e eu sou o rei do virote
Meu Deus aí que sorte
Nós é f0da demais

E se nós junta no início da noite
É vinte quatro por doze

Olha o mundo conspirando
Aqui cê vai ficar querendo
Porque a loucura dela é minha festa
E eu sou o vício
Conspira aí “vamo” vai vivendo
Bem no silêncio, mas progredindo

Nós é f0da demais
Nós é f0da demais

(Letra)

Ela é tipo aquela seda que salva
tipo vinho seco que adoça a alma
Como aquela guerra que transmite calma
E o sorriso simples que merece palmas

É tipo a divisao de indecisões 
O teor de uma erupção em emoções
E o caráter formado por ocasiões
E não vai ser moldado por opiniões

E o outro sou eu
O atribulado sou eu
Mas, também vem da rua
Criado sem pai, pô!
Acho que foi isso que me deixou tão sagaz, ah
Provar minha conduta, ainda é cedo demais
Mas, se hoje eu tô na guerra
É porque amanhã quero paz

E no declive
Se não tiver equilibrio, é queda livre
E tipo eu sou a bala, ela é o calibre
Pá!
Eu procuro a guerra, ela decide
Se vamos guerrear 

Ela é eclipse
Eu sou quebrada
Eu sou formação marginal, ela é magistrada
Sou o maluco que pula de ponta da ponte
Ela é o horizonte, e nós juntos se torna estrada
Ela é o erro na medida exata
Ela é jóia rara
Mais que o ouro, mais que a prata

E esse sem camisa
De Evoque e cordão
Que faz dessa avenida melhor emoção
É bem avançado o bagulho
É bem avançado, pô!
Faço do meu desande, minha direção!
Se eu pedir pra ela por uma balaclava, sabe o que ela vai dizer?
Dá nada!
E se eu pedir pra virar vinte madrugada, sabe o que ela vai dizer?

Ela é tipo aquela seda que salva
tipo vinho seco que adoça a alma
Como aquela guerra que trasmite calma
E o sorriso simples que merece palmas.

Single: Algo Íntimo
Ano: 2022
Letra:

Te observarão 
Te criticarão
Mesmo sendo simples, te invejarão
Pois não conseguirão
Então te diminuirão
E sempre no final, esses te imitarão
Tirei meu plantão
Então amanheceu, dei graças a Deus
Tenho amor e fé, mesmo que os dias são um
Seja o que o que Deus quiser
Nada acontece em vão
E tudo vai passar bem

Não quero provar pra quem desacreditou
Caminhos tortuosos passei, só eu sei
A todos nem mesmo Jesus Cristo agradou
E eu nasci pronto pra desagradar também
Ai de mim se não fosse a sequela 
Que herdei por ser favela, que só se aprende quem veio de lá
Às vezes até de joelhos
Mas com a certeza que só quem caiu tem o poder de se levantar

Era uma casa muito engraçada
Não tinha piso
Não tinha porta
Quintal de terra
A playboyzada apreciava o nascer do sol
Lá em casa “nós se preparava” pra um dia de guerra
Até o mais justo sangrou nessa terra
A vida é preciosa até aparecer quem compra
É tudo ou nada
Nem sempre ganha quem merece
Mas não esquece, você só merece quando ganha

Coisas que eu nem compreendia
Mas com o tempo eu entenderia
Vendo em pessoas vazias
No corre da vida melhor perdendo o melhor da vida

Tipo efeito borboleta
Voltar no tempo nada
Pra frente é um mistério ainda
A casa era engraçada
Alguns davam “risada”
Lá dentro o papo é sério
Porra
Filho bastardo sem pai
Neto de dona Nelcy
Conhecedor do Agreste das ruas do Buriti
Carrego o peso favela, com ela muito aprendi
Valeu a pena o empenho sem dormir
Já sei que nada será como antes
Posso viver de milhões, podem me encher de brilhantes
O sorriso de quem eu amo já é o bastante
Tenho umas fitas mais preciosas que diamante

“With You” Lyrics: 
 
[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Jay Sean, yeah
Gucci

[Chorus: Jay Sean]
Even though you know I like it, you ain't nothin' new
Even though you know I love it, I'm in love with you
I ain't tryna say I like it, girl, you know the truth
You know that I fuckin' love it, fucking 'round with you

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
That's my ride or die, I can't even lie
Shawty flyer than a pilot and got way too much to hide
What she like, Birkin bags and bikes
And she don't care about likes (Nah, nah)
Twistin' right right, oakwood pokin' out, yeah, that's what I like
Outta sight, outra mind
Keep them broke hoes out my sight
This the night, when we dim the lights, I pound with all my might
She so right, we so right, ain't no need to be your type
Got that fire, ask her what she drink, she said """"Guwop on ice""""

[Pre-Chorus: Jay Sean]
I'm sayin' you (Han)
I just get my mind off you
After the shit that we've been through (Yeah)
I just can't stop fuckin' with you
I just can't stop fuckin' with you

[Chorus: Jay Sean]
Even though you know I like it, you ain't nothin' new
Even though you know I love it, I'm in love with you
I ain't tryna say I like it, girl, you know the truth
You know that I fuckin' love it, fucking 'round with you

[Verse 2: Jay Sean]
I cannot keep doin' this, it ain't safe
I did not promise that you'd take my name
Told you from day, said that straight to your face
Can't be the one if you in second place, it's not that way
You start actin' crazy, know that I'll go MIA
Been talking Miami, you won't find me out of space
Wait, all up in our feelings, wasn't supposed to be that way
Wait, I can't escape, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jay Sean]
'Cause, baby, you (Yeah)
I just get my mind off you
After the shit that we've been through (Yeah)
I just can't stop fuckin' with you
I just can't stop fuckin' with you

[Chorus: Jay Sean]
Even though you know I like it, you ain't nothin' new
Even though you know I love it, I'm in love with you
I ain't tryna say I like it, girl, you know the truth
You know that I fuckin' love it, fucking 'round with you

[Verse 3: Asian Doll]
Fuckin' with you
Fiendin' for attention, leave niggas on read
They ain't fuckin' with you
Ran through the block, went broke, came up
Stayed down, real bitch, put the pussy on you
Dreaming 'bout cars, S6, with a Rollie on the wrist
Cute face, concrete
Girls gon' hate 'cause a bitch gon' slay too fast
Baby, just part of all my drip
'Cause I like it, I just fuck wanna fuck
He off the drugs, so please don't bite it
Feindin' for my love, that he hit me up, baby, I'm excited

[Chorus: Jay Sean]
Even though you know I like it, you ain't nothin' new
Even though you know I love it, I'm in love with you
I ain't tryna say I like it, girl, you know the truth
You know that I fuckin' love it, fucking 'round with you

[Outro: Jay Sean]
Fucking 'round with you
Fucking 'round with you
My baby
'Round with you

Jay:
Can’t nobody do it any better than the way you do
Girl you got me caught up in my feelings because it’s all about you
Guru:
Akhiyan ch paa k ni tu surma surma
Sikheya tu dass kithon turna turna,
Akhiyan ch paa k ni tu surma surma
Sikheya tu dass kithon turna turna.

Jeda suit tu paya aa, paya aa
Sab puchde ne kithon milda aa
Kaali teri gutt golmol lakk hilda aa
Dekh dekh hoyi jaanda haal bura dil da aa
Oo Kaali teri gutt golmol lakk hilda aa
Dekh dekh hoyi jaanda haal bura dil da aa
Kaali teri gutt golmol lakk hilda aa
Jay:
Girl the way you walking around you’re so inconsiderate
Everything you rocking girl you know that I’m feeling it
It’s everything that you do to me 
you break all the rules you ain’t gotta play
You know the sun can shine on you in the night and day
You put a hold on time in a sudden give me chills without touching
All these things that you do to me

Saara panga teri gall waale till da aa
Kaali teri gutt golmol lakk hilda aa
Dekh dekh hoyi jaanda haal bura dil da aa
Oo Kaali teri gutt golmol lakk hilda aa
Dekh dekh hoyi jaanda haal bura dil da aa
Surme ne lutt leya dil dil
Dil kehnda hun kalli kithe mil mil
Tere Surme ne lutt leya dil dil
Dil kehnda hun kalli kithe mil 

Ni jeda tere kol reh gaya rakhi mere dil da khyaal
Ni vekhi kithe tod na devi guru da hojuga bura haal

Jay:
Coz I’m stuck in the middle a little and didn’t do anything
Didn’t even gimme a reason but you still teasing me 
But I gotta be and I wanna be with you baby

Ni jeda tere kol reh gaya rakhi mere dil da khyaal
Ni vekhi kithe tod na devi guru da hojuga bura haal
Rabb di soun maamla dil da aa

Kaali teri gutt golmol lakk hilda aa
Dekh dekh hoyi jaanda haal bura dil da aa
Oo Kaali teri gutt golmol lakk hilda aa
Jay:
Can’t nobody do it any better than the way you do
Guru:
Kaali teri gutt golmol lakk hilda aa

Lyrics:
 
Days like this I need you closer,
To get me outta my mind,
Get me outta my mind, yeah
 
Tryna turn off my emotions,
But every time I try,
Every time I try
 
Vertigo set in till you come around,
Feels like I’m falling two feet above ground, In a world of noise you drown out the sound, Once you get me higher, no one’s gonna talk me down
 
Stay close around,
I know I let you down, but just
Don’t cut me out,
No not now, we’ll be gone too soon
 
Gone too soon
Gone too soon
 
Stay like this I'm in the moment,
Losing track of our time,
Losing track of our time, yeah
 
Days like this feel like their golden,
I want this feeling all night,
Let’s keep it going all night
 
Vertigo set in till you come around,
Feels like I’m falling two feet above ground, In a world of noise, you drown out the sound, Once you get me higher, no one’s gonna talk me down
 
Stay close around,
I know I let you down, but just
Don’t cut me out,
No not now, we’ll be gone too soon
 
Stay close around,
I know I let you down, but just
Don’t cut me out,
No not now, we’ll be gone too soon
 
Gone too soon
Gone too soon

The backstory: https://sthrow.com/allcaps 

So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty
Having me, then he told the people ""You can call me, Your Majesty!""
Keep your battery charged, you know it won't
Stick yo, and it's not his fault you kick slow
Should've let your trick ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter, Peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow (""Your mother"")
Don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
Or vice versa, whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try, villain: the worst guy
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out of square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bugaboo
It's ugly, like look at you, it's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name

And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'
The pot doubles, now they really got troubles
Madman never go pop like snot bubbles

Lyrics

Something filled up
My heart with nothing
Someone told me not to cry
But now that I'm older
My heart's colder
And I can see that it's a lie

Children, wake up
Hold your mistake up
Before they turn the summer into dust
If the children don't grow up
Our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up
We're just a million little gods causing rain storms
Turning every good thing to rust
I guess we'll just have to adjust

With my lightning bolts a glowing
I can see where I am going to be
When the reaper he reaches and touches my hand
With my lightning bolts a glowing
I can see where I am going
With my lightning bolts a glowing
I can see where I am go-going
You better look out below!",True,True,128747704.0,indie rock

Lyrics

Sleeping is giving in
No matter what the time is
Sleeping is giving in
So lift those heavy eyelids
People say that you'll die
Faster than without water
But we know it's just a lie
Scare your son, scare your daughter

People say that your dreams
Are the only things that save you
Come on baby, in our dreams
We can live our misbehaviour

Every time you close your eyes (lies, lies!)
Every time you close your eyes (lies, lies!)
Every time you close your eyes (lies, lies!)
Every time you close your eyes (lies, lies!)
Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes

People try and hide the night
Underneath the covers
People try and hide their lies
Underneath the covers
Come on hide the lovers
Underneath the covers
Come on hide the lovers
Underneath the covers
Hiding from your brothers
Underneath the covers
Come on hide the lovers
Underneath the covers

People say that you'll die
Faster than without water
But we know it's just a lie
Scare your son, scare your daughter
Scare your son, scare your daughter
Scare your son, scare your daughter

Now here's the sun, it's alright! (Lies! Lies!)
Now here's the moon, it's alright! (Lies! Lies!)
Now here's the sun, it's alright! (Lies! Lies!)
Now here's the moon, it's alright! (Lies! Lies!)
But every time you close your eyes (Lies! Lies!)
Every time you close your eyes (lies, lies!)
Every time you close your eyes (lies, lies!)
Every time you close your eyes (lies, lies!)
Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes",True,True,100156046.0,indie rock

Lyrics
I'm in the black again
Can't make it back again
We can just pretend
We'll make it home again
From everything now

[Verse 1]
Every inch of sky's got a star
Every inch of skin's got a scar
I guess that you've got everything now
Every inch of space in your head
Is filled up with the things that you read
I guess you've got everything now
And every film that you've ever seen
Fills the spaces up in your dreams
That reminds me

(Everything now
Everything now)

Every inch of road's got a sign
And every boy uses the same line
I pledge allegiance to everything now
Every song that I've ever heard
Is playing at the same time, it's absurd
And it reminds me, we've got everything now
We turn the speakers up till they break
'Cause every time you smile it's a fake!
Stop pretending, you've got…

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I want it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!)
(Everything now!)
Everything now

Every inch of road's got a town
Daddy, how come you're never around?
I miss you, like everything now
Mama, leave the food on the stove
Leave your car in the middle of the road
This happy family with everything now
We turn the speakers up till they break
'Cause every time you smile it's a fake!
Stop pretending, you've got...

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I want it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!)
(Everything now!)

'Til every room in my house is filled with shit I couldn't live without

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!)
(Everything now!)
Everything now

La La La La La La La
La La La La La La La

Stop pretending, you've got...

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I want it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live
(Everything now!)

And every room in my house is filled with shit I couldn't live without
(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live
(Everything now!)
Every inch of space in my heart is filled with something I'll never start

The ashes of everything now
And then you're black again
Can't make it back again
From everything now",True,True,119383129.0,dance-rock

Lyrics
In the suburbs, I, I learned to drive
And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys, we're leaving
You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd be fighting in a suburban war
Your part of town against mine
I saw you standing on the opposite shore
But by the time the first bombs fell
We were already bored
We were already, already bored

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again

The kids want to be so hard
But in my dreams, we're still screaming
And running through the yard
And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall
Meant nothing at all
Meant nothing at all, it meant nothing
 
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling and into the night

So can you understand
Why I want a daughter while I'm still young?
I want to hold her hand
And show her some beauty before this damage is done
But if it's too much to ask, if it's too much to ask
Then send me a son
Under the overpass
In the parking lot we're still waiting, it's already passed
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
'Cause it's already passed
It's already, already passed

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again
I'm moving past the feeling
I'm moving past the feeling
 
In my dreams we're still screaming
We're still screaming
We're still screaming",True,True,139511141.0,baroque pop

Lyrics

My body is a cage
That keeps me from dancing with the one I love
But my mind holds the key

My body is a cage
That keeps me from dancing with the one I love
But my mind holds the key

I'm standing on a stage
Of fear and self-doubt
It's a hollow play
But they'll clap anyway

My body is a cage
That keeps me from dancing with the one I love
But my mind holds the key

You're standing next to me
My mind holds the key

I'm living in an age
That calls darkness light
Though my language is dead
Still the shapes fill my head

I'm living in an age
Whose name I don't know
Though the fear keeps me moving
Still my heart beats so slow

My body is a cage
That keeps me from dancing with the one I love
But my mind holds the key

You're standing next to me
My mind holds the key
My body is a...

My body is a cage
We take what we're given
Just because you've forgotten
That don't mean you're forgiven

I'm living in an age that
Screams my name at night
But when I get to the doorway
There's no one in sight

I'm living in an age
They laugh when I'm dancing with the one I love
But my mind holds the key

You're standing next to me
My mind holds the key

Set my spirit free
Set my spirit free
Set my body free
Set my body free

Set my spirit free
Set my body free

Lyrics

And if the snow buries my, my neighborhood
And if my parents are crying
Then I'll dig a tunnel from my window to yours
Yeah, a tunnel from my window to yours
You climb out the chimney
And meet me in the middle, the middle of the town
And since there's no one else around
We let our hair grow long
And forget all we used to know
Then our skin gets thicker from
Living out in the snow
You change all the lead
Sleepin' in my head
As the day grows dim
I hear you sing a golden hymn
Then we tried to name our babies
But we forgot all the names that
The names we used to know
But sometimes, we remember our bedrooms
And our parents' bedrooms
And the bedrooms of our friends
Then we think of our parents
Well what ever happened to them?
You change all the lead
Sleepin' in my head to gold
As the day grows dim
I hear you sing a golden hymn
The song I've been trying to sing
Purify the colors, purify my mind
Purify the colors, purify my mind
And spread the ashes of the colors
Over this heart of mine",True,True,42624869.0,indie rock

故事改編自JJ不曾提起、最沉痛的一段回憶......

2012學不會，2013修煉愛情
愛情，是我們永遠的課題

有些回憶，怎麼洗都洗不掉
有些感覺，失去了就永遠回不來
每愛一次，都是一次修煉，為了下一次，我們能愛得更好

JJ林俊傑 10周年鉅獻 誠意再推薦
第10張全新專輯「因你而在」最新抒情強打「修煉愛情」Music Video
金曲獎最佳導演徐筠軒首度執導音樂動畫作品
故事改編自JJ不曾提起、最沉痛的一段回憶......

「近未來的世界，是一個沒有植物的寂寥世界
程式設計師Jean Joseph Orban (JJ飾演) 的植物學家女友
在一次例行性的探勘任務中，遭遇流星群擊中太空船，因而喪命
悲傷的Jean Joseph Orban開發了一組程式，能讓記憶轉化為虛擬可見的畫面
藉由這個程式，所有人都可以隨時再看見最思念的人
卻也因此導致了許多人沉溺在回憶裡，分不清楚現實與記憶......」

「修煉愛情」完整故事版，2013/3/13全球首映


【因你 而在 Stories Untold 專輯】

他寫下歌，成為你的故事；
而那些故事成為他的歌，為你而唱。
你們早已是共同體，在共存的世界裡循環，
就像約好的一樣，你跟林俊傑只因彼此而在。

許多不曾說過的故事，都不再保留了，
因為，未來還有更多故事等著發生。


【JJ林俊傑出道10周年第10張全新專輯】

在這張專輯中，
JJ邀請了過往10年中曾一起合作過的工作人員和演藝圈好友們，
在音樂製作、平面及影像拍攝、舞蹈方面一同參與這個10周年的特別盛會，
更有從未合作過的眾多新朋友加入，撞出未曾見過的新火花，
從2003到2013，對JJ來說，是一次里程碑，
更像是一種對未來的展望。

10年，可以是一個單位，也可以是一種約定。
從0到1，是一種過程，更是一種追逐。

林俊傑把音樂和夢想當做能量，
直到雙腳終於穩穩站上了舞台，
能成為自己是一件多不容易的事，
JJ因為擁有無數支持他的人，很幸運地，他做到了。

舞台再大，他都要記住每一雙揮舞的手，
燈光再強，他也能看清楚每一張笑臉，
因為有你，林俊傑才能成為林俊傑。

因為引力，所以相遇
因為想要，所以創造
因為夢想，所以改變
因為有你，所以林俊傑

金曲歌王 - J J 林俊傑 
2015 榮耀慶功再推出《新地球-人》1/30 重磅登場

最值得蒐藏的專輯！2015 慶功加碼再升級！
「人」　生如煙火，短暫存在卻能噴發燦爛！

新一代超人氣小天后 ─ G.E.M. 鄧紫棋
浪漫男女對唱曲─【手心的薔薇】 再創KTV對唱新經典

「手心的薔薇 刺傷而不自覺/妳值得被疼愛 你懂我的期待/絢爛後枯萎/經過幾個圓缺 /有我 (你) 在/
你埋藏的薔薇/妳動人的香味/是最好的你 (妳) 陪我 盼我 接受世界/不完美/另一面/多美」

繼傳唱全亞洲的經典男女對唱曲「小酒窩」之後，JJ又一即將攻佔KTV對唱歌曲榜的最新力作。一同精彩合唱的對象請來認識許久的好朋友 - 新一代香港小天后G.E.M.鄧紫棋，闊別已久再度創作的男女對唱曲，使合唱消息一出，紛紛在中港台等所有華語地區，引起一股熱烈討論的風潮，所有樂迷都相當期待兩人首度的合作。歌曲是以G.E.M.最喜愛的薔薇為主題，表露男女兩者互為知己，惺惺相惜的情感交融，並以頗具演唱技巧的輪唱方式，在男聲/女聲的相互交錯間，展現JJ與G.E.M.各有特色且能完美對唱的聲線。一首勢必想要立馬找好對象練唱的動人對唱情歌。

林俊傑 JJ Lin【她說】收錄於林俊傑的專輯《她說》。孫燕姿一聽到這首曲的 demo 就被深深吸引，於是寫下了歌詞 。《她說》 是金曲歌王林俊傑首張自選翻唱輯。

她說
作詞：孫燕姿 作曲：林俊傑

他靜悄悄地來過 他慢慢帶走沉默
只是最後的承諾 還是沒有帶走了寂寞
我們愛的沒有錯 只是美麗的獨秀太折磨
她說無所謂
只要能在夜裡翻來覆去的時候有寄託

等不到天黑 煙火不會太完美
回憶燒成灰 還是等不到結尾
她曾說的無所謂 我怕一天一天被摧毀

等不到天黑 不敢凋謝的花蕾
綠葉在跟隨 放開刺痛的滋味
今後不再怕天明 我想只是害怕清醒

他靜悄悄地來過 他慢慢帶走沉默

江南
作詞：李瑞洵 作曲：林俊傑

風到這裡就是黏 黏住過客的思念
雨到了這裡纏成線 纏著我們流連人世間

你在身邊就是緣 緣份寫在三生石上面
愛有萬分之一甜 寧願我就葬在這一點

圈圈圓圓圈圈 天天年年天天 的我 
深深看你的臉 生氣的溫柔 埋怨的溫柔 的臉

不懂愛恨情愁煎熬的我們 都以為相愛就像風雲的善變
相信愛一天 抵過永遠 在這一剎那凍結了時間

不懂怎麼表現溫柔的我們 還以為殉情只是古老的傳言
離愁能有多痛 痛有多濃 當夢被埋在江南煙雨中

「一年前的今天我開始了一個全新的旅程，我下了一個決心 - 卸下了對於流行音樂的包袱，重新定義我與自己的音樂。

我問了自己一個問題：音樂製作的過程，還有什麼是我還沒嘗試過的？

於是我開始了這個計畫。我希望把我內心深處許多說不出來的感觸，用琴聲，用旋律，用自己的聲音表達出來。希望這樣的舉動，能夠讓我看到一個從來未見過的自己，跟那個一直躲在自己心裡某處的自己 聊聊天，談談心。

我發現，我很久沒有好好 跟自己對話 了。」～～JJ LIN

▌首波真情流露主打「不為誰而作的歌」▌

從TRACK1的調音進入整張專輯的open，第一個場景，發生在非常浪漫的音樂廳，選擇了他出生的新加坡，濱海藝術中心的音樂廳，這是很大的突破，第一次流行藝人能夠進入這個場地，進行浩大的錄音工程，巨大的音樂廳，如何現場的音場的掌控，回音真實的融入，音響、樂手的配置，國際級的專業團隊，流行樂和由指揮家帶領的弦樂團的完美合奏，自然情感流露的聲音的第一現場的錄製，所有都是實驗性的挑戰，不為誰，只為了傳遞直達心底的聲音。

與他多年合作，也深刻了解他的音樂之路的名作詞人 林秋離 合作
，不僅寫出他內心最深處的吶喊、疑惑與感謝，也是他對音樂的致敬，將他的人生獻給音樂真摯的自白的重要作品，細緻動人的旋律，【不為誰而作的歌】更像是「為你我量身打造的歌」，唱出心底的初衷。

MV邀請合作默契絕佳的 陳映蓉 導演執導，導演 以「致 所有的無名者」揭開序幕，在影像中，呈現我們生活中每天都有可能看見的事，發生在你我周遭平凡的人事物，最平凡的真實卻最可貴，還特別邀請到黃子佼客串，一路和JJ 陪伴成長的佼哥，導演特別在影像上設計以和JJ 互動的方式，自然的帶出JJ 內心深處，他和自己對話「我寫歌」的真情流露，最後JJ 的一段O.S.，更為這張實驗專輯開啓了最具生命力的感動。


 生者互助

宇宙最渺小的一個神
正巧和那個最偉大的同名

祂們叫 「謝謝」


科技始終來自於人性，獨特的錄音方式是科技的運用，然而，在這張作品，是每一個樂器的彈奏，都在發聲著，所有我們忘了已經多久沒有去碰觸的內心；所有聲音的環繞，遠近左右就像是你我已經多久忘了抬起頭看看真實生活的周遭～～～

戴上耳機，聽見JJ和你內心的聲音，新的聲音，心的聲音。

小酒窩
作詞：王雅君 作曲：林俊傑

我還在尋找 一個依靠 和一個擁抱
誰替我祈禱 替我煩惱 為我生氣為我鬧

幸福開始有預兆 緣份讓我們慢慢緊靠
然後孤單被吞沒了 無聊變得有話聊 有變化了

小酒窩長睫毛是你最美的記號
我每天睡不著想念你的微笑
你不知道你對我多麼重要
(你不知道 多麼重要)
有了你生命完整的剛好

小酒窩長睫毛迷人的無可救藥
我放慢了步調感覺像是喝醉了
終於找到心有靈犀的美好
一輩子暖暖的好
我永遠愛你到老

那些你很冒險的夢
詞Lyricist：王雅君
曲Composer：林俊傑

當兩顆心開始震動 
當你瞳孔學會閃躲
當愛慢慢被遮住只剩下 黑 
距離像影子被拉拖  

當愛的故事剩聽說 
我找不到你單純的面孔
當生命每分每秒都為你 轉動
心多執著就加倍心痛

那些你很冒險的夢 我陪你去瘋
摺紙飛機碰到雨天 終究會墜落 
太殘忍的話我直說 因為愛很重
你卻不想懂 只往反方向走
 

當愛的故事剩聽說 
我找不到你單純的面孔 
當生命每分每秒都為你 轉動 
心有多執著 就加倍心痛

我不想放手 你鬆開的左手
你愛的放縱 我白不回天空
我輸了累了 當你再也不回頭

那些你很冒險的夢 我陪你去瘋
摺紙飛機碰到雨天 終究會墜落
太殘忍的話我直說 因為愛很重
你卻不想懂 只往反方向走 
你真的不懂 我的愛已降落
