""Christmas, Why Can't I Find You?"" is a song co-written by James Horner and Will Jennings for the movie How the Grinch Stole Christmas in 2000. In the movie, it is first sung by Taylor Momsen, who played Cindy Lou Who.

A longer and different version of this song, called ""Where Are You, Christmas?"", was co-written by Mariah Carey, James Horner and Will Jennings. The song was originally recorded by Carey, but because of a legal case with her ex-husband Tommy Mottola, it could not be released, so it was re-recorded and released by Faith Hill. A video was released featuring Hill singing from the Grinch's mountaintop home, interspersed with clips from the film and a cameo appearance by Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Are_You,_Christmas%3F

Where are you Christmas 
Why can't I find you 
Why have you gone away 
Where is the laughter 
You used to bring me 
Why can't I hear music play 

My world is changing
I'm rearranging
Does that mean Christmas changes too

Where are you Christmas
Do you remember
The one you used to know
I'm not the same one
See what the time's done
Is that why you have let me go

Christmas is here
Everywhere, oh
Christmas is here
If you care, oh

If there is love in your heart and your mind
You will feel like Christmas all the time

I feel you Christmas
I know I've found you
You never fade away
The joy of Christmas
Stays here inside us
Fills each and every heart with love

Where are you Christmas
Fill your heart with love",False,False,40872084.0,country music

Whut? Thee Album is the debut album from New Jersey Hip Hop artist Redman. Redman had only rapped on record prior to this album on EPMD's Business As Usual and Business Never Personal. EPMD's Erick Sermon produced the majority of the album, but Redman also handled much production.

This effort was a major success and established Redman as one of the premier hip hop artists of the 90's. It only reached #49 on the Billboard 200 in 1992, but was certified Gold by the RIAA on June 11, 1993. It is commonly hailed for its upbeat, sample driven funky production and its humorous lyrics. The record was originally given a rating of 4.5 mics out of 5 in The Source in November 1992. In 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums.

Reginald ""Reggie"" Noble was born and raised in Newark, New Jersey. In 1990 Reggie made his world debut on the EPMD album Business as Usual appearing on tracks ""Hardcore"" and ""Brothers My Jock"". In 1992 Redman released his debut album, Whut? Thee Album, which Allmusic noted for blending ""reggae and funk influences"" with a ""terse, though fluid rap style"".The album peaked at number forty-nine on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold. He was named ""Rap Artist of the Year"" by The Source. Redman followed up with his 1994 album, Dare Iz a Darkside. The first single, ""Rockafella,"" samples Leon Haywood's ""I Want'a Do Something Freaky to You"" and George Clinton's ""Flashlight,"" two of the most sampled songs in hip hop.

Redman's solo career continued throughout the remainder of the decade, with each of his albums selling at least half a million copies. His musical style has remained very consistent, rarely deviating from a combination of unique braggadocious wit and hard hitting beats. Redman is also the originator of the pop-culture gesture, ""Raise the Roof"", due to the gesture being performed in the video, ""Pick It Up"" from his 1996 album, ""Muddy Waters"". In addition to releasing albums under his own name, he is part of the group Def Squad (along with Keith Murray and Erick Sermon) with whom he released the 1998 album El Niño, and also has formed a close partnership with labelmate Method Man (of the Wu-Tang Clan) who, with him, made a featured appearance with the Dogg Pound in Tupac Shakur's 1996 album All Eyez on Me in the rap song Got My Mind made up where both rapped with Kurupt in verse two and Meth also did the chorus, and with whom he released the 1999 album Blackout!.

Redman had his best-known international hit with Christina Aguilera, when he was featured on her 2002 single ""Dirrty"". Around this time he was also featured on a popular remix of Pink's track Get This Party Started. Since the release of Malpractice, he has kept his fans happy by independently releasing the Ill At Will mixtapes, which feature various members of his Gilla House crew, including Saukrates and Icarus. Other members under Redman's Gilla House imprint include Ready Roc, E3, Young Heat, and Melanie. Under his birthname, Reggie Noble, Redman has done production for himself, many of his crew members, and even Shaquille O'Neal on his 'Shaq-Fu: Da Return' album.

In March 2007, Redman released Red Gone Wild. He says that the reason for the long wait to drop the album is because of the fast-changing pace of Hip Hop on his MySpace interview.

On March 27, 2007 Redman confirmed on BET's Rap City: Tha Bassment that the sequel to How High, How High 2, is currently being written.

In an April 10, 2007 Onion AV Club interview [4], Redman hinted that there would be a second collaborative album with Method Man, with work beginning in midsummer or early September.

In early 2008, a remake of the Smoothe da Hustler and Trigger tha Gambler classic Broken Language was released to the internet by the duo entitled Broken Language 2008, fueling rumors of a Blackout! sequel coming soon. This rumor was further fueled by the duo while performing in Gainesville, FL at the University of Florida. A Blackout! 2 LP was scheduled for a December 9, 2008 release but was recently pushed back to the first quarter of '09. With a new release date on May 19, also a sequel to the very popular How High is in the process of being written and is to begin being filmed in the summer of '09. Bun B has confirmed that he will guest star on Blackout! 2 - in April 2009, a single has been released named City Lights, produced by Nasty Kutt. Also producers such as Erick Sermon, Rockwilder and Pete Rock have announced their presence on the album.

The duo is also currently on their Still High tour with Termanalogy, the Alchemist, & Evidence of Dilated Peoples.

Lyrics:
[Intro: Redman + Method Man]
Yo, ladies and gentlemen
We got Toni Braxton up in the house
So high that I can kiss the sky, bitch
We live up in here, y'all; let's get high!
Motherfucker, get high!

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Tical shittin' again, spittin' to win
Loaded guns, clip in the end, none sicker than him
Yes, indeed, I'm ill as any STD's or sex disease
These dirty rats want extra cheese
On that piece of the pie
Now ask me ""How high?"", I'll tell you ""Reach for the sky!""

Blame the Crooked Letter I
That's my home, 23's wrapped in chrome
Not only snap on y'all niggas but I'll snap them bones
Clap your dome, make you leave that crack alone
You got the key to the city but the latch is on?
I gots it locked, bringin' the noise, bringin' the Funk
Doctor Spock, bringin' my boys, bringin' you lungs
Pop the Glock, but only if you feel this shit
Jack the Ripper; don't make me have to kill this bitch!
Back to get ya, put it in check, that's the Mista
Meth with his wood on your neck, shut your lips up

[Hook: Toni Braxton + Method Man & Redman]
I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get

[Verse 2: Redman]
You can call on the man when the party is borin'
I'll have these hoes strippin' till it's part of the mornin'
I love a fat chick with a body enormous
It ain't about the weight, yo, it's how they performin'
My dash is 180, my weed half a pound
When the smoke in the air my nose like basset hounds
I don't stash the 'dro, nigga, divide
I'm that nigga that ride with trigger to give a supply
High is how I stay all the time
(Method Man: Niggas, close your doors!)
Yo, bitches, shut all your blinds!
If I'm hard to find, take two puffs and pass
I stay back, but my Benz moved up a class
It's Doc and Meth, the format is real sickenin'
Contagious, we out for Mr. Biggs' women
You better shut your trap when my dogs around
We pissin' on fire hydrants, so walk around, bitch!

[Hook: Toni Braxton + Method Man & Redman]
I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Mista Method Man, puttin' in work, foot in the dirt
Like it's all good, roll through your hood, pushin' a hearse
I wish y'all would come around like Clint Eastwood
As if you're reppin' your hood in my neck of the woods
Street gorillas in the PJ's, grimy bitch
I wear the same shit for three days, find me lit
Blunt sparks, like Phillippi; fuck the he-say, the she-say!
Adjust the microphone, plus the cliché

[Verse 4: Redman]
Yo, call me the Bob Backlund
I'll break backs on hoes that look like Toni Braxton
Come run with these boney masked men
I'm out the gutter, I'm out to send your baby mother
Out for rubbers; we fuckin' tonight
Bitches wanna crowd around, how I'm cuffin' the mic
I'm a gorilla, leave a banana stuck in your pipe
‘Cause I'm a real block winner, the Doc inna
Bitch, one of my balls bigger than the Epcot Center!

[Hook: Toni Braxton + Method Man & Redman]
I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get

Lyrics:
[Intro: Redman + Method Man]
Yo, ladies and gentlemen
We got Toni Braxton up in the house
So high that I can kiss the sky, bitch
We live up in here, y'all; let's get high!
Motherfucker, get high!

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Tical shittin' again, spittin' to win
Loaded guns, clip in the end, none sicker than him
Yes, indeed, I'm ill as any STD's or sex disease
These dirty rats want extra cheese
On that piece of the pie
Now ask me ""How high?"", I'll tell you ""Reach for the sky!""

Blame the Crooked Letter I
That's my home, 23's wrapped in chrome
Not only snap on y'all niggas but I'll snap them bones
Clap your dome, make you leave that crack alone
You got the key to the city but the latch is on?
I gots it locked, bringin' the noise, bringin' the Funk
Doctor Spock, bringin' my boys, bringin' you lungs
Pop the Glock, but only if you feel this shit
Jack the Ripper; don't make me have to kill this bitch!
Back to get ya, put it in check, that's the Mista
Meth with his wood on your neck, shut your lips up

[Hook: Toni Braxton + Method Man & Redman]
I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get

[Verse 2: Redman]
You can call on the man when the party is borin'
I'll have these hoes strippin' till it's part of the mornin'
I love a fat chick with a body enormous
It ain't about the weight, yo, it's how they performin'
My dash is 180, my weed half a pound
When the smoke in the air my nose like basset hounds
I don't stash the 'dro, nigga, divide
I'm that nigga that ride with trigger to give a supply
High is how I stay all the time
(Method Man: Niggas, close your doors!)
Yo, bitches, shut all your blinds!
If I'm hard to find, take two puffs and pass
I stay back, but my Benz moved up a class
It's Doc and Meth, the format is real sickenin'
Contagious, we out for Mr. Biggs' women
You better shut your trap when my dogs around
We pissin' on fire hydrants, so walk around, bitch!

[Hook: Toni Braxton + Method Man & Redman]
I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Mista Method Man, puttin' in work, foot in the dirt
Like it's all good, roll through your hood, pushin' a hearse
I wish y'all would come around like Clint Eastwood
As if you're reppin' your hood in my neck of the woods
Street gorillas in the PJ's, grimy bitch
I wear the same shit for three days, find me lit
Blunt sparks, like Phillippi; fuck the he-say, the she-say!
Adjust the microphone, plus the cliché

[Verse 4: Redman]
Yo, call me the Bob Backlund
I'll break backs on hoes that look like Toni Braxton
Come run with these boney masked men
I'm out the gutter, I'm out to send your baby mother
Out for rubbers; we fuckin' tonight
Bitches wanna crowd around, how I'm cuffin' the mic
I'm a gorilla, leave a banana stuck in your pipe
‘Cause I'm a real block winner, the Doc inna
Bitch, one of my balls bigger than the Epcot Center!

[Hook: Toni Braxton + Method Man & Redman]
I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get

Lyrics:

When we turn out the lights
The two of us alone together
Something's just not right
But girl you know that I would never ever let another's touch
Come between the two of us
Cause no one else will ever take your place

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl, to me
And you'll always be, eternally
Everytime I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl with just a touch, you can do so much

No one else comes close",True,True,32895117.0,Not Found

Lyrics:

Hey, love
You say you need someone
To be there for you
To love you all night long, huh
It's kinda funny but
I don't think you have to look no further
Because I'm right here
And I'm ready
To do all the things your man won't do

Tell me what kind of man
Would treat his woman so cold
Treat you like you're nothin'
When you're worth more than gold

Girl, to me you're like a diamond
I love the way you shine
A hundred million dollar treasure
I'll give the world to make you mine",True,True,49614907.0,Not Found

Lyrics:

Girl I'm so tired of things
I just wanna settle down
I swear to you I've changed
Baby why you buggin out
I know that I put you through hell
You deserve to be with someone else
But I gotta be straight up
Straight up
Girl I just wanna kiss and make up
We done been through a lot of things
How do you throw that away
You were the heart of me
Can't believe you'd let it break
Tell me why you won't let em go

You can say what you want but I know
Baby no more lies
I'ma keep it real this time

Help me understand
What I'm saying ain't getting through
Why I can't be your man
When I'd give up the world for you
Girl I'll do the best I can
Love you forever that's what I'd do
If I was your man",True,True,29708074.0,Not Found

Want you to know that I'm willing too.
And where you want me to go girl
I'll be willing to go there for you.

I'll be willing to spend the night
All you gotta say is please stay Joe
And I'll be staying as long as you saying...

CENNET (Şarkı Sözleri)

Ben gözü görmeyene resim gösteremem
Değerimi bilmeze değer öğretemem
O önce, e haddini öğrensin
Biten sevgiye imrenip özenemem
Boş sözü duyup düstur edinemem
Eden, kendine ah etsin

Bildim lakin söyleyemem
Gördüm ama izah edemem
Dünya, senle baş edemem ben
Zaman öyle de geçecek
Hayat böylede bitecek
E bitsin, umudum cennetten

Sevdim, kaç kere bilemem
Yaşadım, yok inkar edemem
Bıktım, senle baş edemem
Zaman öyle de geçiyor
Hayat böyle de bitiyor
Ama umudum cennetten

Hani fani bu hayat ümit bağlayamam
Olmadı diye oturup ağlayamam
Gönlü geniş olan sükutu öğrensin
Sevgimi yok yere ele bağlayamam
Gelir mi diye hayallere sığınamam
Kemale eren kendinden versin

Sevdim, kaç kere bilemem
Yaşadım, yok inkar edemem
Bıktım, senle baş edemem ben
Zaman öyle de geçiyor
Hayat böyle de bitiyor
Ama umudum cennetten

Ben dalkavuk olanı hizaya getiremem
Sorma bana ben görünmezi göremem
Merak eden kendine yönelsin
Boş yere kimseyi oyalayıp üzemem
Geçici şeylere heves edip üzülemem
Fikrim, hevesimi alt etsin

Sevdim, kaç kere bilemem
Yaşadım, yok inkar edemem
Bıktım, senle baş edemem ben
Zaman öyle de geçiyor
Hayat böyle de bitiyor
Ama umudum cennetten

Şarkı Sözleri:
Kapkara gözlerle, yaktın sineden 
Aşkınla tutuşup, yandım çingenem 
Ruhumu koparıp, aldın bedenden 
Uğruna sararıp, soldum çingenem 

Karanlık gecede, ateşin başında
Takınır zilleri, oynar çingenem 
Savurur saçlarını, esen rüzgarla 
Bir deli sevdaya, salar çingenem 

Çingenem, çingenem 
Kara gözlü çingenem 
Aşkınla tutuşup 
Yandım çingenem 
Çingenem, çingenem 
Kara gözlü çingenem 
Uğruna sararıp soldum çingenem

YAPARIM BİLİRSİN (Şarkı Sözleri)

Engel mi mesafeler aşk yoluna meşk yoluna
Değer mi sebepsizken ayrılığa
Baş koydum ben seninle mutlu
Aşk yoluna meşk yoluna
Bulurum Kaf dağına kaçsan da

Aşıklar anlar benim her halimi sevdiğimi
Dünyada bensiz bırakmam seni
Yalnızlar anlar benim her halimi sevdiğimi
Hayatta terk etmem seni
Yaparım bilirsin…

Deliyim gözü kara deliyim
Yakarım Romayı da yakarım ben
Bulurum seni yine bulurum
Olurum yine senin olurum

Yaparım bilirsin…

Vital fue ver el futuro y volver.
Llega el tiempo de retroceder. All right!

De vuelta al '84
Voy a cantar como cantaba el Gato.
La escuela de papa U-Roy y Prince Jazzbo 
""Deejay style"" el original dancehall.

Bem dirili bom, bem dirili bom, bim!
Bem dirili bom come dirili bom skank
No puedes negarme q se siente bien!
Bem dirili bom come dirili bom

Digo saca, prende y sorprende.
Déjame probar, yo sé que tienes verde.
Desde acá la veo casi fosforecente.
Eso no se pierde aquí ni por accidente.

Digo saca, prende y sorprende. 
Fumando es como la gente se entiende,
esa ultra voz de la conciencia no miente
aunque los otros cinco sentidos lo intenten. 

Saca, prende y sorprende.
Nunca hemos sido de seguir la corriente.
Deja que'l perico otras narices reviente
que por acá seguimo' alimentando la mente.

Digo saca, prende y sorprende! x4

Bem dirili bom, bem dirili bom, bim
Bem dirili bom come dirili bom skank
No puedes negarme q se siente bien
Bem dirili bom come dirili bom

Digo saca prende y sorprende.
Es tiempo de que nos hablemos de frente.
En Uruguay se sentó un precedente,
más que necesario, el cambio es inminente.

Digo saca, prende y sorprende.
De esta lucha siempre hemos estado en el frente.
Civilizadamente desobedientes,
aunque aparentemos ser los locos de siempre.

Digo saca, prende y sorprende.
No es que no importe lo que piense la gente,
es que poco a poco trastoquemos las mentes
hasta que se concientice el continente. 

Digo saca, prende y sorprende x4

Bem dirili bom, bem dirili bom, bim!
Bem dirili bom come dirili bom skank
No puedes negarme q se siente bien.
Bem dirili bom come dirili bom

¡Me cansé, me cansé de comprar me cansé!
Desde ahora pa' alante lo que hay es crecer
una, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco matas, o seis...
Si aquí hay Monsanto ya no creo en la ley.
No tiene peso lo que me diga el juez.
Vamos a virar la balanza al revés.
con siete, ocho, nueve matas, o diez...
Voy para adentro pero digo otra vez:

¡Me cansé, me cansé de comprar me cansé!
Desde ahora pa' alante lo que hay es crecer.
Esa guerra antidrogas es un juego 'e poder
letal la DEA y el cartel.
A más dinero, más armamento.
El crimen simplemente sigue en aumento.
Muy bien comprendo cómo es que muere el pez,
pero lejos del miedo te lo digo otra vez:
¡Me cansé, me cansé de comprar me cansé!
Desde ahora pa' alante lo que hay es crecer.
¡Me cansé, me cansé de comprar me cansé!
¡Me cansé, de comprar me cansé!

Digo saca, prende y sorprende.
Déjame probar, yo sé que tienes verde.
Desde acá la veo casi fosforecente.
Eso no se pierde aquí ni por accidente.

Digo saca, prende y sorprende. 
Fumando es como la gente se entiende,
esa ultra voz de la conciencia no miente
aunque los otros cinco sentidos lo intenten. 

Digo saca, prende y sorprende.
Nunca hemos sido de seguir la corriente.
Deja que la coca otras narices reviente
que por acá seguimo' alimentando la mente.

Digo Saca, prende y sorprende x4

Bem dirili bom, bem dirili bom, bim!
Bem dirili bom come dirili bom skank
No puedes negarme q se siente bien.
Bem dirili bom come dirili bom skank
Bem dirili bom, bem dirili bom, bim!
Bem dirili bom come dirili bom skank
No puedes negarme q se siente bien.
No puedes negarme q se siente bien.

LETRA / LYRICS: 

Qué necesidad tenías 
De tratar de aparentar 
Tan sencillo que sería hablar con la verdad 
Yo tampoco te pedía
Que durará toda la eternidad 
Solamente que me hablaras claro 
Antes de continuar 

Olvídate de mis canciones 
Yo te devuelvo tus promesas 
Que no cumpliste ni una de ellas 
Y yo que te creí 
Olvídate de mis canciones
 Y si algún día te arrepientes 
Sal a buscar entre la gente 
Los besos que te di 

Creí haber ganado contigo 
Pero ha pasado tanto tiempo y fue más lo que yo perdí 
Te dije te quiero 
Tu me prometiste el cielo 
Y tu bien sabes lo que al final recibí 

Lo que no me diste 
Te fuiste y lo conseguí 
Solita yo me lo di 
Por lo que no hiciste hoy te doy gracias a ti 

Olvídate de mis canciones 
Yo te devuelvo tus promesas 
Que no cumpliste ni una de ellas 
Y yo que te creí 
Olvídate de mis canciones 
Y si algún día te arrepientes
 Sal a buscar entre la gente 
Los besos que te di 

Y las flores que arrojé
A tus pies cuando te creí 
Fueron para una mujer 
Que idealice 
Esa que elaboraste de ti 
Yo iba de besos y flores 
Tu de falsas promesas
 Y si alguien aquí perdió 
No he sido yo 
No he sido yo 
Olvídate, olvídate de mí 

Olvídate de mis canciones 
Yo te devuelvo tus promesas 
Que no cumpliste ni una de ellas
Y yo que te creí 
Olvídate de mis canciones
Y si algún día te arrepientes 
Sal a buscar entre la gente 
Los besos que te di 

Olvídate, olvídate de mí 
Olvida la ruta que lleva a mi casa 
Y la llave oculta si por aquí pasas 
Te lo advierto 
Olvídate, olvídate de mí

Letra: Willy Rodríguez, Leonel Rosa y Julio Colón
Arreglo e interpretación: Cultura Profética

Letra: 
Para estar, para estar

Puede que para este ciego, tu prisma sea el remedio
Basta conocer las notas que componen tus arpegios
Puede ser que andarte cerca me mate de calor
Si es que soy un pajarito, simple pajarito, que se está
Acercando al sol

Puede que tus besos me hagan delirar
Y suelen ser tus labios el mejor lugar para estar, para estar
Para estar, para estar

Prometo besar cada lunar que hace lugar en tu cuerpo
Perder la cuenta y comenzar de nuevo
Gozar y desearte, reflexionar este juego
Tirar los dados e intentar algo nuevo
Puedo jurar nunca olvidar que fuimos viento
Que fuimos monte, fuimos mar, fuimos cielo
Llegar a ese lugar donde asentar mis fundamentos
Hacernos vida y ya dejarnos de cuentos

Puede que tus besos me hagan delirar
Y suelen ser tus labios el mejor lugar para estar, para estar
Para estar, para estar

Como una hamaca, una almohada en tus besos
Descanso de estos días intensos
El mejor lugar para redimirme, no existe duda de que…

Puede que tus besos me hagan delirar
Y suelen ser tus labios el mejor lugar para estar, para estar
Para estar, para estar
Puede que tus besos me hagan delirar
Y suelen ser tus labios el mejor lugar para estar, para estar
Para estar, para estar.

Música y Letra: Willy Rodríguez
Interpretado por Cultura Profética
Disco: La Dulzura (2010)
Dirección: Felipe Sepúlveda, Claudio Medina, Darwin Norvak
Dirección de Fotografía: Felipe Sepúlveda
Producción Ejecutiva: Soraya Abdouni

Letra: 
Te veo llegar cada día
Como a esta hora
Y he tomado ya como costumbre
Sentarme a esperar pa' ver si alcanzo a tener
Un vistazo de tu piel
Por eso, sigo fiel
Cada día en la espera
Tomando tus gestos
Como madriguera
Que tu tranquilidad me equaliza
Y ya quiero conocer
Lo que te mueve
Eso que te hace ser
Tan intensa mujer de expresión tan sincera
Y vuelan, las horas vuelan
Y vuela el pensamiento con la intriga
Como mariposas vuelan en la barriga
Y vuelan, los días vuelan
Mil oportunidades pa' conocerte vuelan
Pero yo, ya le cogí el gustito a la espera

Te veo llegar cada día
Y cuando demoras
Me entra una ansiedad que palpita
Y toda la sangre se me hace miel
Cuando te llego a ver
Tan bella como ayer
Vuelvo y te miro bien
Y te encuentro más bella
Es raro, lo acepto de alguna manera
Pero en realidad es distinto
En ti veo luces que no veré
Dudas que no sabré
Cosas sencillas que
Me encantaría tener una vida completa
Pero vuelan, las horas vuelan
Y vuela el pensamiento con la intriga
Como mariposas vuelan en la barriga
Y vuelan, los días vuelan
Mil oportunidades pa' conocerte vuelan
Pero yo, ya le cogí el gustito a la espera.

Lyrics:

And it's been awhile
Since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile
Since I first saw you
And it's been awhile
Since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile
Since I could call you

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means

And it's been awhile
Since I can say that I wasn't addicted
And it's been awhile
Since I can say I love myself as well
And it's been awhile
Since I've gone and fucked things up just like I always do
And it's been awhile
But all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again

Why must I feel this way?
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day!

And it's been awhile
Since I could look at myself straight
And it's been awhile
Since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile
Since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile
But I can still remember just the way you taste

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem to be I know it's me
I cannot blame this on my father
He did the best he could for me

And it's been awhile
Since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile
Since I said I'm sorry",True,True,243252259.0,post-grunge

Lyrics: 

And you
Can bring me to my knees
Again
All the times
That I could beg you please
In vain
All the times
That I felt insecure
For you
And I leave
My burdens at the door

But I'm on the outside
I'm looking in
I can see through you
See your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly
You're ugly like me
I can see through you
See to the real you

All the times
That I felt like this won't end
It's for you
And I taste
What I could never have
It was from you
All the times
That I've cried
My intentions
Full of pride
But I waste
More time than anyone

But I'm on the outside
And I'm looking in
I can see through you
See your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly
You're ugly like me
I can see through you
See to the real you

All the times
That I've cried
All this wasted
It's all inside
And I feel
All this pain
Stuffed it down
It's back again
And I lie
Here in bed
All alone
I can't mend
But I feel
Tomorrow will be OK

But I'm on the outside
And I'm looking in
I can see through you
See your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly
You're ugly like me
I can see through you
See to the real you",True,True,117803221.0,post-grunge

Lyrics:
I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you sometime
And I want to spend some time with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

We look for love, no time for tears
Wasted water's all that is
And it don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait
Not for those who wait too late
We gotta go for all we know

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
Building them castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

I hear the crystal raindrops fall
On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
And, darling, when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I want to be the one with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
Building big castles way on high
Just the two of us
You and I

(Just the two of us)
Yes, the two of us
(We can make it just the two of us)
Let's get it together, baby
(Just the two of us)
Yes, the two of us
(We can make it just the two of us
Just the two of us
We can make it just the two of us
Just the two of us
We can make it just the two of us
Just the two of us
We can make it just the two of us
Just the two of us
We can make it just the two of us
Just the two of us
We can make it just the two of us
Just the two of us
We can make it just the two of us
Just the two of us)

Lyrics:

You've got your ball
you've got your chain
tied to me tight tie me up again
who's got their claws
in you my friend
Into your heart I'll beat again

Sweet you rock
and sweet you roll

Does his teeth bite to eat and he's rolling
Never changes a thing
The week ends the week begins

Wondering what the other is thinking

Lyrics:

Where are you going, with your long face pulling down?
Don't hide away, like an ocean
But you can't see, but you can smell
And the sound of waves crash down

I am no Superman
I have no reasons for you
I am no hero, oh that's for sure
But I do know one thing
Is where you are, is where I belong
I do know, where you go is where I wanna be

Where are you going, where do you go?
Are you looking for answers to questions under the stars?
Well, if along the way you are growing weary,
You can rest with me until a brighter day
And you're okay",True,True,26640301.0,rock music

Lyrics:

You cannot quit me so quickly
There's no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you, love

The Space Between
The tears we cry
Is the laughter keeps us coming back for more
The Space Between
The wicked lies we tell
And hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again?

Like 'Will it rain today?'

Fleas and ticks jump everywhere
'Cause of original sin
Down the hill fell Jack and Jill
And you came tumbling after

Rip away the tears
Drink a hope to happy years
And you may find
A lifetime's passed you by

Lyrics:

Hey, my love
I came to you with best intentions
You laid down and gave to me
Just what I'm seeking
Love, you drive me to distraction

Hey my love do you believe
That we might last a thousand years
Or more if not for this, our flesh and blood
It ties you and me right up
Tie me down

Celebrate we will
Because life is short but sweet for certain
We're climbing two by two
To be sure these days continue
These things we cannot change

Hey, my love, you came to me
Like wine comes to this mouth
Grown tired of water all the time
You quench my heart
And you quench my mind

Celebrate we will
Because life is short but sweet for certain
We're climbing two by two
To be sure these days continue
The things we cannot

Celebrate, you and me
Climbing two by two
To be sure these days continue
These things we cannot change

Oh, my love I came to you
With best intentions
You laid down and gave to me
Just what I'm seeking

Celebrate we will
Because life is short
But sweet for certain
We're climbing two by two
To be sure these days continue

Lyrics:

Oh look at how she listens
She says nothing of what she thinks
She just goes stumbling through her memories
Staring out on to Grey Street

She thinks, ""Hey,
How did I come to this?
I dream myself a thousand times around the world,
But I can't get out of this place""

There's an emptiness inside her
And she'd do anything to fill it in
But all the colors mix together - to grey
And it breaks her heart",True,True,18460782.0,rock music

Lyrics: 

I say my hell is the closet I'm stuck inside
Can't see the light
And my heaven is a nice house in the sky
I got central heating and I'm alright
Yeah yeah yeah can't see the light
Keep it locked up inside don't talk about it
T-t-talk about the weather
Yeah yeah yeah can't see the light
Open up my head and let me out little baby
'Cos here we have been standing for a long long time
Treading trodden trails for a long long time

I say my hell is the closet I'm stuck inside
Can't see the light
And my heaven is a nice house in the sky
I got central heating and I'm alright
'Cos here we have been standing for a long long time
Treading trodden trails for a long long time, time, time, time, time, time, time

I find sometimes it's easy to be myself
Sometimes I find it's better to be somebody else

I see you young and soft oh little baby
Little feet, little hands, little feet, little feet, little baby
One year of crying and the words creep up inside
Creep into your mind yeah

Lyrics:
Winter's cityside, crystal bits of snowflakes
All around my head and in the wind
I had no illusions that I'd ever find a glimpse of
Summer's heatwave in your eyes

You did what you did to me, now, it's history I see
Here's my comeback on the road again
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight
It's easy when you're big in Japan

Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight, big in Japan, be tight
Big in Japan, ooh, the eastern sea's so blue
Big in Japan, alright, pay then I'll sleep by your side
Things are easy when you're big in Japan
Oh, when you're big in Japan

Neon on my naked skin
Passing silhouettes of strange illuminated mannequins
Shall I stay here at the zoo? Or should I go
And change my point of view for other ugly scenes?

You did what you did to me, now, it's history I see
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight
It's easy when you're big in Japan

Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight, big in Japan, be tight
Big in Japan, ooh, the eastern sea's so blue
Big in Japan, alright, pay then I'll sleep by your side
Things are easy when you're big in Japan

Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight, big in Japan, be tight
Big in Japan, ooh, the eastern sea's so blue
Big in Japan, alright, pay then I'll sleep by your side
Things are easy when you're big in Japan
Oh, when you're big in Japan

Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight, big in Japan, be tight
Big in Japan, ooh, the eastern sea's so blue
Big in Japan, alright, pay then I'll sleep by your side
Things are easy when you're big in Japan

Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight, big in Japan, be tight
Big in Japan, ooh, the eastern sea's so blue
Big in Japan, alright, pay then I'll sleep by your side
Things are easy when you're big in Japan
Oh, when you're big in Japan

En un principio se llamaban Forever Young, pero a la hora de sacar el primer disco, decidieron llamarse Alphaville. La composición original del grupo estaba formada por los siguientes artistas: Marian Gold (pseudónimo de Hartwig Schierbaum), Bernhard Lloyd y Frank Mertens. Este último, ante la presión del éxito del primer disco, no aguantó y abandonó el grupo. A partir de 1982 empezaron a publicar sencillos como ""Big in Japan"" y ""Forever Young"", pero no sería hasta 1984, y después del rotundo éxito de sus dos sencillos, cuando publicasen su primer álbum. La salida de Mertens en diciembre de 1984, provocó el inmediato fichaje de Ricky Echolette; el primer disco con él en el grupo y segundo de Alphaville sería Afternoons In Utopia en junio del 86 precedido del éxito del tema ""Dance With Me"".

the backstory to ""From Where You Are"":

performed by Jason Wade, a member of a band named Lifehouse. Mr. Wade was inspired to write the song by the death of a 16-year-old friend in an auto accident.

The commercial dramatizes the issue by showing a highway crowded with cars ­- filled with teenage passengers -­ that suddenly disappear. ""Every year, nearly 6,000 teenagers go for a drive and never come back,"" says the actor Dennis Haysbert, the Allstate spokesman. He asks the parents watching the spot to ""start the conversation"" with their teenage children about driving safely.

SOUVENIR
作詞・作曲：藤原基央
編曲：BUMP OF CHICKEN ＆ MOR


恐らく気付いてしまったみたい
あくびの色した毎日を
丸ごと映画の様に変える
種と仕掛けに出会えた事

仲良くなれない空の下
心はしまって鍵かけて
そんな風にどうにか生きてきた
メロディが重なった

小さくたっていい　街のどんな灯よりも
ちゃんと見つけられる　目印が欲しかった

この目が選んだ景色に　ひとつずつリボンかけて
お土産みたいに集めながら続くよ　帰り道
季節が挨拶くれたよ　涙もちょっと拾ったよ
どこから話そう　あなたに貰った　この帰り道

歩いて歩いて　時々なんか急いで　あなたに向かう道を
走って走って　いやいややっぱ歩いて　あなたに向かう道を


こうなるべくしてなったみたい
通り過ぎるばっかの毎日に
そこにいた証拠を探した
メロディが繋がった

そうしてくれたように　手を振って知らせるよ
迷わないでいいと　言ってくれたように

どこからどんな旅をして　見つけ合う事が出来たの
あなたの昨日も明日も知らないまま　帰り道
土砂降り　一体何回くぐって　笑ってくれたの
月より遠い世界から辿ってきた　帰り道

歩いて歩いて　いつの間にか急いで　あなたに向かう道を
走って走って　恥ずかしくなって歩いて　あなたに向かう道を


この目が選んだ景色に　ひとつずつリボンかけて
お土産みたいに集めながら続くよ　帰り道
季節が挨拶くれたよ　涙もまた拾っちゃったよ
どこから話そう　あなたに貰った　この帰り道

どこからどんな旅をして　見つけ合う事が出来たの
あなたの昨日と明日が空を飾る　帰り道
この目が選んだ景色に　とびきりのリボンかけて
宇宙の果てからだろうと辿っていく　帰り道

歩いて歩いて　転んで平気なふりして　あなたに向かう道を
走って走って　胸いっぱいで歩いて　あなたに向かう道を

クロノスタシス
作詞・作曲：藤原基央
編曲：BUMP OF CHICKEN ＆ MOR


もう一度ドアを開けるまで
ノルマで生き延びただけのような今日を
読まない手紙みたいに重ねて
また部屋を出る

明け方　多分夢を見ていた
思い出そうとはしなかった
懐かしさが足跡みたいに
証拠として残っていたから

大通り
誰かの落とした約束が
跨がれていく

この街は居場所を隠している
仲間外れ達の行列
並んだままで待つ答えで
僕は僕を　どう救える

飾られた古い絵画のように
秒針の止まった記憶の中
何回も聞いた　君の声が
しまっていた言葉を　まだ　探している


ビルボードの上　雲の隙間に
小さな点滅を見送った
ここにいると教えるみたいに
遠くなって消えていった

不意を突かれて思い出す
些細な偶然だけ　鍵にして
どこか似たくしゃみ　聞いただとか
匂いがした　その程度で

臆病で狡いから
忘れたふりをしなきゃ
逃げ出しそうで

例えば未来　変えられるような
大それた力じゃなくていい
君のいない　世界の中で
息をする理由に応えたい

僕の奥　残ったひと欠片
時計にも消せなかったもの
枯れた喉を　振り絞って
いつか君に伝えたいことがあるだろう


それっぽい台詞で誤魔化した
必要に応じて笑ったりした
拾わなかった瞬間ばかり　どうしてこんなに
今更いちいち眩しい


この街は居場所を隠している
仲間外れ達の行列
並んだままで待つ答えで
僕は僕を　どう救える

僕の奥　残ったひと欠片
時計にも消せなかったもの
枯れた喉を　振り絞って
いつか君に伝えたいことが

失くしたくないものがあったよ
帰りたい場所だってあったよ
君のいない　世界の中で
君といた昨日に応えたい

飾られた古い絵画のように
秒針の止まった記憶の中
鮮明に繰り返す　君の声が
運んできた答えを　まだ
しまっていた言葉を　今　探している

天体観測
作詞・作曲：藤原基央
編曲：BUMP OF CHICKEN & MOR


午前二時　フミキリに　望遠鏡を担いでった
ベルトに結んだラジオ　雨は降らないらしい

二分後に君が来た　大袈裟な荷物しょって来た
始めようか　天体観測　ほうき星を探して

深い闇に飲まれないように　精一杯だった
君の震える手を　握ろうとした　あの日は

見えないモノを見ようとして　望遠鏡を覗き込んだ
静寂を切り裂いて　いくつも声が生まれたよ
明日が僕らを呼んだって　返事もろくにしなかった
「イマ」という　ほうき星　君と二人追いかけていた

気が付けばいつだって　ひたすら何か探している
幸せの定義とか　哀しみの置き場とか

生まれたら死ぬまで　ずっと探している
さぁ　始めようか　天体観測　ほうき星を探して

今まで見つけたモノは　全部覚えている
君の震える手を　握れなかった痛みも

知らないモノを知ろうとして　望遠鏡を覗き込んだ
暗闇を照らす様な　微かな光　探したよ
そうして知った痛みを　未だに僕は覚えている
「イマ」という　ほうき星　今も一人追いかけている

背が伸びるにつれて　伝えたい事も増えてった
宛名の無い手紙も　崩れる程　重なった

僕は元気でいるよ　心配事も少ないよ
ただひとつ　今も思い出すよ

予報外れの雨に打たれて　泣きだしそうな
君の震える手を　握れなかった　あの日を

見えてるモノを見落として　望遠鏡をまた担いで
静寂と暗闇の帰り道を　駆け抜けた
そうして知った痛みが　未だに僕を支えている
「イマ」という　ほうき星　今も一人追いかけている

もう一度君に会おうとして　望遠鏡をまた担いで
前と同じ　午前二時　フミキリまで駆けてくよ
始めようか　天体観測　二分後に君が来なくとも

「イマ」という　ほうき星

君と二人追いかけている

Hello,world!
作詞・作曲：藤原基央
編曲：BUMP OF CHICKEN & MOR


扉開けば　捻れた昼の夜
昨日どうやって帰った　体だけが確か
おはよう　これからまた迷子の続き
見慣れた知らない　景色の中で

もう駄目って思ってから　わりと何だかやれている
死にきらないくらいに丈夫　何かちょっと恥ずかしい
やるべきことは　忘れていても解る
そうしないと　とても苦しいから

顔を上げて　黒い目の人
君が見たから　光は生まれた

選んだ色で塗った　世界に囲まれて
選べない傷の意味はどこだろう
ご自分だけがヒーロー　世界の真ん中で
終わるまで出突っ張り　ステージの上
どうしよう　空っぽのふりも出来ない

ハロー　どうも　僕はここ

覚えてしまった感覚　思い出とは違う類
もっと涙の側にあって　いつも心臓掴まれていて
充分理解出来ている　ずっとそれと一緒
そうじゃないと　何も見えないから

息を繋ぐ　生きる強い人
止まる心を　引き摺って連れてきた

塞いだ耳で聴いた　虹の様なメロディー
砕けない思いが内側で歌う
隠れていたってヒーロー　守るものがある
恐いのは　それほど気付いているから

扉開けば　捻れた本当の嘘
空っぽのふりのふり　体だけが確か

おはよう　今でもまだ最後の続き
叫ぼう　そこから　どうも　僕はここ

さあ目を開けて　君は強い人
その目が見たから　全ては生まれた

選んだ色で塗った　世界に囲まれて
選べない傷の意味はどこだろう
ご自分だけがヒーロー　守ったものがある
恐いのは　その価値を知っているから

塞いだ耳で聴いた　虹の様なメロディー
砕けない思いが内側で歌う
悲鳴をあげたヒーロー　世界の真ん中で
終わるまで出突っ張り　自分が見ている
だからもう　死んだふりも意味ない

ハロー　どうも　僕はここ

BUMP OF CHICKEN「アカシア」

作詞・作曲：藤原基央
編曲：BUMP OF CHICKEN & MOR

透明よりも綺麗な　あの輝きを確かめにいこう
そうやって始まったんだよ　たまに忘れるほど強い理由

冷たい雨に濡れる時は　足音比べ　騒ぎながらいこう
太陽の代わりに唄を　君と僕と世界の声で

いつか君を見つけた時に　君に僕も見つけてもらったんだな
今　目が合えば笑うだけさ　言葉の外側で

ゴールはきっとまだだけど　もう死ぬまでいたい場所にいる
隣で　（隣で）　君の側で　魂がここだよって叫ぶ
泣いたり笑ったりする時　君の命が揺れる時
誰より　（近くで）　特等席で　僕も同じように　息をしていたい


どんな最後が待っていようと　もう離せない手を繋いだよ
隣で　（隣で）　君の側で　魂がここがいいと叫ぶ
そして理由が光る時　僕らを理由が抱きしめる時
誰より　（近くで）　特等席で　僕の見た君を　君に伝えたい

君がいる事を　君に伝えたい

そうやって始まったんだよ

なないろ
作詞・作曲：藤原基央
編曲：BUMP OF CHICKEN ＆ MOR


闇雲にでも信じたよ　きちんと前に進んでいるって
よく晴れた朝には時々　一人ぼっちにされちゃうから

ヤジロベエみたいな正しさだ
今この景色の全てが　笑ってくれるわけじゃないけど
それでもいい　これは僕の旅

昨夜の雨の事なんか　覚えていないようなお日様を
昨夜出来た水たまりが　映して　キラキラ　キラキラ
息をしている

高く遠く広すぎる空の下　おはよう　僕は昨日からやってきたよ
失くせない記憶は傘のように　鞄の中で出番を待つ

手探りで今日を歩く今日の僕が　あの日見た虹を探すこの道を
疑ってしまう時は　教えるよ
あの時の心の色


胸の奥　君がいる場所　ここでしか会えない瞳
ずっと変わらないままだから　ほっとしたり　たまに目を逸らしたり

思い出すと寂しいけど　思い出せないと寂しい事
忘れない事しか出来ない　夜を越えて　続く僕の旅

治らない古い傷は　無かったかのように隠す　お日様が
昼間の星と同じだね　本当は　キラキラ　キラキラ
この街中に

歯磨きして顔洗って着替えたら　いつもと同じ足で出かけようぜ
相変わらずの猫背でもいいよ　僕が僕を笑えるから

涙の砂　散らばる銀河の中　疲れた靴でどこまでだっていける
躓いて転んだ時は　教えるよ
起き方を知っている事


乾いて消える水たまりが　それでも　キラキラ　キラキラ
青く揺れる

高く遠く広すぎる空の下　おはよう　僕は昨日からやってきたよ
失くせない記憶も傘のように　鞄の中で明日へ向かう

手探りで今日を歩く今日の僕が　あの日見た虹を探す今日の僕を
疑ってしまう時は　教えるよ　あの時の心の色

いつか　また会うよ　戻れないあの日の　七色

お別れしたのはもっと　前の事だったような
悲しい光は封じ込めて　踵すり減らしたんだ

君といた時は見えた　今は見えなくなった
透明な彗星をぼんやりと　でもそれだけ探している

しょっちゅう唄を歌ったよ　その時だけのメロディーを
寂しくなんかなかったよ　ちゃんと寂しくなれたから

いつまでどこまでなんて　正常か異常かなんて
考える暇も無い程　歩くのは大変だ
楽しい方がずっといいよ　ごまかして笑っていくよ
大丈夫だ　あの痛みは　忘れたって消えやしない

理想で作った道を　現実が塗り替えていくよ
思い出はその軌跡の上で　輝きになって残っている

お別れしたのは何で　何のためだったんだろうな
悲しい光が僕の影を　前に長く伸ばしている

時々熱が出るよ　時間がある時眠るよ
夢だと解るその中で　君と会ってからまた行こう

晴天とはほど遠い　終わらない暗闇にも
星を思い浮かべたなら　すぐ銀河の中だ
あまり泣かなくなっても　靴を新しくしても
大丈夫だ　あの痛みは　忘れたって消えやしない

伝えたかった事が　きっとあったんだろうな
恐らくありきたりなんだろうけど　こんなにも

お別れした事は　出会った事と繋がっている
あの透明な彗星は　透明だから無くならない

◯×△どれかなんて　皆と比べてどうかなんて
確かめる間も無い程　生きるのは最高だ
あまり泣かなくなっても　ごまかして笑っていくよ
大丈夫だ　あの痛みは　忘れたって消えやしない

大丈夫だ　この光の始まりには　君がいる

新世界
作詞・作曲：藤原基央
編曲：BUMP OF CHICKEN & MOR


君と会った時　僕の今日までが意味を貰ったよ


頭良くないけれど　天才なのかもしれないよ
世界がなんでこんなにも　美しいのか分かったから

例えば　曲がり角　その先に君がいたら
そう思うだけでもう　プレゼント開ける前の気分

泣いていても怒っていても　一番近くにいたいよ
なんだよそんな汚れくらい　丸ごと抱きしめるよ
ベイビーアイラブユーだぜ　ベイビーアイラブユーだ
ちゃんと今日も目が覚めたのは　君と笑うためなんだよ


ハズレくじばかりでも　君といる僕が一等賞
僕はこれが良いんだ　何と比べても負けないんだ

世界はシャボン玉で　運良く消えていないだけ
すぐ素直になれるよ　それが出来るように出来ている

天気予報どんな時も　僕は晴れ　君が太陽
この体　抜け殻になる日まで　抱きしめるよ
ベイビーアイラブユーだぜ　ベイビーアイラブユーだ
君と会った時　僕の今日までが意味を貰ったよ


もう一度眠ったら　起きられないかも
今が輝くのは　きっと　そういう仕掛け
もう一度起きたら　君がいないかも
声を聞かせてよ
ベイビーアイラブユーだぜ


ケンカのゴールは仲直り　二人三脚で向かうよ
いつの日か　抜け殻になったら　待ち合わせしようよ
ベイビーアイラブユーだぜ　ベイビーアイラブユーだ
昨日が愛しくなったのは　そこにいたからなんだよ

泣いていても怒っていても　一番近くにいたいよ
どんなに遠く離れても　宇宙ごと抱きしめるよ
ベイビーアイラブユーだぜ　ベイビーアイラブユーだ
明日がまた訪れるのは　君と生きるためなんだよ

僕の今日までが意味を貰ったよ

作詞・作曲：藤原基央
編曲：BUMP OF CHICKEN & MOR


目的や理由のざわめきからはみ出した　名付けようのない時間の場所に
紙飛行機みたいに　ふらふら飛び込んで　空の色が変わるのを見ていた

遠くに聞こえた　遠吠えとブレーキ　一本のコーラを挟んで座った
好きなだけ喋って　好きなだけ黙って　曖昧なメロディー　一緒になぞった

やりたい事がないわけじゃないはずだったと思うけど
思い出そうとしたら　笑顔とため息の事ばかり

ねぇ　きっと
迷子のままでも大丈夫　僕らはどこへでもいけると思う
君は知っていた　僕も気付いていた　終わる魔法の中にいた事


昨日と似たような繰り返しの普通に　少しずつこっそり時間削られた
瞬きの向こうに　いろいろいくつも　見落としたり　見落としたふりしたり

あれほど近くて　だけど触れなかった　冗談と沈黙の奥の何か
ポケットには鍵と　丸めたレシートと　面倒な本音を　つっこんで隠していた

固まって待ったシャッター　レンズの前で並んで
とても楽しくて　ずるくて　あまりに眩しかった

そして今
想像じゃない未来に立って　相変わらず同じ怪我をしたよ
掌の上の　動かない景色の中から　僕らが僕を見ている


目的や理由のざわめきに囲まれて　覚えて慣れて　ベストを尽くして
聞こえた気がした　遠吠えとブレーキ　曖昧なメロディー　一人でなぞった

言葉に直せない全てを　紙飛行機みたいに
あの時二人で見つめた　レンズの向こうの世界へ　投げたんだ

想像じゃない未来に立って　僕だけの昨日が積み重なっても
その昨日の下の　変わらない景色の中から　ここまで繋がっている

迷子のままでも大丈夫　僕らはどこへでもいけると思う
君は笑っていた　僕だってそうだった　終わる魔法の外に向けて

今僕がいる未来に向けて

Aurora
作詞・作曲：藤原基央
編曲：BUMP OF CHICKEN & MOR


もうきっと多分大丈夫　どこが痛いか分かったからね
自分で涙拾えたら　いつか魔法に変えられる

ほんの少し忘れていたね　とても長かった　ほんの少し
お日様がない時は　クレヨンで世界に創り出したでしょう

正義の味方には見つけて貰えなかった類
探しに行かなくちゃ　呼び合い続けた　あの声だよ

溜め息にもなれなかった　名前さえ持たない思いが
心の一番奥の方　爪を立てて　堪えていたんだ
触れて確かめられたら　形と音が分かるよ
伝えたい言葉はいつだって　そうやって見つけてきた


振り返れば途切れずに　歪な線を描く足跡
悲しいくらい分かりやすく　いつもここに向けて伸びる

大切にするのは下手でも　大切だって事は分かっている
せめてその白い手紙が　正しく届きますように

考え過ぎじゃないよ　そういう闇の中にいて
勇気の眼差しで　次の足場を探しているだけ

解き放て　あなたの声で　光る羽根与えた思いを
その足が向かうべき先へ　そうしなきゃ見えなかった未来へ
諦めなかった事を　誰よりも知っているのは
羽ばたいた言葉のひとつひとつ　必ず届きますように


もう一度　もう一度　クレヨンで　好きなように
もう一度　さあどうぞ　好きな色で　透明に
もう一度　もう一度　クレヨンで　この世界に
今こそ　さあどうぞ　魔法に変えられる

ああ、なぜ、どうして、と繰り返して　それでも続けてきただろう
心の一番奥の方　涙は炎　向き合う時が来た
触れて確かめられたら　形と音をくれるよ
あなたの言葉がいつだって　あなたを探してきた

そうやって見つけてきた

All Stars (Lyrics)

We're all stars
We are one
We light up the night
Like a black sun

We all shine
We are chrome
And we are shimmering
Turn on, turn on [Come on come on]

Play it loud
We don't care
And dance like there’s nobody there

Light up the night, Yeah light up the night, every night
Cuz we are shimmering
Turn on, turn on 

We kiss and we don’t tell
Spin like a carousel
Don’t like it, go to hell 
This is our favourite song 

Lights on everybody
We party legendary
High on sound and fury
Hey, Turn on now

Lyrics:
Worlds moving so slow
Got my hand out the window
Lose track of time and memory
Losing my mind in the palm trees
Got me believing you’re so shy
You’ll catch me looking and you’ll hide your eyes
Leaving behind your reality
We can let go the formalities

You know we should be

(Dancing)
Tell me that you wanna go
(Dancing)
You and me in stereo
(Dancing)
Intoxicated, this is how we wanna be
You and I we gotta keep
(Dancing)
Straight out in the afterglow
(Dancing)
Juliet and Romeo
(Dancing)
Intoxicated, this is how we wanna be
Don’t stop hiding x2

Worlds moving so slow
Got my hand out the window
Lose track of time and memory
Losing my mind in the palm trees

You know we should be

(Dancing)
Tell me that you wanna go
(Dancing)
You and me in stereo
(Dancing)
Intoxicated, this is how we wanna be
You and I we gotta keep
(Dancing)
Straight out in the afterglow
(Dancing)
Juliet and Romeo
(Dancing)

Intoxicated, this is how we wanna be
Don’t stop hiding

Baby you know we should be

(Dancing) x3
Intoxicated, this is how we wanna be
Don’t stop hiding
