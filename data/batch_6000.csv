LYRICS:

a growing sickness in the heart
defective, lack of control
the cure is somewhere in the silence
but I’m crushed by the noise inside 
 
don’t lock the door on me
you’d kill me, face down, dead
another part of me falls for you
 
another day in the dark
stranded in the night, stranded in the cold 
 
don’t lock the door on me
you’d kill me, face down, dead
another point of view gone to waste
please hear me out!
you kill me, face down, dead
another day in the dark

quit moaning about fate and change
stand up on your feet and rise
with every fall you get the pain, you learn the lesson
start now, open your eyes
 
dead bodies falling from the sky
we are the ape with the vision of the killing
a rain of shame that fills the mines 
no other blood in me but mine
 
time to open your eyes to this genocide
when you clear your mind you see it all
you’re receiving the gold of a better life
when you change yourself, you change the world
 
your heart is pounding in the brain
as they drag you naked in the mud
a devil’s dancing in the rain
how could you fall so low?
 
no! we will never let go!
let us watch them die!

The flood on earth again
I have to find the whales

To dry lands of life

Under the heavy sea
I'll search the flight of whales

Beneath the seas I searched
And had a different view
Of us on earth
The sinking ship of men
But it's beyond the stars
I found the place
Where they were
And they finally came to light

Over the winds
They dwell in light
Like the arrow in the sky
I found myself on higher grounds
From up here
For I see them always in flight

Now I can see the whales
Looming out of the dark
Like arrows in the sky
I can't believe my eyes
But it's true

Huge tunnel ends in light
Like banks of clouds they gather
See massive shape of flesh
Swimming giants in the clear
The mightiest comes to me
I'm on the wing, wide open
They teach me how to fly
Slowly moving in the air

They dance

Powerful presence for only speech

Incite a riot, put yourself in a trance
You rotate the frame in a world you rely on
A scar, a line has been drawn in the sand
Behold the life, the boundaries fools will crush
 
The greatest miracle
Is burning to the ground
 
Onto the next stage of the plan
Mourn the witness of the wind
A hand full of thunder
Will rise one last time
 
There’s fire in the sky
You’re in the Amazon
The greatest miracle
Is burning to the ground
 
Godly Amazonia
Bloody Amazonia
Mighty Amazonia
Killing Amazonia
 
Burn the land
Learn the end
 
Burn
Another Gold mine is unveiled
The source of our sorrow
Learn
Embedded in these walls of green
Is the curse that we follow
There’s fire in the sky

LYRICS

So long I've been trying to match
It doesn't work
I'm trying, I don't know
the aberration of this world
I tried to deal with
It killed a part of me that was raging
The pain is gone, the denial
I ran away from institutions
I owe my self life
There's no way I will respond to this passion 
Anger flowing through me
There is light in this world I fight for
The reason you won't leave this cage, betray your child
The desire that you once had to reveal yourself
Forget to create your own life

Anger
Lies
Denial

The righteous anger boiling inside us
Won't last forever
Don't fear to let is out
Branches have grown through
The wolf is your master 
The sky is all over me
I run on time.",True,True,35732510.0,progressive metal

LYRICS

Before all things reborn again
You learn the painful breath of time
Cold mourning stretches out your arms
To the mighty warmth of the golden sun
Seem all have gone insane for gold
All was created out of the night
We're all born from the burst of a star

The day you'll come to life you'll realize
Expanding force to life where you belong
And in the winter cold, with opened eyes
You'll find the strength to fight and stand upright
One day you'll walk the world and keep in mind
The heart you've been given in winter time
And through the bitter cold, with opened eyes
You'll find the strength to fight and stand upright",True,True,19006181.0,progressive metal

Rap — like physics — is fundamentally a mathematical discipline

However, Mos Def's masterful jaunt into numerology rests mainly on analysis of sociological statistics

From 1999 Album: ""Black On Both Sides""

Born Dante Terrell Smith on December 11, 1973, in Brooklyn, NY, Mos Def began rapping at age nine and began professionally acting at age 14, when he appeared in a TV movie. After high school, he began acting in a variety of television roles, most notably appearing in 1994 on a short-lived Bill Cosby series, The Cosby Mysteries. In 1994 Mos Def formed the rap group Urban Thermo Dynamics with his younger brother and sister, and signed a recording deal with Payday Records that didn't amount to much. In 1996 his solo career was launched with a pair of high-profile guest features on De La Soul's ""Big Brother Beat"" and Da Bush Babees' ""S.O.S."" A year later, in 1997, Mos Def released his debut single, ""Universal Magnetic,"" on Royalty Records, and it became an underground rap hit. This led to a recording contract with Rawkus Records, which was just getting off the ground at the time, and he began working on a full-length album with like-minded rapper Talib Kweli and producer Hi-Tek. The resulting album, Black Star (1998), became one of the most celebrated rap albums of its time. A year later came Mos Def's solo album, Black on Both Sides, and it inspired further attention and praise. Yet, aside from appearances on the Rawkus compilation series Lyricist Lounge and Soundbombing, no follow-up recordings were forthcoming, as the up-and-coming rapper turned his attention elsewhere, away from music.

During the early 2000s, Mos Def acted in several films (Monster's Ball, Bamboozled, Brown Sugar, The Woodsman) and even spent some time on Broadway (the Pulitzer Prize-winning Topdog/Underdog). He simultaneously worked on the Black Jack Johnson project with several iconic black musicians: keyboardist Bernie Worrell (Parliament/Funkadelic), guitarist Dr. Know (Bad Brains), drummer Will Calhoun (Living Colour), and bassist Doug Wimbish (the Sugarhill Gang, Grandmaster Flash, Living Colour). This project aimed to reclaim rock music, especially the rap-rock hybrid, from such artists as Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst, who Mos Def openly despised. What made Black Jack Johnson so anticipated though was not so much the supergroup roster of musicians or even Mos Def himself, but rather the lack of black rock bands. Following the demise of Living Colour, there were few, if any, that had attained substantial success. Mos Def hoped to infuse the rock world with his all-black band, and during the early 2000s, he performed several small shows with his band around the New York area. In October 2004, he finally delivered a second solo album, The New Danger, which involved Black Jack Johnson on a few tracks.

Two years later, after a few more acting roles — including the Golden Globe-winning Lackawanna Blues and the Emmy-winning Something the Lord Made, both of which were made-for-television movies — Mos Def released his third solo album, True Magic (2006). A contract-fulfilling release for Geffen, which had absorbed Rawkus years prior, the album trickled out in a small run during the last week of 2006. Bizarrely, the disc came with no artwork and was sold in a clear plastic case — though its single, ""Undeniable,"" did manage to grab a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance. The Ecstatic, released on the Universal-distributed Downtown label, followed in June 2009; at that point, Mos Def had significant acting roles in Michel Gondry's Be Kind Rewind (in which he co-starred with Jack Black) and Cadillac Records (he played Chuck Berry).

[Watch it]
Relax, pump the brakes
You're speeding money
You'll smash your whole shit up [slow down]
Lights be changing fast on these streets money, slow down
[slow down] Sleeping on the wrong cats

Clear like a megaphone
Pretty nigga heart skipped the metronome
Rocked the Trump Tower to the terrordome
Poor house to pleasure domes
Soprano, alto, tenor to baritone
MOS DEF one of the illest that you ever known
Rock steady baby, you a stepping stone
Smash your foundation into pebbles
My words leave your nerves unsettled
You take it to the next level down
Looking like a circus clown
Cats like you can't even get a pound
Worldwide from the river to lakeside
My stage show stay live, make the sound man stage dive
I cut fat cats to eight lives with my eight ball lines
I'm home 'fore I'm done with all nine
Got you shook like a fault line
Come all shine and get tarnished
Brooklyn got your pay roll garnished
They form a huddle
Whisper like they want trouble
I melt the ice grills into rainwater puddles
Make the proud-hearted leave on the humble
Black steel in the hour
Assemble my skill form my power
My poems crush bones into powder
You mumble like a coward
I'm Mos Def, you need to speak louder
SUPER HEREOE!
Get your power, your masks and capes snatched
Brooklyn take what you can't take back
I know a lot of cats hate that
All I can say black
There's a city full of walls you can post complaints at
All the doubters and believers adjust your receivers
[I feel it] you can taste it through the speakers
The three six oh-riginal sketch lyrics so visual
They rent my rhyme books at your nearest home video

Tell them cats they need to sit back and observe where they at
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on
Put your joint on cruise
Try to rush you scuff your brake shoes, just cool and relax
Take a breath, take ten paces back
Stay on time Omegas
Brooklyn patrol like interstaters
Take their license and their registration papers

My joint's so passionate
Make you peal out and mash your shit
Get wild cold crash your whip
Front chassis wrecked, but ock you can't be too upset
Tow truck got my tape in the deck
I'm permanent like tattoos and birth marks
Third degree burn marks
Driving on tracks like Dale Earnheart
Stay on the low like the earth spot
Put a big loss on your earn chart
Nice since the nurse signed my birth chart
Seldom seen but often heard, while your jams is barely heard
Just my name is a daily word
From avenues to streets, terraces and park places
Stair wells, jail cells, penthouse to basements
Arrangement basic, but still fans chase it
Y2K can't delete the true ancient
Apache war drum on the ranges
Skill level dangerous
Arrow head that killed all the cavemen
They cry John-Blazing, but step on the pavement
And get violated like a plaintiff
I ain't shit to play with
I give a Goddamn what your name is
Delete it and make it so it never get repeated
Believe it
Tell the feds, tell your girl, tell your mother
Conference call you wack crew and tell each other
That they just ain't holding me
I'm Mos Def, your hopefully
Mush off or you get bust off like a ovary

Tell them cats they need to ease back and observe where they at
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on
Put your joint on cruise
In a rush you scuff your brake shoes, just cool and relax
Take a breath, take ten paces back
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on, no off-ramp or detour
Make these gassed up jokers observe the speed law
Make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law
Make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law
Cause they speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin,
speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin,
speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin
Relax
Slow down, you better chill money
Lights be changing fast on these streets dude
Smash your whole shit up
You better cool out money
It ain't like that out here
Look at these cats man, it's funny man
He probably just got that car
About to fuck your whole shit up
Speed laws out here money
Knight riding cats
In control like interstaters, state-ahs, state-ahs...
state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs,
state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs,

Right here is where the end gon' start at,
conflict, contact 'n' combat,

settle the dispute about who the livest,

Whoever survive this,
only one of us can ride forever,
so you and I cant ride together,
can't live or cant die together,
all we can do is collide together,
so I skillfully apply the pressure,
won't stop until I'm forever... one!

A door step where death never come,
spread across time til my time never done,
and I'm never done,
walk tall, why ever run?

bad man never fret the war, tell'em come

hardheaded and unresponsive,
get they lives put on target with harshness,
come with the canons sparkin' they darken,
who am i? one man squadron,
Ma stir the fire this time that'd snatch your tomorrow,
the thousand yard spear that'll pierce through your armor,
you can get it on right now if you want to,

Chorus:
Broken the paradigm, an example must be set
Invoke the siren's song and sign the death warrant
This is what has been wrought for 30 pieces of silver
The tongues of men and angels bought by a beloved betrayer

I am the result, what's better left unspoken
Violence begins to mend what was broken
You've been talking, I've been all ears

Lyrics: 
By the darkest river, beneath the leafless trees 
I think I’m drowning, this dream is killing me 
In the coldest winter, between the fading lights 
I feel I’m falling into a frozen sky 
Past the blackest heaven, above the dying stars 
I watch me breaking into a million shards 
But through the hardest hour, below the cruelest sign 
I know I’m waking up from this wretched lie 
Wake up. 

A depression fed by overload 
False perceptions, the weight of the world 
A universe in the palm of your hand 
The artifice of endless strands. 

Distraction flows down an obsessive stream 
Rejection grows into oppressive screams. 

The hardest hour, the cruelest sign 
I’m waking up from this wretched lie 
I fight it the same, don’t waste this day 
Wake up, wake up, wake up 
Memento mori. 

The regression of advancing modes 
And Imperial corrosive nodes 
A prime directive to disconnect 
Reclaim yourself and resurrect. 

Distraction flows down an obsessive stream 
Rejection grows into oppressive screams. 

The hardest hour, the cruelest sign 
I’m waking up from this wretched lie 
I fight it the same, don’t waste this day 
Wake up, wake up, wake up memento mori. 

There’s too many choices 
And I hear their relentless voices 
But you’ve gotta run them out 
Return to now and shut it down. 

A depression fed by overload 
False perceptions, the weight of the world 
Because there’s too many choices 
Gotta kill their relentless voices. 
Wake up.

AND NO LOVE LEFT IN YOU, ONLY PAIN

BLEEDING IN YOUR ECHO CHAMBER
A CRIMSON HALL OF DIRTY MIRRORS
HAIR-TRIGGER FINGERTIPS ILLUMINATE YOUR EVERY CONFLICT
ALL EYES ON YOU, BUT NOTHING’S CLEARER

WEAPONIZING SUFFERING, THE LICKS YOU NEVER HAD
TRAUMA ECHOES STOLEN FROM THE SHOULDERS OF THE PAST
SELF-INFLICTED AGONIES TO BUILD A BLIND DEFENSE 
THE TEARS OF TITANS CURRENCY IN YOUR INCOMPETENCE 

NO JUSTICE, ONLY REVENGE
NO LOVE LEFT, ONLY THE PAIN

WHINES OF OPPORTUNITY TO STACK THE FICTION HIGH
DEMONIZE ALL SCRUTINY TO SELL THE TRUTH A LIE
SPITTING IN A GIANT’S FACE TO SET YOUR PAST ABLAZE
REJECTING YOUR INHERITANCE TO WEAR ANOTHER’S FACE

BIRTHRIGHTS 
COMPROMISED
DROP THE CURTAIN ON YOUR PAST
THE SELF YOU SO DESPISE

NO JUSTICE, ONLY REVENGE
NO LOVE LEFT, ONLY THE PAIN

BIRTHRIGHTS 
WEAPONIZED

YOU WILL LOVE EACH OTHER

Lyrics: 
In every movie I watch from the '50s
There's only one thought that swirls
Around my head now
And that's that everyone there on the screen
Yeah, everyone there on the screen
Well, they're all dead now
They're all dead now

And it ain't easy living above
And I can't help but keep falling in love
With bones and ashes
With bones and ashes
And when the color is too bold and bright
I'm daydreaming in black and white
Until it passes
Until it passes

I wanna know the measure
From here to forever
And I wanna feel the pressure
Of God or whatever

Oh, these days it's so hard to relax
You gotta hold a gun to my back
To make me smile
To make me smile
And the only way I seem to cope
Is by trying to hold onto hope
If just for a while
If just for a while

I wanna know the measure
From here to forever
And I wanna feel the pressure
Of God or whatever
Now it seems more than ever
There's no hands on the levers
And I wanna feel the pressure
Of God or whatever

Only rollers keep rolling
While the searchers keep scrolling

I wanna know the measure
From here to forever
And I wanna feel the pressure
Of God or whatever
Now it seems more than ever
There's no hands on the levers
And I wanna feel the pressure
Of God or whatever

Or whatever

LYRICS
Smoke has turned to ashes
No fire from the flame
Now we stand here wondering
Which one is to blame
Time

Years have turned to memories
Future’s now the past
Who turned it all upside down
Flipped the hourglass 

Time
Tell me who made time
Time
Tell me who made time

I know I don’t know everything 
But I know what I don’t know
One thing that I know for sure
Is I can never let her go
So tell me who made time

Tell me that she’s mine 
Till the sun no longer shines
Forever will be fine
Tell me who made time

If I could ask for one last prayer
And the maker would be so kind
I’d beg steal or borrow
For just a little more of that precious time

So tell me who made time
Tell me that she’s mine
Till the sun no longer shines
Forever will be fine
Tell me who made time
Tell me who made time

Lyrics:

Oh yeah
Candles burnin' low
Lot's of mistletoe.
Lot's of snow and ice,
Eveywhere we go
Choirs singin' carols,
Right outside my door

All these things and more
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)

Yeah, yeah
I see your smilin' face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love ya madly
It seems I love you more
And little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure

All these things and more, darling
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)

I feel like runnin' wild
As angels and a little child
Greet you ‘neath the mistletoe toe
Kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas baby
(Wish you a Merry Christmas baby)
And such happiness in the comin' year
Happiness in the comin' year

Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet Silent Night
Fill a sheet with the angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
We'll go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

All these things and more, baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)
Oh!
All these things and more, baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)

Oh!
All these things and more, baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means, Christmas means to me
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)
My baby that's what Christmas means to me
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)

Oh baby, all these things and more
Oh baby, that's what Christmas means
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)

About Teen Titans Go!:
TEEN TITANS GO! features the return of Robin, Starfire, Raven, Beast Boy and Cyborg in all-new comedic adventures. Character-driven comedy is the order of the day as this new iteration focuses on the funny that happens in between saving the world and living together as teenagers without adult supervision. After all, these teens may be super heroes, but somebody still has to do the laundry -- even if they use their super powers to do it! They'll also need to take Driver's Ed to get a license ... especially when someone has wrecked the Batmobile taking it for an unauthorized joy ride to impress a girl. Pranks take on a whole new level for these titans when they can turn into any animal or detach their robotic limbs. Featuring the principal voice cast from the original series, TEEN TITANS GO! captures everything audiences loved about the original show, while cranking up the comedy and laughing at the lighter side of being a super hero.

Lyrics:

He's gone
2000 miles
Is very far
The snows falling down
It's colder day by day
I miss you

The children were singing
He'll be back at Christmas time
And these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream
You appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow
Sparkle
Our hearts was singing
It felt like Christmas time

2000 miles
Is very far through the snow
I'll think of you
Wherever you go

He's gone
2000 miles
Is very far
The snows falling down
It's colder day by day
I miss you
I can hear people singing
It must be Christmas time
I hear people singing
It must be Christmas time

Official music video for 'Brass in Pocket' by The Pretenders. It was written by Chrissie Hynde and James Honeyman-Scott, and produced by Chris Thomas, released in 1979. It features on the debut album ‘Pretenders’, released on 7 January, 1980.

The band's third single was scored number one on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in January 1980 (making it the first new number-one single of the 1980s) and number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States.

Hynde got the idea for the song's title when, during an after-show dinner, she overheard someone enquiring if anyone had, ""Picked up dry cleaning? Any brass in pocket?""

Got brass in pocket
Got bottle I'm gonna use it
Intention I feel inventive
Gonna make you, make you, make you notice

Got motion restrained emotion
Been driving Detroit leaning
No reason just seems so pleasing
Gonna make you, make you, make you notice

Gonna use my arms
Gonna use my legs
Gonna use my style
Gonna use my sidestep
Gonna use my fingers
Gonna use my, my, my imagination

'Cause I gonna make you see
There's nobody else here
No one like me
I'm special, so special
I gotta have some of your attention give it to me

Got rhythm I can't miss a beat
Got new skank it's so reet
Got something I'm winking at you
Gonna make you, make you, make you notice

Gonna use my arms

Lyrics: 

I found a picture of you, oh oh oh oh
What hijacked my world that night
To a place in the past
We've been cast out of? oh oh oh oh
Now we're back in the fight
We're back on the train
Oh, back on the chain gang

A circumstance beyond our control, oh oh oh oh
The phone, the tv and the news of the world
Got in the house like a pigeon from hell, oh oh oh oh
Threw sand in our eyes and descended like flies
Put us back on the train
Oh, back on the chain gang

The powers that be
That force us to live like we do
Bring me to my knees
When I see what they've done to you
But I'll die as I stand here today
Knowing that deep in my heart
They'll fall to ruin one day
For making us part

I found a picture of you, oh oh oh oh
Those were the happiest days of my life
Like a break in the battle was your part, oh oh oh oh
In the wretched life of a lonely heart
Now we're back on the train
Oh, back on the chain gang

Lyrics: 

Don't get me wrong
If I'm looking kind of dazzled
I see neon lights
Whenever you walk by

Don't get me wrong
If you say hello and I take a ride
Upon a sea where the mystic moon
Is playing havoc with the tide
Don't get me wrong

Don't get me wrong
If I'm acting so distracted
I'm thinking about the fireworks
That go off when you smile

Don't get me wrong
If I split like light refracted
I'm only off to wander
Across a moonlit mile

Once in awhile
Two people meet
Seemingly for no reason
They just pass on the street
Suddenly thunder, showers everywhere
Who can explain the thunder and rain
But there's something in the air

Don't get me wrong
If I come and go like fashion
I might be great tomorrow
But hopeless yesterday

Don't get me wrong
If I fall in the 'mode of passion'
It might be unbelievable
But let's not say so long
It might just be fantastic
Don't get me wrong

Lyrics:

Let me inside you
Into your room
I've heard it's lined with the things you don't show
Lay me beside you
Down on the floor
I've been your lover
From the womb to the tomb
I dress as your daughter
When the moon becomes round
You be my mother
When everything's gone

And she will always carry on
Something is lost
But something is found
They will keep on speaking her name
Some things change
Some stay the same

Keep beckoning to me
From behind that closed door
The maid and the mother
And the crone that's grown old

I hear your voice
Coming out of that hole
I listen to you
And I want some more
I listen to you
And I want some more

And she will always carry on
Something is lost
But something is found
They will keep on speaking her name
Some things change
Some stay the same",False,False,30855489.0,rock music

Lyrics:

I never really had a problem because of leaving 
But everything reminds me of her this evening 

So if I seem a little out of it, sorry 
But why should I lie? 
Everything reminds me of her 

The spin of the earth impaled a silhouette of the sun on the steeple 
And I got to hear the same sermon all the time now from you people 
Why are you staring into outer space, crying? 
Just because you came across it, and lost it 

Everything reminds me of her 
Everything reminds me of her 
Everything reminds me of her",False,True,8136528.0,indie pop

Having left Genesis the previous summer, Peter’s first solo album arrived in February 1977. He was 26. With legendary producer Bob Ezrin taking charge the intention was to make something more direct and tougher than what had come before. Solsbury Hill was the first single to be taken from the album, though the video you see here was created much later ""just messing around at Real World with a painter friend of mine Graham Dean."" says Peter.

Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing stretching every nerve
Had to listen, had no choice

I did not believe the information
I just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom boom boom
""Son,"" he said
""Grab your things, I've come to take you home""

To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
'Til I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut

I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey,"" he said
""Grab your things, I've come to take you home""
back home

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me

Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey"" I said
""You can keep my things, they've come to take me home""

Climbing up on Solsbury Hill

Directed by Stephen R. Johnson, produced by Adam Whittaker. Claymation, pixilation, and stop motion animation provided by Aardman Animations and the Brothers Quay.

Sledgehammer was the first single from the multi-platinum selling album So, the first of Peter’s studio albums to have a proper title and a watershed release in his career. Its marriage of the artistic and the commercial made for an indisputable success, with the album quickly sitting atop the album charts on both sides of the Atlantic.

You could have a steam train
If you'd just lay down your tracks
You could have an aeroplane flying
If you bring your blue sky back
All you do is call me
I'll be anything you need

You could have a big dipper
Going up and down, all around the bends
You could have a bumper car, bumping
This amusement never ends

I want to be - your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name
Oh  let me be your sledgehammer
This will be my testimony

Show me round your fruitcage
'Cos I will be your honey bee
Open up your fruitcage
Where the fruit is as sweet as can be

I want to be - your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name
You'd better call the sledgehammer
Put your mind at rest
I'm going to be - the sledgehammer
This can be my testimony
I'm your sledgehammer
Let there be no doubt about it

Sledge Sledge Sledgehammer

I've kicked the habit, shed my skin
This is the new stuff, I go dancing in, we go dancing in

Oh won't you show for me and I will show for you
Show for me, I will show for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do mean you, only you
You've been coming through
Going to build that power
Build, build up that power, hey
I've been feeding the rhythm
I've been feeding the rhythm
Going to feel that power build in you

Come on, come on, help me do
Come on, come on, help me do
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh , yeh, yeh, you
I've been feeding the rhythm
I've been feeding the rhythm
It's what we're doing, doing

A standout track from Peter's fifth studio album and the first one  to have a proper title: So was a watershed release in his career. Its marriage of the artistic and the commercial made for an indisputable success, with the album quickly sitting atop the album charts on both sides of the Atlantic. 

Aside from some intriguing collaborations – with Laurie Anderson on This Is The Picture, Kate Bush on Don’t Give Up and Youssou N’Dour on In Your Eyes – it was the unity of singer, band and producer that made So such a crucial record in the Gabriel canon.

In this proud land we grew up strong
We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never thought I could fail

No fight left or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
But no-one wants you when you lose

Don't give up 'cause you have friends
Don't give up you're not beaten yet
Don't give up I know you can make it good

Though I saw it all around
Never thought that I could be affected
Thought that we'd be last to go
It is so strange the way things turn
Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born,  on the lakeside
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground

Don't give up you still have us
Don't give up we don't need much of anything
Don't give up  'cause somewhere there's a place where we belong

Rest your head
You worry too much
It's going to be alright
When times get rough
You can fall back on us
Don't give up
Please don't give up

Got to walk out of here
I can't take anymore
Going to stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come
and whatever may go
That river's flowing
That river's flowing


Moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down
For every job, so many men
So many men no-one needs

Don't give up 'cause you have friends
Don't give up you're not the only one
Don't give up no reason to be ashamed
Don't give up you still have us
Don't give up now we're proud of who you are
Don't give up you know it's never been easy
Don't give up 'cause I believe there's a place
There's a place 
Where we belong


Don't give up
Don't give up
Don't give up

Peter's orchestral version of the David Bowie / Brian Eno classic ‘Heroes'. Produced by Peter with Bob Ezrin and arranged by John Metcalfe.

The track is taken from Peter's eighth studio album 'Scratch My Back', the first part of Peter’s song-swap project. Originally conceived as a reciprocal arrangement that would be released as one album it was Peter’s half that arrived first, in 2010, featuring his orchestral interpretations of some of his favourite songs. 

The second part, featuring artists covering Peter’s songs was aptly named 'And I’ll Scratch Yours' and followed in 2013.

A top 5 single in the UK, Games Without Frontiers is taken from Peter's third self titled solo album. Recorded both at his home studio at Ashcombe House, near Bath, and at London’s Townhouse Studios, the album was produced by Steve Lillywhite. 

The album saw Peter change his writing style; now the rhythm came before the melody and the songs were built up on top of the rhythmic sequences. The album also contains Peter’s first overtly political song in the shape of totemic closer Biko. It also features notable contributions from Kate Bush, Paul Weller, Phil Collins and David Rhodes.

Lemme think for a second. (well? )
Oh, he gets butt naked.
And then he walks through the street winkin at freaks,
Wit a two-liter stuck in his butt-cheeks!
What is a juggalo? 
He just dont care.
He might try to put a weave in his nut hair.
Cuz he could give a fuck less what a bitch thinks,
He tell her that her butt stinks, and all that,
What is a juggalo? 
He drinks like a fish,
And then he starts huggin people like a drunk bitch,
Next thing hes pickin fights with his best friends,
Then he starts with the huggin again, fuck,
What is a juggalo? 
A fuckin lunatic.
Somebody with a rope tied to his dick,
Then he jumps out a ten-story windowéééoh!

What the fuck? connec-man, that shits wack.
Dont worry bout my shit, just rap, mutha fucker.
What is a juggalo? 
He aint a bitch boy.
Hell walk through to the hills and beat down a rich boy.
Walks right in the house where ya havin supper,
And dip his nuts in ya soupéébloop!
What is a juggalo? 
Well he aint a phoney.
Hell walk up and bust a nut in your macaroni.
And watch you sit there and finish up the last bit,
Cuz youre a stupid-ass dumb fuckin idiot.
What is a juggalo? 
Hes a graduate.
He graduated from......well,
At least hes got a job, hes not a dumb putz,
He works for himself scratchin his nuts, ha!

Lyrics:

You should've seen by the look in my eyes, baby
There was somethin missin
You should've known by the tone of my voice, maybe
But you didn't listen
You played dead
But you never bled
Instead you lay still in the grass
All coiled up and hissin
And though I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
Cause it was us baby, way before then
And we're still together
And I meant, every word I said
When I said that I love you I meant
That I love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on lovin you
Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on lovin you",True,True,245359052.0,rock music

Lyrics:

Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from another you been messin' around
They say you got a boy friend
You're out late every weekend
They're talkin' about you and it's bringin' me down
But I know the neighborhood
And talk is cheap when the story is good
And the tales grow taller on down the line
But I'm telling you, babe
That I don't think it's true, babe
And even if it is keep this in mind

You take it on the run baby
If that's the way you want it baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun so you take it on the run",True,True,124062861.0,rock music

Lyrics:
I've been around for you
I've been up and down for you
But I just can't get any relief
I've swallowed my pride for you
I've lived and lied for you
But you still make me feel like a thief
You got me stealin' your love away

And you make me cry

Lyrics:

When light goes down, I see no reason
For you to cry. We've been through this before
In every time, in every season,
God knows I've tried
So please don't ask for more.

Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye

Carrie, Carrie, things they change my friend
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet again

I read your mind, with no intentions
Of being unkind, I wish I could explain
It all takes time, a whole lot of patience
If it's a crime, how come I feel no pain.",True,True,187138187.0,speed metal

Lyrics:

I've gone through changes
I've gone through pain
But there's not enough reason for me to go insane
I know the feeling, when it grows
I'm in a rage up from my head down to my toes.

You know it ain't easy
Running out of thrills
You know it ain't easy
When you don't know what you want.

Rock now, rock the night
'Til early in the morning light
Rock now, rock the night
You'd better believe it's right.",True,True,69854845.0,speed metal

Lyrics:

Days filled with joy and days filled with sorrow
I don't know just what to do
Am I happy today, am I lonely tomorrow
Everything depends on you

I've been waiting for the angels to knock on my door
I've been hopin' that everything could be like before

Open your heart and tell me what's wrong
Why can't you talk like you used to do before
I don't know if I'm weak, I don't know if I'm strong
Hey girl, I can't cope anymore

I've been waiting...

Open your heart, let me hear you 
Make up your mind, I want to hear you call 
Open your heart, want to come near you 
Make up your mind, before we lose it all",True,True,21873764.0,speed metal

Lyrics:

Keep on walkin' that road and I'll follow
Keep on callin' my name I'll be there
And if a mirror should break it's easy to take
Cause deep down I know that you care
I'm not superstitious

I'm not superstitious, I have no doubt
That there's a reason, how things turn out
While things are changin' from day to day
I'll keep this feelin' with me all the way

Lyrics:
They lived in peace, not long ago
A mighty Indian tribe
But the winds of change,
Made them realize, that the promises were lies.
The white man's greed, in search of gold
Made the nation bleed
They lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn.
Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears.
They were driven hard, across the plains
And walked for many moons
Cause the winds of change,
Had made them realize, that the promises were lies.
So much to bear, all that pain
Left them in despair
They lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn.

Lyrics:

I never dreamed that
I could fall
But something's come
Over me
Now I'm sittin' starin'
At the wall
Afraid for my sanity

I wanna give you my heart
Give you my soul
I wanna lay in your arms
Never let go
Don't wanna live my
Life without you
But I know when you're gone
Like a fire needs a spark
Like a fool in the dark
I'll cry for you",True,True,6740404.0,speed metal

Lyrics:
I don't know where I'm going
But I sure know where I've been
Hanging on the promises
In songs of yesterday

And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

Here I go again
Here I go again

Though I keep searching for an answer
I never seem to find what I'm looking for
Oh, Lord, I pray
You give me strength to carry on

'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

Here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone

But I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

Just another heart in need of rescue
Waiting on love's sweet charity
And I am gonna hold on
For the rest of my days

'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

Here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

But here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go

'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

Here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

Here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

Here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
