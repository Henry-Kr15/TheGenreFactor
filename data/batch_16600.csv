Lyrics

We open with the vultures, kissing the cannibals
Sure I get lonely, when I'm the only
Only human in the heaving heat of the animals
Bit of brown salt, stinging on my tongue and I

I will not waver, I will not wait its turn
It will beat, it will burn, burn, burn your love into the ground
With the lips of another
'Til you get lonely, sure I get lonely, sometimes

All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man I drink too much
Another Friday night I wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to you babe

I hate the bar
Pharmacy addict hit a Wall Street traffic, took the car
We reinvent the wheel just to fall asleep at it, skrrr
Crash on the floor, catch the ZZZ's
Poppin' the polar opposite, the NZT
Hip hop and the propaganda say they name brand
But I done seen how the - did my main man

The nights we won't remember
Are the nights we won't remember
I'll be gone 'til November
All my city calls me Simba
Dreams are made for cages nigga
Lions are for real nigga
Dying is for real, niggas dying off of pills nigga

Friday's are for chill and I escaped the treachery
I just had to rest in peace the recipe
The rest of us are praying that the sand will leave a tan
If you're up right now, hope you hear what I'm saying
Hope you hear what I'm saying

All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man I drink too much
Another Friday night I wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to you babe

Don't even know me
Sure I get lonely some nights
When the angels on my shoulder
Slump my head
I'm stuck here with the vultures
Hissing and circling
You didn't call me, call me, call me, call me
I'm crawling, crawling, crawling back to you

All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man I drink too much
Another Friday night I wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to you babe

All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man I drink too much
Another Friday night I wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to you babe",True,True,562271765.0,alternative R&B

Lyrics: 
 
I can hear your body talk
Every word you’re saying
Your silhouette on the wall
I think I like the game you’re playing
You’re something irresistible
Every move you’re making
Your lips so kissable
 
Rhythm got my heart saying
 
Ooh la la 
Show me how you do the things you do la la
It blows my mind.
Watching you la la
Burning but you’re ice cold
you’re so scandalous, scandalous ah yeah
 
Mirrors on the ceiling
Magic make believing 
Joyriding the feeling 
Ooh na na na na
Can’t nobody see us
Things we do between us
We can keep a secret 
 
Got my heart saying
 
Ooh la la 
Show me how you do the things you do la la
It blows my mind
Watching you la la
Burning but you’re ice cold
you’re so scandalous, scandalous ah 
 
I can hear your body talk
Every word you’re saying
Your silhouette on the wall
I think I like the game you’re playing
You’re something irresistible
Every move you’re making
Your lips so kissable
 
Rhythm got my heart saying
 
Ooh la la 
Show me how you do the things you do la la
It blows my mind
Watching you la la
Burning but you’re ice cold
you’re so scandalous, scandalous ah yeah

Lyrics: 

2X
No fue culpa tuya 
ni tampoco mía 
fue culpa de la monotonía 
nunca dije nada pero me dolía 
yo sabía que esto pasaría 

Tu en lo tuyo y haciendo lo mismo 
siempre buscando protagonismo 
te olvidaste de lo que un dia fuimos
y lo peor es que 

No fue culpa tuya 
ni tampoco mía 
fue culpa de la monotonía 
nunca dije nada pero me dolía 
yo sabía que esto pasaría 

De repente no eras el mismo
me dejaste por tu narcisismo 
te olvidaste de lo que un día fuimos 

Tu distante con tu actitud 
y eso me llenaba de inquietud 
tú no daba ni la mitad 
pero sí sé que di más que tú 
estaba corriendo por alguien       
que por mí ni estaba caminando 

Este amor no muerto pero esta delirando
ya de lo que había ya no hay na
te lo digo con sinceridad 
tu estas frío como en Navidad 
es mejor que esto se acabe ya 
no me repita la movie otra vez que esa ya la vi 

Bebe yo te quiero pero es que yo me quiero más a mí 
es un adios necesario 
lo que un día fue increíble se volvió rutinario
no me saben a nada tus labios 
ahora es todo lo contrario 
y lo peor es que

No fue culpa tuya 
ni tampoco mía 
fue culpa de la monotonía 
nunca dije nada pero me dolía 
yo sabía que esto pasaría 

Tu en lo tuyo y haciendo lo mismo 
siempre buscando protagonismo
te olvidaste de lo que un día fuimos (ambos)
eh eh eh (ambos)

Letra / Lyrics

De tanto que regué una flor se murió
Y baby aprendí que… (baby aprendí que)
A veces darlo todo pa’ que algo funcione
puede que perjudique (puede que perjudique)
te juro yo vi que
te estaba dando más
en ti se me iba el día
Y mientras tú matabas esto
yo le daba vida
abrí los ojos y puse todo en la balanza
y la verdad que de remar solo se cansa

Lo siento pero CHAO BEBÉ,
Me duele pero CHAO BEBÉ
con o sin ti sigue la vida
Adiós, te me cuidas
no voy a estar rezando por ti
mi Dios la cuide 
pero CHAO BEBÉ,
Me duele pero CHAO BEÉ
con o sin ti sigue la vida
Adiós te me cuidas
no voy a estar rezando por ti
mi Dios la cuide siempre

Ojos azules 
maldito el día en que te tuve
fue tu veneno que no sale de mi, estoy inmune
ay, borré las fotos en Dubai
y deja de estar llamándome desde el celu de tu mai
Estás leía te pasa por ser hijue puta
ahora me toca yo ando en la mía
No envíes Dm con videos y canciones de Sia
que ya no te creo - eo
estoy en jangueo botella de tequila, y en el fumeteo-eo
si es pa yo verte, en la disco me quedo
Hoy otra guía la Merce' 
ahora ando sin perse'
como los tiempos cambiaron
tu amiga escribe pa verme
pero tranquila que yo estoy pa otra, no estoy pa ella 
pon la querella que no se acabe la botella 

Lo siento pero CHAO BEBÉ
Me duele pero CHAO BEBÉ
con o sin ti sigue la vida
Adiós te me cuidas
no voy a estar rezando por ti
mi Dios la cuide 
pero CHAO BEBÉ,
Me duele pero CHAO BEBÉ
con o sin ti sigue la vida
Adiós te me cuidas
no voy a estar rezando por ti

y vas a estar bien sin mi
yo también lo estaré
qué harás con tu vida, no te preguntaré
pero ojalá que na’ te falte
hoy nuestros caminos se parten
y vas a estar bien sin mi
yo también lo estaré
qué harás con tu vida no te preguntare
pero ojalá que na te falte
hoy nuestros caminos se parten
O O Ovy On The Drums
con o sin ti sigue la vida
no voy a estar rezando por ti
Chao bebé.

LYRICS:

Han pasado varios días y estoy enfermo de ti
Dime que me hiciste mal
De mi memoria yo no te puedo borrar
Dios me va a castigar le prometí te iba a olvidar

No hay porque seguir mintiendo 
El tiempo eta’ corriendo y no se puede parar (no se puede parar)
La soledad me sigue consumiendo 
Mas te estoy extrañando no lo puedo negar 

Bebe yo soy adicto a tu piel 
Siempre vuelvo a caer aunque quiera romper
Este vicio de ti que me hace mal y a veces me hace bien
Dime que vas hacer e’-e’ estoy puesto pa’ ti si no quieres de mi yo no voy aparecer e’
Yo trato de explicarte y tu no quieres entender e’

Bebe yo soy adicto a tu piel 
Siempre vuelvo a caer aunque quiera romper (romper)
Este vicio de ti que me hace mal y ay veces me hace bien
Dime que vas hacer e’-er’ estoy puesto pa’ ti si no quieres de mi yo no voy aparece e’-er’
Yo trato de explicarte y tu no quieres entender e’-e’ (mamasita)

Toy adicto no te dejo en visto 
Mamita rica cuando te desvisto 
Un usuario yo te necesito 
Lo que yo hago contigo ya es instinto
Tengo otro amanecer e’-e’
Viendo la noche desaparecer e’-e’
Y yo no se si tu eres infiel pero contigo quiero hacer 
lo que hicimos aquella vez e’-e’

Yo trato de explicarte y tu no quieres entender e’-e’ (ozuna)

Soy adicto a tu parte 
Me siento un brujo que no puedo olvidarte (olvidarte)
Cada vez que te veo difícil de esquivarte (Oh’-Oh’)
Y después te toy llamando con ganas de darte 
Y es que (bebe)

Letra: 
Woah oh 
El negrito ojos claros
Llevo tiempo diciéndoselo, que algo mejor se merece
Perdiendo su tiempo sigue, sabiendo que no me pertenece

Y desde que la conocí se va con su amiga pa la disco
Pero cuando le sube la nota, siempre vuelve a mi 
Me dice vida mía yo se que tengo que dejar que tú hagas tus locuras

Tú mi locura baby pasan las horas y más me pide más
No se cansa parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura

Tú mi locura baby pasan las horas y más me pide más
No se cansa parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura

Una locura, me encanta cuando lo hacemos en la Acura
Antes de llegar con la foto me tortura
Se vuelve loca si le aprieto la cintura
Ella es mi baby, se pasa to’a la noche apretaita conmigo 
Nadie sospecha porque ni por las redes la sigo
Solo somos amigos 
Como Piqué y Shakira 
Yo en mi cama la cuido, mi baby 
Se pasa to’a la noche apretaita conmigo 
Nadie sospecha porque ni por las redes la sigo
Solo somos amigos 
Como Piqué y Shakira 
Yo en mi cama la cuido, mi baby 

Tú mi locura baby pasan las horas y más me pide más
No se cansa parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura

Tú mi locura baby pasan las horas y más me pide más
No se cansa parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura

Siempre que escucho una canción que me recuerda a ti
O una foto tuya atrevida que me llega a mi
Me activa el deseo, de ti me dan ganas
Y te llamo porque se que nunca hay trabas
Tú misma me dices que lo nuestro es eternity 
Porque ella es boyante no hace falta tu fatality 
En el 5 letras soy quien te penetra
Corleone cuando te lo hace high quality 
Te pones insanity porque soy tu debility
En privacidad lo que tenemos es un reality 
Hace con tu vida lo que quiera y yo lo permití
Pero tú me llama o yo te llamo y le caemos ahí 

Dime cual es el propósito que vea tus videos
Como esta el esposito me tienes bien loquito 
No entiendo cual es el problema, 
Si nos gustamos tanto cual es el dilema
Estoy tentado a tocarte, tentado a pecar
Por mi te secuestro y de aquí no te vas
Pero si vuelve a mi
Me dice vida mía yo se que tengo que dejar que tu hagas tus locuras  
Tentado a tocarte, tentado a pecar
Por mi te secuestro y de aquí no te vas
Pero si vuelve a mi
Me dice vida mía yo se que tengo que dejar que tu hagas tus locuras  

Tú mi locura baby pasan las horas y más me pide más
No se cansa parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura

Tú mi locura baby pasan las horas y más me pide más
No se cansa parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura

Lyrics: 
Don’t remind me 
I’m minding my own damn business 
Don’t try to find me 
I’m better left alone than in this
It doesn’t surprise me 
Do you really think that I could care 
If you really don’t like me
Find somebody else
It could be anyone else out there
 
Don’t fret 
I don’t ever want to see you
And I never want to meet you again
One thing
When you’re angry you’re a jerk 
And then you treat me like I’m worth nothing 
Don’t fret 
I don’t ever want to see you 
And I never want to meet you again
It’ll happen again
I watch it happen over and over again

Don’t fret 
I don’t ever want to see you 
And I never want to meet you again
One thing
When you’re angry you’re a jerk 
And then you treat me like I’m worth nothing 

Don’t remind me 
I’m minding my own damn business 
Don’t try to find me 
I’m better left alone than in this
It doesn’t surprise me 
Do you really think that I could care 
If you really don’t like me
Find somebody else
 
Don’t fret 
I don’t ever want to see you
And I never want to meet you again
One thing
When you’re angry you’re a jerk 
And then you treat me like I’m worth nothing 
Don’t fret 
I don’t ever want to see you 
And I never want to meet you again
It’ll happen again
I watch it happen over and over again

Don’t fret 
I don’t ever want to see you 
And I never want to meet you again
One thing
When you’re angry you’re a jerk 
And then you treat me like I’m worth nothing

English Lyrics: 
Babe you’re too controlling 
Ima feed you to the wolves 
When you get nasty 
Back at me 
But baby don’t distract me I’m a goner 

I lost her 
Like why the hell you wanna 
Play me that way 
You’re bad babe 
You double faced entendre 

Life goes  
On and on and on and on and 
on and on and on and on 
On and on and on and on and 
on and on and on and on 
On and on and on and on and 
on and on and on and on 
On and on and on and on and 
on and on and on and on 

Babe you best believe it 
Ima rip you up to pieces 
I’m a lover, not a ﬁghter 
But I’ll light this place on ﬁre 

I want it 
I’m on it 
But babe at least I’m honest
I get tired of explaining  
As these seasons keep on changing 

Life goes  
On and on and on and on and 
on and on and on and on 
(Yeah yeah yeah) 
On and on and on and on and 
on and on and on and on

Work all day 
And then I wake up 
Work all day 
And then I wake up 
Work all day 
And then I wake up 
Work all day

Work all day 
And then I wake up 
Work all day 
And then I wake up 
Work all day 
And then I wake up

Spanish Lyrics:
Cariño eres demasiado controladora, 
Te daré de comer a los lobos, 
Cuando te pongas grosera, 
Conmigo, 
Pero cariño, no me distraigas, 
Estoy perdido, 
La perdí, 
Como porqué diablo quieres, 
Jugar conmigo de esa manera, 
Eres mala, nena
Tú, con tus dobles sentidos       

La vida 
Sigue y sigue y sigue y sigue y
Sigue y sigue y sigue y sigue 
Sigue y sigue y sigue y sigue y
Sigue y sigue y sigue y sigue 
Sigue y sigue y sigue y sigue y
Sigue y sigue y sigue y sigue 
Sigue y sigue y sigue y sigue y
Sigue y sigue y sigue y sigue 
Cariño, lo debes de creer, 
Te haré pedazos, 
Soy un amante, no un luchador, 
Pero prenderé fuego a este lugar, 
Lo quiero, 
Estoy en eso, 
Pero nena, al menos soy honesto, 
Me canso de explicar 
En que estas estaciones siguen cambiando, 
La vida 
Sigue y sigue y sigue y sigue y
Sigue y sigue y sigue y sigue
(Yeah yeah yeah) 
Sigue y sigue y sigue y sigue y
Sigue y sigue y sigue y sigue
(Yeah yeah yeah) 
Sigue y sigue y sigue y sigue y
Sigue y sigue y sigue y sigue
(Yeah yeah yeah) 
Sigue y sigue y sigue y sigue y
Sigue y sigue y sigue y sigue
(Yeah yeah yeah) 
Trabajo todo el día 
Y luego me despierto
Trabajo todo el día 
Y luego me despierto
Trabajo todo el día 
Y luego me despierto
Trabajo todo el día 
(Yeah yeah yeah)

Trabajo todo el día 
Y luego me despierto
Trabajo todo el día 
Y luego me despierto
Trabajo todo el día

Lyrics: 
Don’t remind me 
I’m minding my own damn business 
Don’t try to find me 
I’m better left alone than in this
It doesn’t surprise me 
Do you really think that I could care 
If you really don’t like me
Find somebody else
It could be anyone else out there

Don’t fret 
I don’t ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you’re angry you’re a jerk 
And then you treat me like I’m worth nothing 
Don’t fret 
I don’t ever want to see you 
And I never want to meet you again
It’ll happen again
I watch it happen over and over again 

I watch the walls caving in on me 
I’m sick of feeling so f*cking lonely
By now I’ve given up all hope 
I guess I’m better off alone

Don’t fret 
I don’t ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you’re angry you’re a jerk 
And then you treat me like I’m worth nothing 
Don’t fret 
I don’t ever wanna see you 
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you’re angry you’re a jerk 
And then you treat me like I’m worth nothing 
Don’t fret 
I don’t ever want see you 
And I never want meet you again

It’ll happen again
I watch it happen over and over again 

Don’t remind me 
I’m minding my own damn business 
Don’t try to find me 
I’m better left alone than in this
It doesn’t surprise me 
Do you really think that I could care 
If you really don’t like me
Find somebody else
It could be anyone else out there

Don’t fret 
I don’t ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you’re angry you’re a jerk 
And then you treat me like I’m worth nothing 
Don’t fret 
I don’t ever want to see you 
And I never want to meet you again

It’ll happen again
I watch it happen over and over again

Lyrics:

Hay un rayo de luz 
Que entró por mi ventana 
Y me ha devuelto las ganas, 
Me quita el dolor
Tu amor es uno de esos, 
Que te cambian con un beso 
Y te pone a volar
 
Mi pedazo de sol, 
La niña de mis ojos 
Tiene una colección 
De corazones rotos, 
Mi pedazo de sol, 
La niña de mis ojos, 
La que baila reggaetón 
Con tacones rojos y me pone a volar, 
La que me hace llorar, 
La que me hace sufrir, 
Pero no paro de amar
Porque me hizo sentir, 
Que gane la lotería 
Antes de ella no sabía
Que alguien podía amarme así
 
Desde que te conocí, lo sentí, me deje llevar, 
Me morí, reviví en el mismo bar, 
Solo entraba para emborracharme, 
Ey, 
No esperaba enamorarme de ti, 
Ni tú de mí, 
Pasó así, 
Y así empezó nuestra historia, 
No falla mi memoria, 
Yo te dije baby 
¿qué haces tú por aquí?, 
Así empezó nuestra historia 
Y te lleve pa´ Colombia

Mi pedazo de sol, 
La niña de mis ojos 
Tiene una colección 
De corazones rotos, 
Mi pedazo de sol, 
La niña de mis ojos, 
La que baila reggaetón 
Con tacones rojos y me pone a volar, 
La que me hace llorar, 
La que me hace sufrir, 
Pero no paro de amar
Porque me hizo sentir, 
Que gane la lotería 
Antes de ella no sabía
Que alguien podía amarme así
 
Mi pedazo de sol, 
La niña de mis ojos 
Tiene una colección 
De corazones rotos, 
Mi pedazo de sol, 
La niña de mis ojos, 
La que baila reggaetón 
Con tacones rojos y me pone a volar, 
La que me hace llorar, 
La que me hace sufrir, 
Pero no paro de amar
Porque me hizo sentir, 
Que gane la lotería 
Antes de ella no sabía
Que alguien podía amarme así

Lyrics:
Uooo, Uooo, mmm,
Que tan loco sería si yo fuera el dueño de tu corazón por solo un día,
Si nos gana la alegría, yo por fin te besaría,
¿Qué pasaría?, podrías ver entre él y yo quien ganaría,
Mi condición, enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño,
Y el no tenerte me hace daño,
Seríamos la pareja del año, cuanto te extraño,
Sin condición, me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía,
Y mis amigos lo sabían,
Y a mí todo el mundo me decía, que pasaría, me dejarías,
Si me dieran solo 24 horas yo la aprovecho,
Juro que yo voy a hacerte cosas que nunca te han hecho
Ya yo me cansé de ser amigo con derechos, yo tal vez no te merezco 
Pero no hay ni que decirlo, si nos juntamos seríamos la pareja del siglo 
Ponme ya a capella me da con introducirlo, navaja doble filo,
Cortamos y los videos me dio con reproducirlo 
Me lo decían, yo los ignoraba
Simplemente todo, ahora quedó en la nada
Se lo hacía allá, los ojos la miraban, 
Yo nunca creía que el amor cegaba 
Mi condición, enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño,
Y no tenerte me hace daño,
Seríamos la pareja del año, cuanto te extraño,
Sin condición, me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía,
Y mis amigos lo sabían,
Y a mí todo el mundo me decía, que pasaría, me dejarías,
Es a mí, mi depresión, de ver una foto tuya y verte en la televisión,
Puede ser que me destruya la mente, detente,
Como dice la canción que no meten preso a nadie por robarse un corazón,
Sufriendo y llorando de pena,
Que no, ya mi llanto no vale la pena, 
Yo no tengo alas, pero tu si vuelas, 
Se vuelve la mala de nuestra novela,
Me tienes sufriendo y llorando de pena, 
Que no, ya mi llanto no vale la pena, 
Yo no tengo alas, pero tu si vuelas, 
Me quitas la pista y me quedo a capella,
Mi condición, enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño,
Y el no tenerte me hace daño,
Seríamos la pareja del año, cuanto te extraño,
Sin condición, me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía,
Y mis amigos lo sabían,
Y a mí todo el mundo me decía, que pasaría, me dejarías,
Yo tenía otra melodía, de lo que resultaría,
Maldita monotonía, fue culpa tuya? ¿O fue culpa mía?,
Yo aprendí a vivir con celos, tu aprendiste a no ser mía,
Solo queda ser sincero, yo te quiero todavía.

Lyrics:
Recuerdo aquel día
Como si fuera hoy
No hay nada como ella
Y siquiera me encontró
Recuerdo todavía
La vez que la besé
Fue mi primer amor
Y ahora escribo su canción
Hay algo más
Inexplicable como su mirada
Inigualable como la manera en que me cela
Y trata de disimular que no está mal
Voy a cuidarte por las noches
Voy a amarte sin reproches
Te voy a extrañar en la tempestad
Y aunque existan mil razones para renunciar
No hay nadie más
No hay nadie más
Se llevó todo, se llevó tristeza
Ya no existe espacio en la melancolía
Porque, a su lado, todo tiene más razón
Me llevé sus lágrimas, llegaron risas
Cuando estamos juntos, la Tierra se paraliza
Se paraliza
Hay algo más
Inexplicable como su mirada
Inigualable como la manera en que me cela
Y trata de disimular que no está mal
Voy a cuidarte por las noches
Voy a amarte sin reproches
Te voy a extrañar en la tempestad
Y aunque existan mil razones para renunciar
Voy a cuidarte por las noches
Voy a amarte sin reproches
Te voy a extrañar en la soledad
Y aunque existan mil razones para terminar
No hay nadie más
No hay nadie más
No quiero a nadie más
Ooh, no hay nadie más
No hay nadie

Lyrics:
Yo te conocí en primavera
Me miraste tú de primera
De un verano eterno me enamoré
Y esa despedida en septiembre
En octubre sí que se siente
Noviembre sin ti me dolió también
Llegará diciembre, sigues en mi mente
Fueron seis meses y por fin volveré a verte
Llegará febrero yo seré el primero
En darte flores y decirte que te quiero
Puede que pase un año más de una vez
Sin que te pueda ver
Pero el amor es más fuerte
Puede que el tiempo nos aleje otra vez
Sin saber dónde estés
Pero el amor es más fuerte
Ooooh oh oh oh oh
Te esperaré porque el amor es más fuerte
Ya le dije a mis amigos yo no necesito nada y solo tú estás en mi mente
Mil kilómetros se restan cuando dos almas se suman a lo lejos puedo ver
Solo pienso, solo pienso en ti
Solo pienso, solo pienso en ti
Ya mis primos saben tu apellido que por ti yo estoy perdido, espero que también te pase a ti
Llegará diciembre
Sigues en mi mente
Fueron seis meses y por fin volveré a verte
Llegará febrero yo seré el primero
En darte flores y decirte que te quiero
Puede que pase un año más de una vez
Sin que te pueda ver
Pero el amor es más fuerte
Puede que el tiempo nos aleje otra vez
Sin saber dónde estés
Pero el amor es más fuerte
Ooooh oh oh oh oh
Te esperaré porque el amor es más fuerte
Ooooh oh oh oh oh
Te esperaré porque el amor es más fuerte
Y yo te conocí en primavera
Me miraste tú de primera

Lyrics:

(Traicionera)
Sebastián Yatra
(Mentirosa)
Yatra, Yatra

Tú me dices que no es cierto que te mueres por mí
Si es verdad que no te gusto, no te acerques así
Me dijeron que te encanta que se mueran por ti
Buscando al que se enamora, para hacerlo sufrir

Si me dices que me amas, no te voy a creer (no)
Tú me dices que me quieres y no puedes ser fiel (no)
Me dejaste manejando solo y triste, mujer (no)
Te confieso, si lo quieres saber, si lo quieres saber, yeh

Traicionera
No me importa lo que tú me quieras
Mentirosa
Solo quieres que de amor me muera

Traicionera
En mi vida, fuiste pasajera
Mentirosa
No me importa que de amor te mueras

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Uoh, oh, oh, oh
Mentirosa
No me importa que de amor te mueras

Vives bailando reggaeton-ton-ton
Y no te importa para nada lo que sienta el corazón
Solo te importa el pantalón-lón-lón
Y se te nota, desde lejos, tu maléfica intención

Y mira, no es tan fácil
Enamorarme nunca fue tan fácil
Cuando estás cerca de mí, no es fácil
Y es que la vida se volvió difícil, solo por ti

Si me dices que me amas, no te voy a creer (no)
Tú me dices que me quieres y no puedes ser fiel (no)
Me dejaste manejando solo y triste, mujer (no)
Te confieso, si lo quieres saber, si lo quieres saber, yeh

Traicionera
No me importa lo que tú me quieras
Mentirosa
Solo quieres que de amor me muera

Traicionera
En mi vida, fuiste pasajera
Mentirosa
No me importa que de amor te mueras

Uoh, oh, oh, oh
Uoh, oh, oh, oh
Mentirosa
No me importa que de amor te mueras

Tú me dices que no es cierto que te mueres por mí
Si es verdad que no te gusto, no te acerques así

Traicionera
No me importa lo que tú me quieras
Mentirosa
Solo quieres que de amor me muera

Traicionera
En mi vida, fuiste pasajera
Mentirosa
No me importa que de amor te mueras

Uoh, oh, oh, oh
Uoh, oh, oh, oh
Mentirosa
No me importa que de amor te mueras

Uoh, oh, oh, oh
Uoh, oh, oh, oh
Mentirosa
No me importa que de amor te mueras

Songs from Encanto, by LinManuelMiranda, are coming soon to vinyl at Disney Music Emporium. Pre-order now: https://disneymusic.co/EncantoVinylDMEDos

Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Encanto” tells the tale of an extraordinary family, the Madrigals, who live hidden in the mountains of Colombia, in a magical house, in a vibrant town, in a wondrous, charmed place called an Encanto. The magic of the Encanto has blessed every child in the family with a unique gift from super strength to the power to heal—every child except one, Mirabel (voice of Stephanie Beatriz). But when she discovers that the magic surrounding the Encanto is in danger, Mirabel decides that she, the only ordinary Madrigal, might just be her exceptional family’s last hope.

Director: Paloma Valencia
Producer: Verónica Vélez Olano

Lyrics:

Blessings for every girl that never ramp with men's feelings
You're the one I want in my life yeah baby
Hey yo’ Yatra Guaynaa Guaynaa

Debo confesar
Ahora estoy buscando algo más
Una razón para volverme a enamorar
Puede que seas tú

Quiero una chica quiero una ya
El amor de mi vida
Una que pueda amar

Quiero una chica quiero una “Yal”
Quiero una mujer que sea muy especial
Quiero una dama que me sepa amar
¡Y por supuesto que se sepa menear oye!

Quiero una chica quiero una “Yal”
Quiero una mujer que sea muy especial
Quiero una dama que me sepa amar

Que no diga que no que no que no que
Que la toque y se aloque loque loque loque
Que baile y le rebote bote bote bote
Por eso la quiero
Pa’ que ella me quiera

Que no diga que no que no que no que
Que la toque y se aloque loque loque loque
Que baile y le rebote bote bote bote
Por eso la quiero
Pa’ que ella me quiera

Me monté en un barco
He cruzado el mar, he subido el río
Por usted me he buscado mis líos
Quiero me que abrace en Bogotá en la noche hay frío
Y que me sobes el pelo mami mientras me quedo dormido
Necesito alguien pa’ conversar
Necesito alguien pa’ reír y alguien pa llorar
Alguien que coma mucho
Alguien que salga a rumbear
Pa’ quitarle los tacos cuando lleguemos de bailar

Quiero una chica quiero una “Yal”
Quiero una mujer que sea muy especial
Quiero una dama que me sepa amar
¡Y por supuesto que se sepa menear oye!

Quiero una chica quiero una “Yal”
Quiero una mujer que sea muy especial
Quiero una dama que me sepa amar

Si yo fuera tú, le
Bajo un poco esa actitud que
Me tiene de ti distante
Piénsalo un instante
Puede ser que yo te encante

Si yo fuera tú, le
Bajo un poco esa actitud que
Me tiene de ti distante
Piénsalo un instante
Puede ser que yo te encante bebé

Quiero una chica, quiero una Ya!
Quiero una mujer que sea muy especial
Quiero una dama que me sepa amar
Y ahora esta noche ella me va a besar

Quiero una chica, quiero una Ya!
Quiero una mujer que sea muy especial
Quiero una dama que me sepa amar
Y por supuesto que me sepa besar Oye!

Mi chichi

This is the 11th song of his fourth studio album ""The Search,"" and thus far, NF has made us laugh, cry, angry, but this is one of those times, he made us feel pity and sad him. 

""Hate Myself"" explores his failures in wrecked relationships due to a certain traumatic event - a harrowing moment that set his course. He emphatically speaks about everything he's had ever bear witness to, and love lives that have been crushed. One of the deepest song ever, that I have repeated hundreds of time. One of his greatest songs.

// LYRICS // Alan Walker - Faded // LYRICS //

You were the shadow of my light
Did you feel us
Another start
You fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us
Alive
Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
Was it all in my fantasy
Where are you now
Were you only imaginary
Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monsters running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost
I'm faded
These shallow waters, never met
What I needed
I'm letting go
A deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing
Alive
Where are you now
Where are you now
Under the bright
But faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monsters running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost
I'm faded

Lyrics:
Eyes up, you’ve been gone for a Fortnite
My love, are you stuck in a fake life?
Can’t win, if the prize is to waste your time
Now it’s wasting mine

And I know that we’re close but I’m lonely
Make me your only
Won't win a trophy
But can it kiss you like this when you hold me
Missing it low-key
I’ll say it slowly

It's me or the PS5
Tell me how you wanna spend your night
Three’s feeling way too tight
So if it’s not me then I’m probably gonna run it over
Me or the PS5
Tell me which of us is more your type
Seems like you can’t decide
So if it’s not me then I’m probably gonna run it over

TXT
My love, know I’m in for the long ride
I’m not playing games of the wrong kind
Could be keeping secrets and telling lies
But i’m just online
And I can promise you 
I’ll never play you, I'll find a way to show you I’m grateful
And so I'm begging you
Two minutes only, you’ll get the trophy, I’m staying faithful
 
It’s me and the PS5
Tell me why you makin’ me decide
Please don't you see I’m live
So if you don't leave I can find a way to win you over
Me and the PS5
Least you know where imma be at night
Scores never been this high
(so high)
So if you don't leave I can find a way to win you over

Me or the PS5 (x3)

// LYRICS // Alan Walker & Ava Max - Alone Part 2 // LYRICS //

[Verse 1]

We were young, posters on the wall
Praying we're the ones that the teacher wouldn't call
We would stare at each other
'Cause we were always in trouble
And all the cool kids did their own thing
I was on the outside always looking in
Yeah, I was there but I wasn't
They never really cared if I wasn't

[Pre-Chorus]
We all need that someone who gets you like no one else
Right when you need it the most
We all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on
A friend through the highs and the lows

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone

[Verse 2]
Then I saw your face, your forgiving eyes
Looking back at me from the other side
Like you understood me
And I'm never letting you go, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
We all need that someone who gets you like no one else
Right when you need it the most
We all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on
A friend through the highs and the lows

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone

[Interlude]
I'm not gonna make it alone (La, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone)
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you are that someone that gets me like no one else
Right when I need it the most
And I'll be the one you rely on, a shoulder to cry on
A friend through the highs and the lows

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it alone

Lyrics:

[Verse 1 - Tomine Harket]:
We're not in love
We share no stories
Just something in your eyes
Don't be afraid
The shadows know me
Let's leave the world behind

[Chorus]:
Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it
Let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side
Fall in to the dark side
Give into the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side

[Verse 2 - Au/Ra]:
Beneath the sky
As black as diamonds
We're running out of time
Don't wait for truth
To come and blind us
Let's just believe their lies

[Pre-chorus - Au/Ra]:
Believe it, I see it
I know that you can feel
No secrets worth keeping
So fool me like I'm dreaming

[Chorus]:
Take me through the night
Fall in to the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it
Let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side
Fall in to the dark side
Give into the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side

[Chorus]:
Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it
Let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side
Fall in to the dark side
Give into the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side

Walker Racing League is back 🏁 I’m happy to finally be able to share this song and music video with you all. Creating this song was both fun and challenging, incorporating such an iconic melody. @imanbekmusic1549 and I had a great time working on this project together. It was an incredible experience filming at these amazing locations and bringing more of the story to life.

// LYRICS // Alan Walker x Imanbek - Sweet Dreams // LYRICS //

You’re like the mist 
In the morning 
You’re a moment 
Body warming 
 
I can’t resist 
Where you going 
Make me an ocean 
Overflow it 
 
Sweet dreams of your love 
Keeping me up 
Can’t get enough 
Sweet dreams of your touch 
Do what you want 
Just keep it up 
To the rhythm of the
Bee bap - 
 
Waves 
As they roll in 
As they’re growing 
Can’t control ‘em 
 
Caught in a haze 
Up on the ceiling 
You got me feeling 
I must be dreaming 

Sweet dreams of your love 
Keeping me up 
Can’t get enough 
Sweet dreams of your touch 
Do what you want 
Just keep it up 
To the rhythm of the
Bee bap -

Lyrics:

I’m sorry but
Don’t wanna talk
I need a moment before i go
It`s nothing personal

I draw the blinds
They don’t need to see me cry
Cause even when they understand
They don’t understand

So then when I’m finished
I’m all ‘bout my business
And ready to save the world
I’m takin my misery
Make it my bitch
Can’t be everyone’s favourite girl

So, take aim and fire away
I’ve never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way

Lo siento mucho, pero me voy
Por que a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy
Y me cansé de luchar y de guerrear en vano
De estar en la línea de fuego y de meter la mano
Acepto mis errores, también soy humano
Y tu no vez que lo Hago por que te amo

Pero ya, no tengo mas na' que hacer aquí
Me voy, llego la hora de partir
En mi propio camino seguiré lejos de ti

So, take aim and fire away
I’ve never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way

// LYRICS // Alan Walker - Alone // LYRICS //

Lost in your mind
I wanna know
Am I losing my mind?
Never let me go

If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart, but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

Unconscious mind
I'm wide awake
Wanna feel one last time
Take my pain away

If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart, but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I know I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I know I'm not alone

Verse 1:

You’re miserable inside your mind
Oh my, oh my
Been dancing in circles round your lies
You’re stepping on the dreams
Of everyone you meet
This stupidness will get you high (?)

Hook:
Why don’t you just shut up
I’m telling you we’ve had enough of
You and all your bullshit
We’ve heard it all before

Why don’t you just shut up
I know you gonna come
But so, what
Won’t catch you on the fall cuz
You Can’t hurt us anymore

Why don’t you just shut upx2

Verse 2
I wonder what happened to you
Oh my oh my
To make you want to spin the truth
All night all night
You sink your teeth insult
To injury and we watch
Your high horse running on the loose

Hook:
Why don’t you just shut up
I’m telling you we’ve had enough of
You and all your bullshit
We’ve heard it all before

Why don’t you just shut up
I know you gonna come
But so, what
Won’t catch you on the fall

Can’t hurt us anymore

Why don’t you just
Shut up x 2
Why don’t you please
Why don’t you just shut up

Hope you guys like this track - it's a remake of the instrumental ”Spectre” that I released a few years ago. Some of you might recognize it as it’s been part of my live shows lately. It’s a song that I specifically want to dedicate to my core fans, who’ve been following me since the start. Excited to hear what you think, leave your comment in the section below!

Lyrics:
Hello, hello
Can you hear me
As I scream your name
Hello, hello
Do you need me
Before I fade away

Is this a place that I call home
To find what I've become
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie

Deep in the dark
I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie

Hello, hello
Nice to meet you
Voice inside my head
Hello, hello
I believe you

Slut Me Out Lyrics

Aye, rip off my shirt if you love me
Spit in my face when you fuck me
Play with my gooch while you suck me
Eat the dick like you was ugly
I mean, hold on, wait
Where your friend? Bring your buddy
I don’t think that you enoughie
Her favorite thing to say is cuff me

Slut me out
Slut me out
Slut, slut , slut me out
Rip off my shirt if you love me (sexy)
Spit in my face when you fuck me (come sex me)
Play with my gooch while you suck me (come text me)
Eat the dick like you was ugly (caress me)

Big dick energy I give it
Don’t believe me then come feel it
Gone put this here in your kidney please
And hush it like some kidney beans
Suck my balls
Come chickpea me
Why you being weird to me
Put your ass in my face till I get pink eye
Fuck you anywhere
Im that type guy
At the church
On the plane
At the basketball game
Ion care imma bus my nut till I die
What position do I like
All of them baby
Put it on camera
Masterbate to it later
Ever sucked a vegan dick
Baby come taste me
Promise that my nut taste like sugar gravy
Don’t come quick
I control my bladder
Dick real big
Come climb my ladder
Fat coochies , lil coochies, all coochies matter
Ass real fat, I can make it fatter
Wanna see a magic trick
Bend over backwards
Meat to meat
Wall to wall
Coochie to my balls dawg

Aye, rip off my shirt if you love me
Spit in my face when you fuck me
Play with my gooch while you suck me
Eat the dick like you was ugly
I mean, hold on, wait
Where your friend? Bring your buddy
I don’t think that you enoughie
Her favorite thing to say is cuff me
Slut me out
Slut me out
Slut, slut , slut me out

Lyrics:
CashMoneyAP
Ooh, ooh, no, no
NLE the Top Shotta

Posted, in front of the trap
Selling dope, 'till the sun come down
Take a fuck nigga right off the map
When I hit him, with this whole hundred rounds
Young joc, in the club, with my Glock
You want to play and then this bitch going down
We ain't hesitatin', bullets get to blazin'
Imma lay him down like he in the lounge

Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down

Walk down on 'em in Balenciaga runners
My blood, slime a nigga out, just like a anaconda
You go against me, then you fuck, just like a used condom
I roll 'em up, and then I smoke 'em, like some good ganja
Ay, still doing drive-bys, but I want to walk 'em
If I can't find 'em, you know I'm gonna stalk 'em
Caution tape up on the scene, I had to white chalk 'em
Running from my gun, but my bullets had to hawk 'em

Posted, in front of the trap
Selling dope, till the sun come down
Take a fuck nigga right off the map
When I hit him, with this whole hundred rounds
Young joc, in the club, with my Glock
You want to play, and then this bitch going down
We ain't hesitatin' bullets get to blazin'
Imma lay him down like he in the lounge

Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down

Nigga, I was posted on the corner, where the jays at
Roll up in the four by four, pull at the corner store
And I got red in my drink, when I pour up soda
I remember praying that the feds never take the Motorola
Choppa got the choppa, make 'em do a backflip
Pay my dog a dime to walk him down, he need the racks bitch
I've been drinkin, I been taking all this codeine to the face
Got a lot of m's in the safe
Caught a murder, then I beat the case
I was just about to do the race

Posted, in front of the trap
Selling dope, till the sun come down
Take a fuck nigga right off the map
When I hit him, with this whole hundred rounds
Young joc, in the club, with my Glock
You want to play, and then this bitch going down
We ain't hesitatin' bullets get to blazin'
Imma lay him down like he in the lounge

Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down
Walk 'em down

Official Lyrics

Rubber band hunnids 
This shit keep on comin 
Im th th th th th th th th th thumbin

Move like a mummy
The drip got them slumpy
A ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju junkie 

Add to the commas if it’s about money 
I'm thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thumbin
Used to be bummin
Turned nothing to something 
I got my bank account ju ju ju jumping 

Rubber band hunnids 
This shit keep on comin 
Im th th th th th th th th th thumbin

Move like a mummy

A ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju junkie 

Add to the commas if it’s about money 
I'm thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thumbin
Used to be bummin
Turned nothing to something 
I got my bank account ju ju ju jumping 

Hunnid band, hunnid band,
Guns in the sprinter van 
Never play middle man 
We gotta get a man 
If I don’t feel him, man 
We gotta kill a man 
Spin like a celling fan
Not for the dividends
Reapin the benefits
Like he a immigrant 
Lot of artilery 
Special delivery 
Show my agility
And my ability 
Go on a killing spree
Like we the military 

Play with my cash, and I’m on your ass 
Like the pockets on the back of your pants 
Lay on my stash like you was a mattress 
Pillow cases filled up with my bands 
couple grand in the attic
Another grand like magic 
Thats mathematics
Getting paid is a habit 
Ballin like I was a maverick
Or John Madden

Rubber band hunnids 
This shit keep on comin 
Im th th th th th th th th th thumbin

Move like a mummy
The drip got them slumpy
A ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju junkie 

Add to the commas if it’s about money 
I'm thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thumbin
Used to be bummin
Turned nothing to something 
I got my bank account ju ju ju jumping 

Rubber band hunnids 
This shit keep on comin

Move like a mummy

A ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju junkie 

Add to the commas if it’s about money 
I'm thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thumbin
Used to be bummin

I got my bank account ju ju ju jumping 


Polo G

I’m thumbing through bands and racks
Deep in that water bitch it aint no friends in that 
First n***a playing get wacked
Scope on a new glock I got a lens attached
Like my shooter got aim assist
He bound to hit anything that he blammin' at 
Catch him and bang em quick
Empty the clip twelve hollows gon lay in his back 

Money counters beeping
Blue strip dreams while I’m sleeping
40 with a beam if they creeping 
Too turnt gang what I’m bleeding 
Snatch who chain Bitch I’m squeezing 
Bullets patch his brain, he aint breathing 
Was posted in the rain with some heathens
Look how far I came
They can’t believe it

Lyrics:
Don't, don't play with her, don't be dishonest (Ayy)
Still not understandin' this logic (Ayy)
I'm back and I'm better (And I'm better)
I want you bad as ever
Don't let me just let up
I wanna give you better
Baby, it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl, I'm that somebody, so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over 'cause you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high
Shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
Lookin' at you I'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
Play this song for him, tell him, ""Just listen""

Don't
Don't

Mann Le Ve Sajjna

Tere Bina Mera Howe Na Guzara
Chhad Ke Na Jawin Mainu
Tu Hi Hai Sahara

Lyrics:

Yeh Bhi Na Jaane
Woh Bhi Na Jaane
Naino Ke Rang Naina Jaane
Mila Jo Sang Tera
Uda Patang Mera
Hawa Mein Hoke Malang

Jag Ki Koi Reet Na Jaane
Main Toh Bas Teri Hui Deewani
Mila Jo Sang Tera
Uda Patang Mera
Hawa Mein Hoke Malang

Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Ab Tu Hi Hai Sansaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Yeh Paagal Sa Hai Pyaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera

O Makhna Ve Makhna
Yeh Paagal Sa Hai Pyaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna...

Teri Hi Baatein Ho
Subah Si Raatein Ho
Jab Se Mila Hai Tu
Dil Ko Mila Sukoon
Tu Hi Raah Meri, Tu Hi Safar Hai
Teri Baahon Mein, Ab Mera Ghar Hai

Chain Na Jaane Dard Na Jaane
Dil Toh Bas Dil Ko Pehchaane
Mila Jo Sang Tera
Uda Patang Mera
Hawa Mein Hoke Malang

Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Ab Tu Hi Hai Sansaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Yeh Paagal Sa Hai Pyaar Mera

Kyaa baat haii
Mujhko tere ye ishaare samaj nahi aate 
Lekin dil ne sun li hai teri dil waali baatein, 
Mujhko tere ye ishaare samaj nahi aate 
Lekin dil ne sun li hai teri dil waali baatein; 
Tere lakk ton tu lagda Karachi di 
Fan marjaniye Bugatti di
Dil kare tere naal banneyaa ravaan 
Tere jism’ch khushboo elachi di 
Ni tera kajal
Karda ae pagal 
Hypnotize kare jatt nu

Uspe yeh mashallah muhn 
Kyaa baat haii

Lagg ni paiyaan
Paiyaan badi hot marrjaniye 
Tenu takk ke mennu
Aande gande thought marjaniye 
Gallan ne gulabi vich toye nakhro 
Karde ne munde hoye hoye nakhro 
Jedha tennu takk lava ikk vaar ni

Lyrics...
I can’t work you out 
Are you thinking
bout something better
Holding onto you
While you drag me
through stormy weather

The only time you smile
Is in the photographs
When I pull you close
It’s like you’re holding back
Before we turn to strangers
Tryna love in the dark

Tell it to my heart
Cos I can’t keep guessing
If it’s me you’re missing
 
Tell it to my heart
Cos the sound of silence
Is a place we’re dying

Tell it to my heart
Tell it to my heart

Tell it to my heart
Cos I can’t keep guessing
If it’s me you’re missing
 
Tell it to my heart
Cos the sound of silence
Is a place we’re dying
Tell it to my heart

Before a light goes out
Come and tell me now
If somethings fading
Cos I can feel it in
Every single thing that you’re not saying

You move close to me
But I can feel a space
Whatever time we have
I’m not gonna waste
Before we turn to strangers
Tryna love in the dark

Tell it to my heart
Cos I can’t keep guessing
If it’s me you’re missing
 
Tell it to my heart
Cos the sound of silence…

Tell it to my heart
Tell it to my heart
 
Tell it to my heart
Cos I can’t keep guessing
If it’s me your missing

Tell it to my heart
Cos the sound of silence
Is a place we’re dying
Tell it to my heart",True,True,147630326.0,Not Found

LYRICS:

To all things housed in her silence  
Nature offers a violence  
The bear that keeps to his own line  
The wolf that seeks always its own kind  
The world that hardens as the harsher winter holds 
The parent forced to eat its young before it grows 
Every bird, gone unheard  
Starving where the ground has froze  
The winter sun rise, red on white  
Like blood upon the snow (2x)
Like Blood upon the snow  

The ground walked here is a wonder  
It ceases never to hunger  
And all things nature’s given  
She takes all things back from the living  
I’ve walked the Earth, and there are so few here that know  
How dark the night,  
And just how cold the wind can blow  
I’ve no more hunger now to see where the road will go 
I’ve no more kept my warmth  
Than blood upon the snow  
Blood upon the snow (3x) 

It’s not my arms that will fail me  
But this world takes more strength than it gave me  
The trees deny themselves nothing that makes them grow  
No rain fall, no sunshine  
No blood upon the snow  
Blood upon the snow (3x)

To all things housed in her silence  
Nature offers a violence

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

Lyrics:

Don't take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey there is no right way
And so I fall in love just a little ol' little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
There's an art to life's distractions
To somehow escapes the burning weight, the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else, I guess any thrill will do
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey there is no right way
And so I fall in love just a little ol' little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I wake at the first crink of morning
And my heart's already sinned
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha, that you would pray for him?
'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little ol' little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day
Love with every stranger the stranger the better
Love with every stranger the stranger the better
Love with every stranger the stranger the better
Love with every stranger the stranger the better
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new

BIO
3x Grammy award-winning superstar, Lizzo has become a household name with over 5 billion global streams and a platinum selling debut album to date. With the help of anthemic smash hits like the 7x Platinum “Truth Hurts,” the 3x Platinum “Good As Hell,” and the 2x Platinum “Juice,” Lizzo released her Nice Life Recording Company/Atlantic Records debut album CUZ I LOVE YOU on April 19th 2019, debuting at #6 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart and spending 24 consecutive weeks in the chart’s Top 10. “Truth Hurts” became the longest running #1 by a solo female rap artist in history after spending seven weeks atop the charts. Since the release of the meteoric CUZ I LOVE YOU, Lizzo has been named both Time Magazine and Entertainment Weekly’s 2019 Entertainer of the Year as well as gracing the covers of Rolling Stone, Billboard’s GRAMMY Preview Issue, British Vogue, Elle’s Women In Music Issue, and many others.  Additionally, Lizzo kicked off 2020 with a showstopping opening performance at the 62nd Annual GRAMMY awards and took home three big wins, in addition to being the most-nominated artist of the year. 2020 has also seen her win the awards for Best Female R&B/Pop Artist at the 2020 B.E.T Awards and both “Entertainer of the Year” and “Outstanding Video” at the 2020 NAACP Awards. Her list of high profile TV performances also include the 2019 American Music Awards, VMAs, B.E.T Awards and Saturday Night Live, in addition to in depth profiles on CBS This Morning’s GRAMMY primetime special and CBS Sunday Morning. Now, Lizzo returns with her first new single in two years- the highly-anticipated “Rumors"" featuring Cardi B.

BIO
3x Grammy award-winning superstar, Lizzo has become a household name with over 5 billion global streams and a platinum selling debut album to date. With the help of anthemic smash hits like the 7x Platinum “Truth Hurts,” the 3x Platinum “Good As Hell,” and the 2x Platinum “Juice,” Lizzo released her Nice Life Recording Company/Atlantic Records debut album CUZ I LOVE YOU on April 19th 2019, debuting at #6 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart and spending 24 consecutive weeks in the chart’s Top 10. “Truth Hurts” became the longest running #1 by a solo female rap artist in history after spending seven weeks atop the charts. Since the release of the meteoric CUZ I LOVE YOU, Lizzo has been named both Time Magazine and Entertainment Weekly’s 2019 Entertainer of the Year as well as gracing the covers of Rolling Stone, Billboard’s GRAMMY Preview Issue, British Vogue, Elle’s Women In Music Issue, and many others.  Additionally, Lizzo kicked off 2020 with a showstopping opening performance at the 62nd Annual GRAMMY awards and took home three big wins, in addition to being the most-nominated artist of the year. 2020 has also seen her win the awards for Best Female R&B/Pop Artist at the 2020 B.E.T Awards and both “Entertainer of the Year” and “Outstanding Video” at the 2020 NAACP Awards. Her list of high profile TV performances also include the 2019 American Music Awards, VMAs, B.E.T Awards and Saturday Night Live, in addition to in depth profiles on CBS This Morning’s GRAMMY primetime special and CBS Sunday Morning. Now, Lizzo returns with her first new single in two years- the highly-anticipated “Rumors"" featuring Cardi B.

Oh, ey

You don't know babe
When you hold me

And kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing
And it don't change
If I had it my way
You would know that you are

You're the coffee that I need in the morning
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
Won't you give yourself to me
Give it all, oh

I just wanna see
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Oh you're the best part, oh
You're the best part, oh
Best part

It's this sunrise
And those brown eyes, yes
You're the one that I desire
When we wake up
And then we make love
It makes me feel so nice

You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
You're the sunshine on my life

I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Then you're the best part, oh
You're the best part, oh
Best part

If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you

Lyrics:
               
Do you like the way i talk to you do i tetilate your mind
Gotta say i like your attitude And i love to make you mine

But i gotta know            
Do you really like me
Do you really like me
Low on time i gotta make a move
            
Do you really like me Do you really like me
            
Yh were still young but for how many moons I guess we’ll find out
I guess we’ll wait and see
Know i like you babe
            
Hope you like me
            
Worst case scenario
I get played but hey this aint my first rodeo
I hate that im so jaded yh its cool but overrated I wanna be in love again (ohhhhh)
At first i was fucking yoiur friend
But i wanted you
Are we wrong i guess that depends
Will we end upp together
Will you have my kids you better
I wanna be in love again
            
I guess we’ll find out
I guess we’ll wait and see Know i like you babe
I hope you like me

Lyrics:
Intro:
If I were to go 
Tell me would you 
Notice me 
If I were to go 
Tell me would you
Notice me 

First verse:
24hrs after CS:01 release 
I miss my girl it’s time to hit the streets
I went to check my doc get some vitamin C
You won’t believe what happened to me, I

Drip drip drip with the cold IV
Out of consciousness if I ever slip it

and I woke up in an ambulance 

If I were to go tell me would you notice me 
If I were to go tell me would you notice me 

Second verse:
64 hours since my baby spoke to me 
He kissed me now I love his dopamine 
I tried go to sleep but my brain on 2cb 
You won't believe what happened to me, I
Drip drip drip with the cold iv 
Out of consciousness if I ever slip it


I been gone moving, high speed now 
That's my song let me hear that bounce 
Latin boy Frida Khalo brow 
Jacquemus jeans Ferragamo brown
Venetian walls with porcelain tiles
286 Donnie Darko town 
If I’m down would you help me out 
If I’m down would you help me out

I had to call you back to tell you that (call me back)
You could have spared my feelings (could have spared my feelings)
I'm not invincible, I'm not invincible (oh)

I had to call you back to tell you that (call me back) 
You could have spared my feelings 
I'm not invincible (I'm not invincible) I'm not invincible 


If I were to go tell me would you notice me 
If I were to go tell me would you notice me 
If I were to go tell me would you notice me",True,True,29596755.0,contemporary R&B

🎵 ""Jay Wheeler, Myke Towers - La Curiosidad"" Lyrics: 

[Intro: Jay Wheeler]
Háblame de ti, ¿cómo tú estás?, quisiera verte (Verte)
En una foto te vi y me dieron ganas de comerte (De comerte)
Sé que, al igual que yo, en el amor no has tenido suerte (Suerte)
Pero me matan las ganas de verte (De verte)

[Coro: Jay Wheeler]
La curiosidad me mata y no aguanto
Ya te quiero tener, solo dime cuándo
Es que tú y yo muy bien sabemos
Que es diferente cuando nos comemos (Yeah)

[Verso 1: Myke Towers]
Ey, yo'
Ella e' curiosa, una nena estudiosa (Yeah)
A la' otra' ya las tiene furiosa'
La bañera ella la pone espumosa
Yo le juego y se la dejo jugosa
Posa, yo la retrato y le pongo las esposa'
Marihuana de flore', ella no quiere rosa'
Si no se lo hago en la cabaña, en la carroza
Te ve' hermosa
A mí me dio con verte pero de frente
Yo sé que ere' diferente, ya chequeé su expediente
Y no tiene antecedente', qué bien te ve'
Tu mirada no miente, llama si está' caliente
Y yo sigo aquí, tú siempre pasa' por mi mente (Eh-eh)
A hablarte no me atreví, sé que conmigo no pueden verte (Eh)
Y se dice por ahí que lo que no mata te hace má' fuerte
Si vuelvo a nacer yo volvería a conocerte

[Coro: Jay Wheeler]
La curiosidad me mata y no aguanto
Ya te quiero tener, solo dime cuándo
Es que tú y yo muy bien sabemos
Que es diferente cuando nos comemos (Oh; yeah)

[Verso 2: Jay Wheeler]
Daría lo que fuera por verte de nuevo (De nuevo)
Tranquila, nadie tiene que enterarse
Y no quiero envolverme, pero contigo me atrevo (Me atrevo)
Hace tiempo tengo gana' de tocarte
Y e' que tu arrebato me tiene loco
Y cuando veo tu foto me desenfoco
Dicen que e' de loco' lo de nosotro'
Y no saben lo que pasa cuando te toco (Yeah)
Y quiero repetir, encima de mí quiero volverte a sentir
Contigo la pasé cabrón, no te voy a mentir

[Coro: Jay Wheeler & Myke Towers]
La curiosidad me mata y no aguanto
Ya te quiero tener, solo dime cuándo (Oye)
Es que tú y yo muy bien sabemo'
Que es diferente cuando nos comemo' (Eh)

Lyrics:
Si te preguntan qué pasó entrenos
Que eso se quede entre nosotros dos
No des la versión tuya
Porque eso no me ayuda

Si ni tan malo fui (eh)
Pa’ que hables mal de mi (eh)
Si no es bueno, no digas nada
Y si te cuesta quedarte callada

Ta’ bien diles que no fui el mejor
Pero no me hagas ver como un perdedor
Diles que conmigo conociste el amor
Que no eran frías mis noches en Nueva York

También diles que te hice llorar (oh, oh)
Pero que fue de felicidad (oh, oh)
Mejor pensarlo dos veces antes de hablar
No vaya a ser que tú me vayas a extrañar

Ahora me tienes como el malo del cuento a mi
Después que mi corazón completo te lo di
No te pido que regreses
Pero cuando lo beses
No puedas dejar de pensar en mi

Sé que me escucho egoísta
Pero siento que lo mío me lo quitan
De protagonista te quedó el papel
Jugando un juego donde solamente gana el, pero

Diles también que yo soy el único
Que a ti te eriza la piel
Y te pudo complacer
Cuando ‘toy borracho pienso
En todo lo intense
Que tú y yo
Tuvimos en aquel viejo hotel

Just let me know, nena
Si nada te llena
Muero, vuelvo y nazco y gano de cualquier manera
Just let me know nena
Cuando tú quieras
Te hago el amor como si nada pasó
Roooyce
Ta’ bien diles que no fui el mejor
Pero no me hagas ver como un perdedor
Diles que conmigo conociste el amor
Que no eran frías mis noches en Nueva York

También diles que te hice llorar (oh, oh)
Pero que fue de felicidad (oh, oh)
Mejor pensarlo dos veces antes de hablar
No vaya a ser que tú me vayas a extrañar

Y si te
Preguntan en tu casa
Usa más la cabeza
Luego yo con qué cara voy a beber con tu pai cerveza
Tu mai que tanto me ama
No vaya a ser que me odie
Si se entera lo que hice
Puede que no me perdone

Está cabrón lo sé
Lo nuestro lo maté
Pero fueron más cosas buenas que contigo pasé
Ayer entré a ver tus fotos
Y encontré una de nosotros
Quizás tú quieres volver
A la verdad que ‘toy loco

Ta’ bien diles que no fui el mejor
Pero no me hagas ver como un perdedor
Diles que conmigo conociste el amor
Que no eran frías mis noches en Nueva York

También diles que te hice llorar (oh, oh)
Pero que fue de felicidad (oh, oh)
Mejor pensarlo dos veces antes de hablar
No vaya a ser que tú me vayas a extrañar

Lyric / Letra: “Suelta”

Tu no eres mía todavía, 
Pero te veo pendiente a mi solo a mi
El no te merecía
No sabía ni mentir, no
Te amarro si te veo suelta una vez más
En los mares de tu cuerpo yo quiero navegar 
Quité el seguro de la puerta por si quieres entrar 
La herida de aquel cabrón yo te la puedo curar 
Te amarro si te veo suelta una vez más
En los mares de tu cuerpo yo quiero navegar 
Quité el seguro de la puerta por si quieres entrar 
La herida de aquel cabrón yo te la puedo curar
Encima de ti me monto como en una moto 
Lo hacemos en el balcón aunque nos tiren fotos
De lejos lo noto, se te ve en el rostro
Me quieres a mi, no quiere estar con otro
Y ahora siguen pasando las horas, de ninguno se enamora
Porque le rompieron el cora
Y ya no llora, le tiran pero ella ignora
Quiere louis vuitton no le gusta pandora
Y si te beso por cuello se te paran los pelos
Si ese cuerpo es un hotel baby yo me hospedo 
Como Jhayco Mia Khalifa baby yo me encuevo 
Yo te quiero a ti no quiero un culo nuevo
Te amarro si te veo suelta una vez más
En los mares de tu cuerpo yo quiero navegar 
Quité el seguro de la puerta por si quieres entrar 
La herida de aquel cabrón yo te la puedo curar 
Te amarro si te veo suelta una vez más
En los mares de tu cuerpo yo quiero navegar 
Quité el seguro de la puerta por si quieres entrar 
La herida de aquel cabrón yo te la puedo curar

Y si te veo suelta hoy pa casa te secuestro
Callao nadie sabe lo nuestro
Pero sin ropa puesta, yo por ti me aquieto
Ma’ te lo prometo, tu y yo somos un dueto
Y si me toca morir que sea encima tuyo
Allá abajo hay un río y tranquila que yo fluyo 
Por ti dejo la bebida y hasta el orgullo
Me acuerdo de nuestro primer perreo en marullo 
Mami tu cuerpo es droga y ya yo estoy adicto 
Llegaba en traje y te ibas sin el gistro 
Siempre te hablo claro
Contigo no hay filtro
Cuál es la timidez si esnua te he visto
Te amarro si te veo suelta una vez más
En los mares de tu cuerpo yo quiero navegar 
Quité el seguro de la puerta por si quieres entrar 
La herida de aquel cabrón yo te la puedo curar
Te amarro si te veo suelta una vez más
En los mares de tu cuerpo yo quiero navegar 
Quité el seguro de la puerta por si quieres entrar 
La herida de aquel cabrón yo te la puedo curar

Lyrics -
Dos años en una aventura
Y el pasaje que vuelve a cambiar
Yo le tenía miedo a tanta altura
Y tú una experta de tanto saltar
Me viste perseguir un sueño
Pero sosteniéndome en el piso igual
Se cumplió lo que tú decías
Poco a poco ya me siento menos mal

Un viaje no asegura a casa
Una casa no evita viajar
Dicen que hay gente que es el camino
Y otras que te espera en el lugar

Me cago en esos comentarios
Solo son vivencias que han tenido un par
Porque para mí eres todo
Tú mi carretera que parece hogar
Aahh, ahhh
Ya te conseguí ahora no tengo apuro
Aahh, ahhh
Te estás volviendo mi lugar seguro

Seis meses y parecen más
Vas pa’ tu casa y ya te echo de menos
Los girasoles no tenían sentido
Pero ya lo tienen desde que nos vemos
Y a nadie le queda un mapa del lunar que sabes que me pone mal
Dijiste que arreglé tus daños y tú sin darte cuenta me curaste igual
Soy fanático de tu locura y cómo te ves en ropita interior
Y aunque mides poco nadie está a tu altura
No eres la primera pero sí mi único amor
Y cuando te siento lejos es como un zapato sin su otro par
Porque para mí eres todo
Tú mi carretera que parece hogar
Aahh, ahhh
Ya te conseguí ahora no tengo apuro
Aahh, ahhh
Te estás volviendo mi lugar seguro

Mi lugar seguro
Porque para mí eres todo
Tú mi carretera que parece hogar

Como tú ninguna y como yo no hay otro

Yo quiero estar solo para ti, ma'
Tiene' toda' la' qualitie'
No hay necesidad de otra má', no voy a mentir
Yo puedo tenerte muy bien
Te compro zapato' y cartera y te monto en un Benz
Yo quiero estar solo para ti, ma'
Solamente para ti, esto' lo que quieren e' bajarte el panty (Ja)
Tiеne' que cortarme a to' lo' friеnds
Tranquila, que yo le corto a to'a esta' puta' también

Creo que me envolví, no sé cómo pasó
Lo que me hace' sentir no lo había sentido
Un enchule como novio' de décimo
La' cosa' que hacemo' nunca la' decimo'
Estás muy dentro de mí
Mami (Mami), I got you (Got you)
Only (Only), seré tuyo
Ese infeli' te dejó solita
Dile que ahora yo 'toy aquí, no lo necesita'
Tu cuerpo con mi cuerpo tiene una conexión
Contigo e' que yo siento ese vibe
Por ti a to'a esta' puta' le' digo ""bye"" (Bye, bye, bye)
Hablándote claro, no sé bien cómo expresar lo que me está pasando
Pero lo que sé e' que solo e' contigo (Contigo)
Solamente me pasa contigo (Contigo)
Y si te estoy mintiendo que me castigue Dio'
Hablándote claro, no sé bien cómo expresar lo que me está pasando
Pero lo que sé e' que solo e' contigo (Contigo)
Solamente me pasa contigo (Contigo)

Flipeando taquilla pa' comprarte diseñador
Tú quería' Loui, Ferragamo, lo mejor
Contigo yo estaba Nicky Jam, flow Ganador
Ahora pa' olvidarte la' Oxy con Panadol, la' bajé con alcohol
Mañana no quiero despertar
No me juegue', ma', por favor
Que ya yo no te quiero besar
Si tu' labio' son de otro (Otro)
Dime qué pasó entre nosotro' (Nosotro')
Yo peleando con mi' demonio'
Ahí fue que empezaste a ver lo' mostro' (Mostro')
Si tu' labio' son de otro (Otro)
Dime qué pasó entre nosotro' (Nosotro')
Yo peleando con mi' demonio'

Yo sé que ha pasa'o tiempo y lo siento (Siento)
Lo que sé e' que 'tamo en nuestro momento (-mento)
To'a la' vece' que peleamo' lo lamento (-mento)
Baby, si yo no te tengo, me atormento (-mento)
Y pose' te hice como doce
Tú viste la luna y le gritaste voce'
Baby, esta noche anotamo' doble
Y toda' la' que faltan, eso si no lo sé

Te juro que desde que tú llegaste le' picha'o a to'a la' babie' por ti (Por ti; ja)
Y yo no era de amarrame, pero no voy a negar que contigo me envolví
Lo bueno lo quiere to' el mundo y por eso te celo (Celo)
Ante' tenía el corazón frío como hielo
Pero desde que lo hicimo' a la' otra' la' cancelo
Extraño cuando despertaba y tu ropa estaba en el suelo, yeah-yeah (Ja; yeah-yeah)
A ti ninguna te supera (-pera)
Pa' mí tú siempre será' la primera (-mera)
No vo'a dejar que lo nuestro se muera (Ja), yeah-yeah (Yeah-yeah)
A ti ninguna te supera (-pera)
Pa' mí tú siempre serás la primera (-mera)
No vo'a dejar que lo nuestro se muera, ah

And I would give the world for you, baby
I cannot think about ever curvin' you, baby
You got that cinnamon with the swirl for me, baby
Let's get it poppin', I got a spot in the crib, put on the shower and hop in
I'm tryna make your day (Make your day)
I pull up on you like mami: ""¿Qué lo que?"" (¿Qué lo que?)
Givin' it to you, you couldn't stay away
And I couldn't stay away neither
I wasn't playin' you neither, I'll be prayin' that you see it my way

Yo quiero estar solo para ti, ma'
Tiene' toda' la' qualitie'
No hay necesidad de otra má', no voy a mentir
Yo puedo tenerte muy bien

(Hablándote claro, no sé bien cómo expresar lo que está pasando)
Bry, Bry, Bryant Ma (Pero lo que sé e' que solo e' contigo)
Dímelo, Teck
(Solamente me pasa contigo
Y si te estoy mintiendo que me castigue Dios
Hablándote claro, no sé bien cómo expresar lo que está pasando
Pero lo que sé e' que solo e' contigo
Solamente me pasa contigo)

► Testo

Sei l'ennesimo sbaglio che potevo anche evitare
Su un tetto al primo appuntamento solo per gridare
Vedersi solo per scopare, poi precipitare giù
E fuori è nebbia fitta
E perché ora stai zitta?
E cosa vuoi che dica?
E come fai tu, come fai a fare sempre finta
E poi darmi una spinta e farmi andare giù?

Tanto lo sai, farò il panico
Come sempre, dimmi ora che fai
Bevo il solito
Sarà tossico e so che non mi farà
Più come una volta
Due buttafuori mi stanno scortando alla porta
Non ho mai avuto un piano, ora ne ho un paio di scorta
Per il panico

Io sono quello che resta per ultimo
A guardare tutti mentre se ne vanno
Entro sempre più freddo e più vuoto
Sembra Milano il primo dell'anno
Sembra che faccio finta di niente
Ma ogni giorno mi allego più storie
So che lo sai come ci si sente
A stare senza un angelo custode

Viviamo come senza un giorno dopo
Lascio l'auto con le chiavi dentro
E corro a prenderti un vestito nuovo
Che starà meglio sul pavimento
Spingo finché quel rimmel ti cade
Tu sei il bene, ma diventi il male
Siamo un capolavoro del cinema
Con un finale da dimenticare

E tanto lo sai, farò il panico
Come sempre, dimmi ora che fai
Bevo il solito
Sarà tossico e so che non mi farà
Più come una volta
Due buttafuori mi stanno scortando alla porta
Non ho mai avuto un piano, ora ne ho un paio di scorta
Per il panico

Forse anche stanotte
Perdo la voce per dire niente
Penso alle nostre ferite aperte
Sfondo le porte solo se serve

Tanto lo sai, farò il panico
Come sempre, dimmi ora che fai
Bevo il solito
Sarà tossico e so che non mi farà
Più come una volta
Due buttafuori mi stanno scortando alla porta
Non ho mai avuto un piano, ora ne ho un paio di scorta
Per il panico

Rondo X BLUE CHEESE feat. Lazza

Te lo ricordi quando in tasca non avevo nada 
Quando andavamo allo sportello ma non erogava
Zero pensieri zero sogni e pure zero grana 
Qualcuno sulle nostre tracce come Zenigata
Quei giorni in cui ci andava male e pensi Dio non c’è 
Tu che aspettavi di trovare quella bitch online 
Però non c’era brother c’ero solo io con te 
Quei giorni che stavi alle corde tipo six 1 nine 
Ora che ho 100 nei miei blu jeeeans 
Lei mi chiede di fumare bluucheees 
Mi chiedo se ci credi o no sei ready o no 
Come quando ci ascoltavamo i Fugees 

Tu fatto famiglia, io ho fatto carriera 
Ovunque vado mi fanno saltare le file 
L’ultima volta in zona la tua faccia era offesa
Giuro che prima o poi mi faccio sentire

Non ti ho mai risposto no 
Nulla e corrisposto è 
Questi cosa vogliono da me 
La vita è così bella ma io non me la godo e
Tutto sembra andare veloce anche se 

Dimmi cosa resterà di noi 
Cicatrici addosso come rasoi 
Sarà l'ultimo ricordo e poi 
Svaniremo come fumo oramai 

Dimmi cosa restera' di noi 
Se ci finiremo sopra un tabloid 
Tengo stretta quella polaroid 
Spero ci tenga lontani dai guai 

Prima di cantare la vita era una merda 
Non è cambiato nulla vivo ancora di merda 
Non mi importa dei soldi sono una conseguenza 
Ma da quando ho iniziato la gente sembra diversa
Che poi alla fine siamo solamente anime 
Un altro anno e sto bruciando come cenere 
Ormai nulla sembra colmare il malessere 
Tanto non scendono manco più le lacrime 
Lei è bad sta nella trap vuole un vero bad boy 
Una montagna di racks stelle della Rolls Royce 
Brillano su di lei 
Non chiamare i tuoi non sanno dove sei 
Vestiti veloce che torniamo alle 6 
Sto arrivando sotto dimmi quando ci 6 
Lontana km io ti troverei 
I tuoi occhi brillano mischiati coi miei 

Non ti ho mai risposto no nulla e corrisposto e
Questi cosa vogliono da me 
La vita è così bella ma 
Io non me la godo e 
Tutto sembra andare veloce anche se 

Dimmi cosa resterà di noi 
Cicatrici addosso come rasoi 
Sarà l'ultimo ricordo e poi 
Svaniremo come fumo oramai 

Dimmi cosa restera' di noi 
Se ci finiremo sopra un tabloid 
Tengo stretta quella polaroid 
Spero ci tenga lontano dai guai

She told me that she loved me by the water fountain
She told me that she loved me and she didn't love him 
And that was really lovely cause it was innocent 
But now she's got a cup with something else in it 
It's getting kinda blurry at a quarter past ten 
And he was in a hurry to be touching her skin 
She's feeling kinda dirty when she's dancing with him 
Forgetting what she told me by the water fountain
Now he's grabbing her hips and pulling her in 
Kissing her lips and whispering in her ear 
And she knows that she shouldn't listen 
And that she should be with me by the water fountain 
She couldn't be at home in the night time because 
It made her feel alone but at that time she was too young 
I was too young 
I should've built a home with a fountain for us 
The moment that she told me that she was in love too young 
I was too young 
Too young 
Too young 
Too young 
Young 
And if she ever goes back to the water fountain 
The handle will be broken and the rust set in 
But my hand it will be open and I'll try to fix it 
My heart it will be open and I'll try to give it 
Now I'm grabbing her hips and pulling her in
Kissing her lips and whispering in her ear 
And I know that it's only a wish 
And that we're not standing by the water fountain 
Too young 
Too young 
Too young 
Young 
She couldn't be at home in the night time because 
It made her feel alone but at that time she was too young 
I was too young 
I should've built a home with a fountain for us 
The moment that she told me that she was in love too young 
I was too young 
Too young 
Too young 
Too young 
Young

this is a story about a girl who builds a castle out of her insecurities.
Press show more for lyrics and credits 

A paper crown 
And a heart made of glass 
A tattered gown 
And a kingdom of ash 
She walks alone 
She can never look back 
The story of a queen whose castle has fallen to the sea 
She’ll make it out 
But she’s never the same 
She’s looking down 
At the scars that remain
But you hold your ground 
When your kingdoms in flames
Cause it’s the story of a queen 
Whose castle has fallen to the sea
Knowing there’s no one who will be 
A king that will come and save his queen 

When all she needs 
When all she wants 
When all she finds 
When all she is 
And ever was 
Is compromised 
Cause there’s no one to love you
When you build your walls 
Too high 
And there’s no one to love you 
When you build your walls to 
High 

She’s looking out 
From the war that’s inside 
She’s screaming out 
Cause no one survived
But when you’re all alone 
You wait and you hide 
Cause it’s the story of a queen
Whose castle has fallen to the sea 
Knowing there’s no one who will be 
A king that will come and save his queen 


When all she needs 
When all she wants 
When all she finds 
When all she is 
And ever was 
Is compromised 
Cause there’s no one to love you
When you build your walls 
Too high 
And there’s no one to love you 
When you build your walls to 
High 

There’s no one 
Who is strong enough 
To save your love 
There’s no fairytale 
There’s no fairytale 


When all she needs 
When all she wants 
When all she finds 
When all she is 
And ever was 
Is compromised 
Cause there’s no one to love you
When you build your walls 
Too high 
And there’s no one to love you 
When you trap yourself inside

I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Is this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side

I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause

I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Lady, running down to the riptide

Lyrics 
Oh Saturday Sun 
I met someone 
Out on the west coast 
I gotta get back I can’t let this go 
Oh Saturday Sun 
I met someone 
Don’t care what it cost 
No ray of sunlights ever lost 

So tired of sleeping alone  
So tired of eating alone 
I need to ask her what’s going on 
Are we going strong?

She felt like resting her head
My shoulder was the perfect height 
We fit so right 
So what’s going on cause I’ve been undone 

The long drive, the coastline 
Looking out at first light 
Am I still on her mind?
I’ve been undone

Oh Saturday Sun 
I met someone 
Out on the west coast 
I gotta get back I can’t let this go 
Oh Saturday Sun 
I met someone 
Don’t care what it cost 
No ray of sunlights ever lost 
Ever Lost

Ba Ba 

And still the memories right there 
She put the breeze in my hair 
No kiss was softer, softer than this 
I’m reading her lips 

Oh each line, I read
She left her books in my bed 
And her song in my head 
I’ve been undone 

Oh Saturday Sun 
I met someone 
Out on the west coast 
I gotta get back I can’t let this go  
Oh Saturday Sun 
I met someone 
Don’t care what it cost 
No ray of sunlights ever lost 
Ever lost 

Ba Ba, Ba Ba, Ba Ba BaBaBaBa

Oh Saturday Sun 
I met someone 
Out on the west coast 
I gotta get back I can’t let this go  
Oh Saturday Sun 
I met someone 
Don’t care what it cost 
No ray of sunlights ever lost 
Ever lost 

 Ba Ba, Ba Ba, Ba Ba BaBaBaBa

Lyrics:
I’ve been waiting for the tides to change
For the waves to send you my way
I see you darling but you pixilate
It gets hard to take these days

But we’ll hold the line I won’t let go
Cause I’ll be there when you can finally make it home
And I don't mind cause we both know that we’ll be fine when you can finally make it home

Because when I'm in a room with you that missing piece is found
You know when you’re by my side Darling nothing can bring us down

I remember happy wasted days
Summers golden haze in our eyes
Lifting you above the breaking waves
Memories floating back to my mind

You said hold the line I won’t let go
Cause I’ll be there when you can finally make it home
And I don't mind
Cause we both know
That we’ll be fine when you can finally make it home

Because when I’m in a room with you that missing piece is found
You know when you’re by my side darling nothing can bring us down
It’s like when you’re far away from me I get lost in the crowd
Because when I’m in a room with you that missing piece is found

Oooh I won’t waste a minute when you’re here
And we’re finally in the clear
When every day is like the last
I just keeping holding fast

Because when I’m in a room with you that missing piece is found
You know when you’re by my side darling nothing can bring us down
Its like when you’re far away from me I get lost in the crowd
Because when I’m in a room with you that missing piece is found

Lyrics:
Talking like we used to do 
It was always me and you 
Shaping up and shipping out 
Check me in and check me out 
Do you like walking in the rain?
When you think of love do you think of pain?
You can tell me what you see 
I will choose what I believe

Well hold on darling 
This body is yours
This is body is yours and mine
Well hold on my darling 
This mess was yours 
Now your mess is mine 
Ah ooo
Your mess is mine

See you in the market place
Walking round at eight am 
Got two hours before my flight 
Luck be on my side tonight 
You’re the reason that I feel so strong 
The reason that I’m hanging on 
You know you gave me all that time 
Well did I give enough of mine?

Well hold on darling 
This body is yours
This is body is yours and mine
Well hold on my darling 
This mess was yours
Now your mess is mine 
Ah ooo
Your Mess is mine
Your Mess is mine

Bring me to your house 
And tell me sorry for the mess 
Hey I don’t mind
You’re talking in your sleep out of time
Well you still make to sense to me 
Your mess is mine
Ah ooo
Your Mess is mine
oooo
This body is yours and this body is mine
ooo
Your mess is mine

Lyrics:
The day began like all the rest 
A frantic beating in my chest 
A panicked reeling in my brain 
Perspective lost but nothing gained 
I was so stuck inside my shell
Then the ground began to sway
I realised what mattered most, To me 

When the stars began to fall right out of the sky 
And the seas were rising up 
I had one thing in mind 
It was you it was you it was you 
It was you it was you it was you 
When the road began to crumble in front of my eyes 
There was only one person I wanted to find 
It was you, it was you, it was you 
It was you, it was you, it was you, darling, hey hey hey 

The precious moments that we shared 
You slowed time down inside my head 
I wish I'd found this clarity 
While I still had you close to me 

But I was stuck inside my shell 
Until the ground began to sway 
I realised what mattered most, that day 

When the stars began to fall right out of the sky 
And the seas were rising up 
I had one thing in mind 
It was you, it was you, it was you 
It was you, it was you, it was you  

When the road began to crumble in front of my eyes 
There was only one person I wanted to find 
It was you, it was you, it was you 
It was you, it was you, it was you, darling, hey hey hey 

When the stars began to fall right out of the sky 
And the seas were rising up 
I had one thing in mind 
It was you, it was you, it was you 
It was you, it was you, it was you 

When the road began to crumble in front of my eyes 
There was only one person I wanted to find 
It was you, it was you, it was you 
It was you, it was you, it was you, darling, hey hey hey 

It was you it was you it was you 
Darling, hey hey hey  

It was you, it was you, it was you

Lyrics:
She is something to behold, elegant and bold 
She is electricity, running to my soul 
Oh oh oh 

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time 
Calling me to come back to bed, singing Georgia on my mind
And I, And I 

Lips, generous and warm
You build me up like steps
Eyes, innocent and wild 
Remind me what its like
Oh oh oh 

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time 
Pulling me back into the flames, and I’m burning up again, I’m burning up 
And I, I never understood what was at stake 
I never thought your love was worth its weight 
And now you’ve come and gone, I’ve finally worked it out, I’ve worked it out 

I never should of told ya
I never should of let ya see inside
Don’t want no trouble in your mind
Won't you let it be

I never should of told ya
I never should of let ya see inside
Don’t want no trouble in your mind
Won't you let it be

I never should of told ya
I never should of let ya see inside
Don’t want no trouble in your mind
Won't you let it be

I never should of told ya
I never should of let ya see inside
Don’t want no trouble in your mind
Won't you let it be

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time 
Pulling me back into the flames, and I’m burning up again, I’m burning up 
And I, I never understood what was at stake 
I never thought your love was worth its weight 
And now you’ve come and gone, I’ve finally worked it out, I’ve worked it out 

Oh I, oh oh oh, ooo

Lyrics:
I saw you standing there, 
Sandy blonde hair,
The way it came tumbling down 
Just like a waterfall 
And if you need a light 
I’ll be the match to your candle 
My darlin I’m ready 
To burst into flames for you 

I was just coasting till we met 
You remind me, just how good it can get 
Well I’ve been on fire, dreaming of you 
Tell me you don't it feels like you do 
Looking like that you’ll open some wounds 

How does it start and when does it end 
Only been here for a moment but I know I want you 
But is it to soon?
To know that I’m with you 
There’s nothing I can do 

And sometime around one
We fell asleep to escape from the sun and we woke up, to the sound of a storm outside 
We stood at your front door, you looked at me and said baby this rain changes everything 
And my heart ran away from me 

I was just coasting till we met 
You remind me, just how good it can get 
Well I’ve been on fire, dreaming of you 
Tell me you don’t it feels like you do 
Opening up can open some wounds 
How does it start and when does it end 
Only been here for a moment but I know I want you 
Darlin I do

I’m with you 
There’s nothing I won’t do 

To see you, shine, I'll swing for the fences I’ll run to the line, 
And its high, time, that you love me cause you do it so well, 
To see you shine, I’ll swing for the fences I’ll run to the line 
And its High, High Time
Oh Darlin, I’m with you 
Oh Darlin, I’m with you 
There’s nothing I won’t do
There’s nothing I won’t do 

I’m with you 
Oh Darlin I’m with you

Lyrics: 
I was only walking through your neighbourhood
Saw you out loud honey in the cold I stood
Anywhere I go there you are
Anywhere I go there you are

I been getting used to waking up with you
I been getting used to waking up here
Anywhere I go there you are
Anywhere I go there you are

There you are
There you are

You're the fire and the flood
And I'll always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your hand is resting next to mine
Next to mine
You're the fire and the flood

Since we met I feel a lightness in my step
You're miles away but I still feel you
Anywhere I go there you are (anywhere)
Anywhere I go there you are
Late at night when you can't fall asleep
I'll be lying right beside you counting sheep
Anywhere I go there you are (anywhere)
Anywhere I go there you are (anywhere)

There you are
There you are

You're the fire and the flood
And I'll always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your hand is resting next to mine
Next to mine
You're the fire and the flood

Now listen here she said
Boy when you know you'll know
And I know

You're the fire and the flood
And I'll always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your hand is resting next to mine
Next to mine
You're the fire and the flood

Lyrics:
Time to let it go
It won’t let go of me
Hanging by a thread
Cutting the cord and then falling back in
The black cause if I don't
If I wait till it feels right
I’ll be waiting my whole life
Closing my eyes remember how we were like

Gold when you see me
High If you need me 
Babe that's the way it was 
That's the history 
Blue how we used to roar 
Like an open fire 
That's the way it was 
But that's history

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's the way it was
But that's history
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's the way it was
But that's history

I have a memory
You're visiting me at night
Climbing in my bed
You were so quiet that you never woke me
I love the way you could
See the good in everything
But, do we fuel the fire?
Closing my eyes, remember how we were like

Gold, when you see me
Hi, if you need me
Babe, that's the way it was
That's the history
Blue, how we used to roar
Like an open fire
That's the way it was
But that's history

Started with a word
Now, look at where we are
Everything we've done
It's there on our faces for anyone willing to
Read between the lines
Now, look at where we are
Everything we've done
It's there on our faces for anyone willing to

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's the way it was
But that's history
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's the way it was
But that's history

Well, I got a feeling
Darling, it's possible
'Cause love's got no ceiling
Now, that it's just so strong
And I got a feeling
Like everything is possible
I'm trying to change

Gold, when you see me
Hi, if you need me
Babe, that's the way it was
That's the history
Blue, how we used to roar
Like an open fire
That's the way it was
But that's history

Started with a word
Now, look at where we are
Everything we've done
It's there on our faces for anyone willing to
Read between the lines
Now, look at where we are
Everything we've done
Started out with just one

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Gold, when you see me
Hi, if you need me
Babe, that's the way it was
But that's history

Walker Racing League is back 🏁 I’m happy to finally be able to share this song and music video with you all. Creating this song was both fun and challenging, incorporating such an iconic melody. @imanbekmusic1549 and I had a great time working on this project together. It was an incredible experience filming at these amazing locations and bringing more of the story to life.

// LYRICS // Alan Walker x Imanbek - Sweet Dreams // LYRICS //

You’re like the mist 
In the morning 
You’re a moment 
Body warming 
 
I can’t resist 
Where you going 
Make me an ocean 
Overflow it 
 
Sweet dreams of your love 
Keeping me up 
Can’t get enough 
Sweet dreams of your touch 
Do what you want 
Just keep it up 
To the rhythm of the
Bee bap - 
 
Waves 
As they roll in 
As they’re growing 
Can’t control ‘em 
 
Caught in a haze 
Up on the ceiling 
You got me feeling 
I must be dreaming 

Sweet dreams of your love 
Keeping me up 
Can’t get enough 
Sweet dreams of your touch 
Do what you want 
Just keep it up 
To the rhythm of the
Bee bap -

Lyrics:
So many lovers ago
You’re still my number one
People always tell me time will heal
But they don’t know what we
Had was just like a dream
Little did we know it was true love

Wish I knew, wish I knew what I had from the start
Wish I knew, wish I knew

Sometimes I regret that I even met you
That would’ve saved me an ocean of tears
I keep on swimming right into the deep blue
Still kinda warm in this ocean of tears

Ocean of tears
Ocean of tears

Too many others ago
You’re still the one I want
I’m talking to myself or is it you
Still following around
The whispers in the dark
But when I look around I see no one

Wish I knew, wish I knew what I had from the start
Wish I knew, wish I knew

Sometimes I regret that I even met you
That would’ve saved me an ocean of tears
I keep on swimming right into the deep blue
Still kinda warm in this ocean of tears

Ocean of tears
Ocean of tears
Ocean of tears
Ocean of tears

Sometimes I regret that I even met you
That would’ve saved me an ocean of tears
I keep on swimming right into the deep blue
Still kinda warm in this ocean of tears

Ocean of tears
Ocean of tears
Ocean of tears
Ocean of tears

Fake Lyrics
Watching you drop a stack,
On another coke and jack,
Ahu You’re comatose, ahu
Louis bag painted black,
Bought your friends a booth in back,
Ahu You’re comatose, ahu
 
Everybody’s waiting for something, for something,
They all want, what you have but they say nothing, they say nothing
 
You look so bad with your Louis V and plaid,
They hate your ass cause you just got paid,
Rich dad, heart tatts, does it ever get you sad,
That your life’s a wreck and all your friends fake
 
Popping pills, knock them back,
Watch the floor turn into black,
You’re overdosed, you’re overdosed,
Looking for misery,
Take your boat out to the sea
Just let it row, just let it row.
 
Everybody’s waiting for something, for something,
They all want, what you have but they say nothing, they say nothing,
 
You look so bad with your Louis V and plaid,
They hate your ass cause you just got paid,
Rich dad, heart tatts, does it ever get you sad,
That your life’s a wreck and all your friends fake

LETRA:

This is the remix.
Tiene a todo el mundo buscándola.
Dice que en mi casa está secuestrada.
Un video en mi cama esposándola.
Dice que aquí se quiere quedar.

69 posiciones y la dejo.
Yo lo sé, cogemos como conejos.
Y eso es lo que a mí me corre de ti.
Que se muerda, que estoy puesto pa' ti.
Déjale saber.

Yo no puedo compartirte.
Eres como la clave de mi celular.
No es necesario decirte que...

Yo te quiero pa' mí, no te quiero pa' más nadie.
Solita pa' mí, no te comparto con nadie.
A mano armada fue que te robé.
Y él como un loco anda buscándote.

Te quiero pa' hacerte feliz enseguida.
Hagamos un trío, tú y yo y toda la vida.
Que no te tenga en Insta, no es que no te siga.
Te quiero pa' mí, no importa lo que digan.
Todos, a veces me enojo.
Dime qué ves, ya que tú eres mis ojos.
Hablando claro, de la forty me despojo.
Pero diles que están vivos, por vivos y no por flojos.

Caras vemos, corazones no sabemos.
Pero a ti te conozco hasta el pelo.
Ai, se eu te pego, flow Michel Teló.
Tú querías bellaquear, pues, malo.

69 posiciones y la dejo.
Yo lo sé, cogemos como conejos.
Y eso es lo que a mí me corre de ti.
Que se muerda, que estoy puesto pa' ti.

Yo te quiero pa' mí, no te quiero pa' más nadie.
Solita pa' mí, no te comparto con nadie.
A mano armada fue que te robé.
Y él como un loco anda buscándote.

No te confundas con mi flow, Rosario Tijeras.
Que por más que parezco mala, no estoy para cualquiera.
No soy la más que le mete, ni tampoco la más bonita.
Pero le gustó el piquete, el flow de esta mamacita.
Ni Gucci ni Prada, ningún Louis Vuitton.
No quiero nada de eso, pon tu habitación.
Voy a llevarte preso en mi peli de acción.
Vas a sentirme en tus besos y en tu corazón.
Bebé, ¿quién era esa, que te causó tanta tristeza?
Te llena de dudas, te da dolor de cabeza.
Si peleas conmigo, lo resolvemos en la pieza.
Y si no llegamos, lo hacemoS encima de la mesa.

Y ahora yo soy el que te lo pone a ti sin condones.
Y él ya no lo puede evitar.
Y si le duele que la abandone o se me encojone.
¿Pa' qué no te supo cuidar?
Baby, solo apaga tu teléfono.
Ponte las Balenciaga, dale, vámonos.
Cojamos carretera y perdámonos.
Y como caníbales más comámonos.

Yo te quiero pa' mí, no te quiero pa' más nadie.
Solita pa' mí, no te comparto con nadie.
A mano armada fue que te robé. 
Y él como un loco anda buscándote.

Así como suena, yeh.
¿Cómo estás? yo te quiero pa’ mí, pero él la alenta.
Como me calientas, como tú te sueltas.
Entiende que tú eres mía y no te voy a prestar.
Sígueme que yo te sigo.
Llegando a Medellín, te entrego el anillo.
Y al pirobo de tu novio, yo me lo vacilo.
Y a las otras les picheo porque estoy contigo.

Que te siga buscando que él no te va a encontrar.
Ahora está conmigo y él no te va a tocar.
Y que no trate de forzar porque le puede costar.
Y aunque no tenga sueño lo podemos acostar.
Esto es sin hablar, porque no soy de roncar.
Pero tu eres mía, lo tienes que aceptar.
Que ahora conmigo es que vas a despertar.
Y solamente él te puede imaginar.

Yo te quiero pa' mí, no te quiero pa' más nadie.
Solita pa' mí, no te comparto con nadie.
A mano armada fue que te robé. 
Y él como un loco anda buscándote.

Como un loco él te anda buscando.
No se da cuenta que estás pichándolo.
Siempre que te llama, estás ignorándolo.
Porque estás conmigo, nena, díselo.
Díselo, que tú a mí me quieres.
Que ya se jodió, por otras mujeres.
No vas a volver, por más que te espere.
Y ahora yo soy al que tú prefieres.

Yo no puedo compartirte.
Eres como la clave de mi celular.
No es necesario decirte que...

Yo te quiero pa' mí, no te quiero pa' más nadie.
Solita pa' mí, no te comparto con nadie.
A mano armada fue que te robé. 
Y él como un loco anda buscándote.

Dalex
Música refrescante, bebé.
Dímelo Flow.
Rike Music.
Rich Music.
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh.
Yo te quiero pa' mí.
Uh-uh...
