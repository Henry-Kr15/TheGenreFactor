[Verse 1]
No sir, no sir, no sir
New Maybach but I ain't got a chauffeur
I'm in it for the bread, put you in a toaster
Ayy, yes sir
Ayy, ayy, got it lil older was a young flexer
You know it's a go 'cause bitch, my jacket checkered
Pop one pill but it's a double decker
Dududuh, ayy
Yes sir, I ain't talkin' schools but I'm waitin' on a transfer
Send a pussy boy to meet my ancestors
Pull up on the block, it's hot, flamin', Chesters
Ayy, yes sir
I just flew a bitch in from Manchester
They took me to jail, I should've smacked the arrestor
Hop out the car flexin' like Sylvester
Ayy, ayy
No sir, bitch just pulled up in I8 roaster
Track cost too much, told that bitch ""No, sir""
Ain't no fuckin' cryin' on my fuckin' shouldеr
Hundred dollar steak and I don't like thе texture
You can die today, just scratch out yester'
Diamonds on my ring, money like a wrestler
Took away the good, it wasn't a good gesture
Is your whip bullet proof? I'll be the tester
Test that shit out like a damn semester
Walked up in the club, had to change the weather
Put that bitch out, she's probably seekin' shelter
They asked me what I want, I said ""I want forever""
Bitch keep callin' the phone, I had to send her an error
I said ""I'm gon' call you back"" but I can't remember
I want two bitches, who number one contender?
Baby, tell me what I can do to make it better
Ice got me shivering and I'm wearin' a sweater
Walkin' on the P's and gettin' G's, Vector
Chief So', will put you on a shirt, yes sir
Ayy, no sir
Back seemin' farther but I'm gettin' closer
He'll kill his momma for a lil' exposure
And he left her body where the fuckin' crows were

[Interlude]
Ayy, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes sir, yes sir
Yes sir

[Verse 2]
She be tryna smoke and everytime I be big worm
Heart cold as heart burn
She tryna see what terms we on, I start talkin' outta turn
She came to give me brain but I can't even learn
Did it while I'm drivin', I can't even turn
Lawyer so good, I bought him a law firm
Everytime he beat the case, well done

[Interlude]
Whoo, yes sir
Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir

[Verse 3]
We'll put you on a stretcher
This bitch five thousand, no crying on my sweater
She want some green to buy a purse
That bitch sixty thousand, stupid bitch, you got nerve
Sent a couple shots, the last one was back burnt
Ain't learned by now, the dumbass would never learn
I was trappin' and folks decided to commit a murder
Tryna rob a trapper? Stupid bitch, don't get murdered
Seen my penmanship on a bitch, you need some cursive
All these niggas be jelly, I think it's perservatives
Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir
This shit is real confidential, sir
Oh, you puttin' out our business, we gon' come and get you, sir
Have your people tellin' the news that you had potential, sir?
You a goofy, you get used like a utensil, sir
Get your old ass shot with this new pistol, sir
Smokin' dope up in the telly, fuck the incidental, sir
And this Lambo' mines, no, it's not rental, sir
I'm on my way to get the money 'cause it's essential, sir
Talkin' 'bout you can stop me, well, why didn't you, sir?
Check my fuckin' facecard, check my credentials, sir
I might pull up in a Bentley Continental, sir
Best shit I ever wrote, this shit monumental, sir
But I didn't write that shit, they like why didn't you, sir?
How the fuck you havin' all that shit up in you, sir?
Got a AK the same height as Kendall, sir
I'm a dog so that bitch want me in a kennel, sir
Runnin' to you in the club, it's coincidental, sir


[Outro]
Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes yes, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir

no sir..

""ABALO EMOCIONAL""
Te falei não confunda as coisas
Melhor nem se apegar
Posso não tá mais aqui quando acordar

Te avisei não sou flor que se cheira
Mas essa abelha é teimosa
Me cheira e ainda me beija com essa boca gostosa

Ta aí o motivo 
Do meu abalo emocional
Fico ou não fico
Vou ou não vou
É lance ou amor?

E aí chegou pousando na minha revoada
Freou minha boca que era acelerada
Ela é porrada, ô baixinha invocada

Chegou pousando na minha revoada
Freou minha boca que era acelerada
Ela é porrada, ô baixinha invocada
Conseguiu tirar o mel de onde ninguém tirava...

Quando eu te conheci pensei
Vou dar o golpe e eu que levei
Tentei roubar o coração de uma ladra

Dona da lei
Eu não queria te amar, te amei
Eu não queria me entregar, me entreguei
Eu não queria me jogar, eu me joguei
Eu não queria...

Ta aí o motivo 
Do meu abalo emocional
Fico ou não fico
Vou ou não vou
É lance ou amor?

E aí chegou pousando na minha revoada
Freou minha boca que era acelerada
Ela é porrada, ô baixinha invocada

Chegou pousando na minha revoada
Freou minha boca que era acelerada
Ela é porrada, ô baixinha invocada
Conseguiu tirar o mel de onde ninguém tirava...

""CORAÇÃO CIGANO""
É que eu queria tanto que você ficasse
Que ao invés de me soltar, você me abraçasse
Dá só mais um pouquinho desse amor cigano
Que segue me iludindo, e eu acreditando

Fazer o que se ela roubou o meu juízo?
Fazer o que se eu tô me sentindo vivo?
Tirou o meu chão, me levou pro colchão
E fez acampamento em outro coração

Coração cigano, cigano
Segue me enganando, mudando
De cheiro em cheiro, de beijo em beijo
E aqui no meu olhar morando, oh

Coração cigano, cigano
Segue me enganando, mudando
De cheiro em cheiro, de beijo em beijo
E aqui no meu olhar morando

Yeah (coração cigano)
Segue me enganando

Do que você me dá, eu quero sempre mais
Por uma hora ou duas noites, tanto faz
Já leu minha mão, meu olhar, meu futuro
Já sabe: Se manda mensagem, eu nem durmo
Me leva pro céu, lá de cima me joga
Esse amor cigano é um caminho sem volta

Fazer o que se ela roubou o meu juízo?
Fazer o que se eu tô me sentindo vivo?
Tirou o meu chão, me levou pro colchão
E fez acampamento em outro coração

Coração cigano, cigano
Segue me enganando, mudando
De cheiro em cheiro, de beijo em beijo
E aqui no meu olhar morando, oh

Coração cigano, cigano
Segue me enganando, mudando
De cheiro em cheiro, de beijo em beijo
E aqui no meu olhar, aqui no meu olhar

Você não entra mais, chega
Coração disse: Chega
Mas por que meu Deus colocou numa só tanta beleza?
E se eu chego à toa e vou tirando a roupa
Se eu disser que não quero, ri, que essa piada é boa

Coração cigano, cigano
Segue me enganando, mudando
De cheiro em cheiro, de beijo em beijo
E aqui no meu olhar morando, coração cigano

Coração cigano, cigano
Segue me enganando, mudando
De cheiro em cheiro, de beijo em beijo
E aqui no meu olhar, e aqui no meu olhar morando

""ERRO PLANEJADO""
Um erro cometido mais que uma vez
É uma decisão
Desculpa, mas não tem como eu te dar duas vezes
O meu perdão

Ninguém foi lá naquele bar
Colocar uma boca na sua boca e te obrigar a beijar
Eu não tava lá na sua mente
Mas eu sei que esse erro foi pensado, planejado e consciente

A culpa é sempre de uma briga, de umas pinga
De uma amiga que te arrasta pra rua
Mas as perna é sua
Você é sempre inocente, mente que nem sente
E sempre erra como nunca, uô

A culpa é sempre de uma briga, de umas pinga
De uma amiga que te arrasta pra rua
Mas as perna é sua
Você é sempre inocente, mente que nem sente
Sempre erra como nunca

Era só terminar antes de trair
Era só terminar que eu deixava cê ir

Ninguém foi lá naquele bar
Colocar uma boca na sua boca e te obrigar a beijar
Eu não tava lá na sua mente
Mas eu sei que esse erro foi pensado, planejado e consciente

A culpa é sempre de uma briga, de umas pinga
De uma amiga que te arrasta pra rua
Mas as perna é sua
Você é sempre inocente, mente que nem sente
Sempre erra como nunca

A culpa é sempre de uma briga, de umas pinga
De uma amiga que te arrasta pra rua
Mas as perna é sua
Você é sempre inocente, mente que nem sente
E sempre erra como nunca, uô

""MORENA""
Composição: Luan Santana, Lucas Santos, Breno César, Shylton Fernandes, Diego Barão
Produzido por Lucas Santos

Você podia ter caprichado menos no beijo
Devia ter pegado leve na hora de amar
Podia ter falado não ao invés de aceito
Talvez a história da gente não tava onde tá

O que eu dei pra você, tudo
Tudo que eu tinha pra dar
E do quê que adiantou, nada
Você só queria brincar

Se eu não conseguir dormir
Não é cafeína
É culpa da morena
Do beijo da morena

Se na balada eu zerar
Não faltou esquema
É culpa da morena
Do beijo da morena

Me diz o quê que eu posso fazer 
Se ela rouba a cena
Se até deitado no colo da loira 
Eu lembro da morena

Parei no segundo exato
Que os seus lábios falsos tocaram os meus
Sempre que alguém me perguntava
Dizia sinto nada, o amor evaporou, morreu

Mesmo sabendo que as minhas chances 
São praticamente nulas
O meu coração ainda te procura
Lá vou eu deitar na minha cama
Me virar pro outro lado e esquecer
Não esqueci...

Se eu não conseguir dormir
Não é cafeína
É culpa da morena
Do beijo da morena

Se na balada eu zerar
Não faltou esquema
É culpa da morena
Do beijo da morena

""PERIGO NOTURNO""
O risco de um solteiro, quando ingere álcool,
É perder o celular numa balada,
Embebedar na volta e errar de casa.
Amanhecer com alguém que nunca viu na vida,
Apagar um caminhão de stories que postou, mas não devia
Mas são riscos de solteiros normais, que saem, dane-se, tanto faz
Mas não é meu caso, o risco que eu corro é te perdoar no auge do meu álcool

De nós dois eu me arrependo de tudo,
Dos trocentos te amo,
Dos beijos suando
Das noites que nois “dormiu” junto
Mas às 3h da madruga, rodado na rua
A carência procura um assunto.
E eu vou atrás de quem eu fujo

Você é meu perigo noturno

""ILHA""
Composição: Luan Santana
 
Quero que prometa
Que se comprometa
A ir procurar outro amor em outro planeta
Pra que eu não te veja
Sentada na mesa
Rindo à toa enquanto outra boca 
Te beija
Ai ai ai

Vou engolir meu coração
Pra me amar por dentro
Que nós dois sabemos
Que tanto sofrimento
É perda de tempo
É perda de tempo

Vou transformar decepção
Em novo começo
O passado é um erro
O presente é só acerto
O amor eu te prometo

Também vou procurar
Outro amor em outro planeta
Guardo seu ciúme em qualquer gaveta
Primeiro a gente peita
Depois a gente aceita
Que amores vem, amores vão
Você vai pro céu, volta pro chão

E quando tá pra se afogar
No mar da vida
Vem alguém, vem alguém
Que se torna ilha... 

Vou engolir meu coração
Pra me amar por dentro
Que nós dois sabemos
Que tanto sofrimento
É perda de tempo
É perda de tempo

Vou transformar decepção

O amor eu te prometo

Também vou procurar
Outro amor em outro planeta
Guardo seu ciúme em qualquer gaveta
Primeiro a gente peita
Depois a gente aceita
Que amores vem, amores vão
Você vai pro céu, volta pro chão

E quando tá pra se afogar

Vem alguém, vem alguém
Que se torna ilha...

Lyrics

Girl I still kiss your head in the morning
Make you Breakfast in bed while your yawning
And I don't do everything, how you want it
But you can't say your man, Don't be on it

Cause I know true love aint easy. 
Girl I know it's you, Cause you complete me. 
And I just don't want you to leave me, 
Even tho I give you reasons

[Chorus:]
Cause baby sometimes, 
I can tell just by your face this part of us been gone for so long. 
And I know there's no replacing what we had going on... for so long.

But When it hurts, I can make it better. 
Girl if it works, it's gone be forever. 
We been through the worst, Made it through the weather. 
Our problems and the pain... (pain), But Love Don't Change

Girl you still hold me close when you see me. 
And you still make me know that you need me.
And I know sometimes you don't believe me. 
But you stay on my mind, So believe me.

Cause you have my heart don't break it (Oh no don't break it girl)
Girl when times get tough, Don't hate me (ohhhh)
And it all adds up, we gone make it (gotta make it)
Cause when you mad, I know you can't fake it (ohhhhhhhhh)

Cause baby sometimes, 
I can tell just by your face this part of us been gone for so long (so long). 
And I know there's no replacing what we had going on... for so long.

But When it hurts, I can make it better. 
Girl if it works, it's gone be forever. 
We been through the worst, Made it through the weather. 
Our problems and the pain... (pain), But Love Don't Change

[Jeremih - Verse 3:]
Hold me down and I'm gone do the same... 
for you girl, I will do a thing... 
for you love, I want this together even though it gets better... Or worse

[Chorus:]
Cause baby sometimes, 
I can tell just by your face this part of us been gone for so long. 
And I know there's no replacing what we had going on... for so long.

But When it hurts, I can make it better. 
Girl if it works, it's gone be forever. 
We been through the worst, 
Made it through the weather. 
Our problems and the pain... (pain), But Love

But When it hurts, I can make it better. 
Girl if it works, it's gone be forever. 
We been through the worst, 
Made it through the weather. 
Our problems and the pain... (pain), our Love don't... Change...",False,False,152382468.0,contemporary R&B

LYRICS
Got a figure like a pin-up, got a figure like a doll
Don't care if you think I'm dumb, I don't care at all
Candy bear, sweetie pie, wanna be adored
I'm the girl you'd die for

I'll chew you up and I'll spit you out
'Cause that's what young love is all about
So pull me closer and kiss me hard
I'm gonna pop your bubblegum heart

I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
Hit me with your sweet love, steal me with a kiss
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch

Queentex, latex, I'm your wondermaid
Life gave me some lemons so I made some lemonade
Soda pop, soda pop, baby, here I come
Straight to number one

Oh, dear diary, I met a boy
He made my doll heart light up with joy
Oh, dear diary, we fell apart
Welcome to the life of Electra Heart

I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
Hit me with your sweet love, steal me with a kiss
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch

I think I want your, your American tan
Oh, oh, oh
I think you're gonna be my biggest fan
Oh, oh, oh

I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
Hit me with your sweet love, steal me with a kiss
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch

I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
Hit me with your sweet love, steal me with a kiss
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch

Electra Heart is the girl you run into in the supermarket wearing a faux fur coat and sunglasses, leisurely picking through the avocado. Her cart is filled with champagne and strawberries and she doesn’t even care that you’ve been staring at her from the bakery aisle. She’s angsty, and you can tell that her phone conversation didn’t end well by the way she dramatically dropped her phone and wiped a solitary tear from her cheek. The same cheek that has a eyeliner-drawn heart on it.

LYRICS
[Chorus]
Primadonna girl, yeah
All I ever wanted was the world
I can't help that I need it all
The primadonna life, the rise and fall
You say that I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got you wrapped around my finger, babe
You can count on me to misbehave
Primadonna girl

[Verse 1]
Would you do anything for me?
Buy a big diamond ring for me?
Would you get down on your knees for me?
Pop that pretty question, right now baby
Beauty queen on a silver screen
Living life like I'm in a dream
I know I've got a big ego
I really don't know why it's such a big deal though

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Ooh) And I'm sad to the core, core, core
(Yeah) Every day is a chore, chore, chore
(Wow) When you give, I want more, more, more
I wanna be adored

[Chorus]
Cause I'm a Primadonna girl, yeah
All I ever wanted was the world
I can't help that I need it all
The primadonna life, the rise and fall
You say that I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got you wrapped around my finger, babe
You can count on me to misbehave
Primadonna girl

[Verse 2]
Fill the void up with celluloid
Take a picture, I'm with the boys
Get what I want cause I ask for it
Not because I'm really that deserving of it
Living life like I'm in a play
In the limelight, I want to stay
I know I've got a big ego
I really don't know why it's such a big deal, though

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Ooh) Going up, going down, down, down
(Yeah) Anything for the crown, crown, crown
(Wow) When the lights dimming down, down, down
I spin around

[Chorus]
Cause I'm a Primadonna girl, yeah
All I ever wanted was the world
I can't help that I need it all
The primadonna life, the rise and fall
You say that I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got you wrapped around my finger, babe
You can count on me to misbehave
Primadonna girl, yeah
All I ever wanted was the world
I can't help that I need it all
The primadonna life, the rise and fall
You say that I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got you wrapped around my finger, babe
You can count on me to misbehave

“The Family Jewels is a body of work largely inspired by the seduction of commercialism, modern social values, family and female sexuality. Each song was intricately produced and written by myself, and my only hope is for it to be enjoyed and consumed as a story and theory that encourages people to question themselves.” - MARINA

LYRICS
[Verse 1]
Don't do love, don't do friends
I'm only after success
Don't need a relationship
I'll never soften my grip

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't want cash, don't want card
Want it fast, want it hard
Don't need money, don't need fame
I just want to make a change
I just wanna change
I just wanna change
I just wanna change
I just wanna change!

[Chorus]
I know exactly what I want and who I want to be
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy
Oh, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh!

[Verse 2]
One track mind, one track heart
If I fail, I'll fall apart
Maybe it is all a test
Cause I feel like I'm the worst
So I always act like I'm the best

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If you are not very careful
Your possessions will possess you
TV taught me how to feel
Now real life has no appeal
It has no appeal
It has no appeal
It has no appeal
It has no appeal!

[Chorus]
I know exactly what I want and who I want to be
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy
Oh, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh!

I know exactly what I want and who I want to be
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy
Oh, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh!

[Bridge]
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna die
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna fail, gonna die, die, die, die...

[Chorus]
I know exactly what I want and who I want to be
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy

LYRICS
[Verse 1]
Rule number one
Is that you gotta have fun
But, baby, when you're done
You gotta be the first to run
Rule number two
Just don't get attached to
Somebody you could lose
So le-let me tell you

[Chorus]
This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singin' I lo-lo-lo-love you
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like the look of danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do
Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you

[Verse 2]
Rule number three
Wear your heart on your cheek
But never on your sleeve
Unless you want to taste defeat
Rule number four
Gotta be looking pure
Kiss him goodbye at the door
And leave him wanting more, more

[Chorus]
This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singin' I lo-lo-lo-love you
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like the look of danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do
Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you

[Bridge]
Girls, we do, whatever it will take
Cause girls don't want
We don't want our hearts to break, in two
So it's better to be fake
Can't risk losing in love again, babe

[Chorus]
This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singin' I lo-lo-lo-love you
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like the look of danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do
Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do

LYRICS
[Verse 1]
I wanna be a bottle blonde
I don’t know why but I feel conned
I wanna be an idle teen
I wish I hadn’t been so clean
I wanna stay inside all day
I want the world to go away
I want blood, guts and chocolate cake
I wanna be a real fake

[Chorus]
Yeah, I wish I’d been a
Wish I’d been a teen, teen idle
Wish I’d been a prom queen, fighting for the title
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
Feeling super, super (super!) suicidal
The wasted years, the wasted youth
The pretty lies, the ugly truth
And the day has come where I have died
Only to find I’ve come alive

[Verse 2]
I wanna be a virgin pure
A 21st century whore
I want back my virginity
So I can feel infinity
I wanna drink until I ache
I wanna make a big mistake
I want blood, guts and angel cake
I’m gonna puke it anyway

[Chorus]
Yeah, I wish I’d been a
Wish I’d been a teen, teen idle
Wish I’d been a prom queen, fighting for the title
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
Feeling super, super (super!) suicidal
The wasted years, the wasted youth
The pretty lies, the ugly truth
And the day has come where I have died
Only to find I’ve come alive
Come alive, I've come alive

[Bridge]
I wish I wasn't such a narcissist
I wish I didn't really kiss the mirror when I’m on my own
Oh God, I’m gonna die alone!
Adolescence didn’t make sense
A little loss of innocence
The ugly years of being a fool
Ain't youth meant to be beautiful?

[Chorus]
Yeah, I wish I’d been a
Wish I’d been a teen, teen idle
Wish I’d been a prom queen, fighting for the title
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
Feeling super, super (super!) suicidal
The wasted years, the wasted youth
The pretty lies, the ugly truth
And the day has come where I have died
Only to find I’ve come alive
Only to find I’ve come alive
Only to find I’ve come alive

🎙️ Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Yeah, I feel I'm watered down
Whenever he's around
I put on the crown of clowns
And melt slowly to the ground
Yeah, I feel it coming on
When I've been static for too long
And an explosion comes in time
Before I go and cross the line
They say, ""You used to be so kind
I never knew you had such a dirty mind""

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I went to the doctors believing
The devil had control over me, and
I was finding it hard to breathe, and
Finding it hard to fight the feeling

[Chorus]
When my heart just burst like a glass balloon
I let it fly too high and it shattered too soon
I was the wrong damn girl in the wrong damn room
I broke my glass balloon
I let go of my glass balloon

[Post-Chorus]
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh!

[Verse 2]
They call him Hermit the Frog
He's looking for a dog
Did you find your bitch in me?
Oh, you're abominable socially
You're just a little bit too much like me
She says, ""She used to be so kind""
Well, baby, I give you your dirty mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I, I wanna tell you a secret
You can take your double-standard love and keep it
I can't help the devil likes to make my heart a double bed
And I can't help he sometimes likes to come and rest his little head

[Chorus]
When my heart just burst like a glass balloon
I let it fly too high and it shattered too soon
I was the wrong damn girl in the wrong damn room
I broke my glass balloon
I let go of my glass balloon

Oh, my heart just burst like a glass balloon
We let them fly too high and they shatter too soon
Are we the wrong damn people in the wrong damn room?
We broke our glass balloons
We let go of our glass balloons

[Outro]
We broke our glass balloon
Let go of my glass balloon

Kevin Gates is a hip-hop music heavyweight with hits like ""2 Phones"", ""Really Really"", ""Satellites"", ""Out The Mud"", “Posed To Be In Love”, “I Don’t Get Tired” and more. Originally building his name on the back of classic mixtapes such as The Luca Brasi Story, Stranger Than Fiction, By Any Means, Luca Brasi 2, and Murder For Hire II, Kevin's iconic catalog also includes benchmark albums like Islah and I'm Him, which combine his hard-hitting delivery and cinematic storytelling with an emotional honesty and veteran's wisdom. A multi-platinum rapper, singer and entrepreneur, Kevin continues to break new ground with each move, carving out his musical legacy and redefining what it means to be an entertainment mogul.

LYRICS:
I thought by now I'd have it figured out
How not to make the easy thing so hard to do
I bet that I'd be further down this road
If I could read the signs that point me to the truth

I never planned on being nothin' but a cowboy
But somewhere I picked up this old guitar
Girl, all I can say is that I'm sorry
If I get kind of careless with your heart

All the headlights
All the midnights
Chasing all that empty, still ain't got it right
All the crazy
All the gypsy
Well I guess all I'm sayin' is forgive me
If I don't know what I'm doing
I'm still learnin' to be human

So far I've been good at burning bridges
Strike a match and ride right out of town
Bless your heart for never trying to fix me
Or quit me, or slow me down

All the headlights
All the midnights
Chasing all that empty, still ain't got it right
All the crazy
All the gypsy
Well I guess all I'm sayin' is forgive me
If I don't know what I'm doing
I'm still learnin' to be human

All the highways
Playin' outlaw
Rollin' outta nowhere with the breaks off
All the crazy
And the whiskey
Wakin' up and wonderin' what hit me
Whoa, forgive me, I really don't know what I'm doing
'Cause I'm still learning to be human
Mm, still learning to be human

LYRICS:
 
YOU CAN TELL YOUR OLD MAN 
YOU’LL DO SOME LARGE MOUTH FISHIN’ ANOTHER TIME
YOU JUST GOT TOO MUCH ON YOUR PLATE
TO BAIT AND CAST A LINE
YOU CAN ALWAYS PUT THAT A RAINCHECK IN HIS HAND
‘TIL YOU CAN’T
 
YOU CAN KEEP PUTTIN’ OFF FOREVER
WITH THAT GIRL WHO’S HEART YOU HOLD
SWEARIN’ THAT YOU’LL ASK SOMEDAY
FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD
YOU CAN ALWAYS PUT A DIAMOND ON HER HAND
‘TIL YOU CAN’T
 
IF YOU GOT A CHANCE TAKE IT
TAKE IT WHILE YOU GOT A CHANCE
IF YOU GOT A DREAM CHASE IT
‘CAUSE A DREAM WON’T CHASE YOU BACK
IF YOU’RE GONNA LOVE SOMEBODY
HOLD ‘EM AS LONG AND AS STRONG AND AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN
‘TIL YOU CAN’T
 
THERE’S A BOX OF GREASY PARTS
SITTIN’ IN THE TRUNK OF THAT ‘65
STILL WAITIN’ ON YOU AND YOUR GRANDAD
TO BRING IT BACK TO LIFE
YOU CAN ALWAYS GET AROUND
TO FIXIN’ UP THAT PONTIAC
‘TIL YOU CAN’T
 
SO TAKE THAT PHONE CALL FROM YOUR MAMA
AND JUST TALK AWAY
‘CAUSE YOU’LL NEVER KNOW HOW BAD YOU WANNA
‘TIL YOU CAN’T SOMEDAY
DON’T WAIT ON TOMORROW
‘CAUSE TOMORROW MAY NOT SHOW
SAY YOUR SORRY’S
YOUR I LOVE YOU’S
‘CAUSE MAN YOU NEVER KNOW

Breathing fresh Rocky Mountain air into the Nashville music scene, Ian Munsick is pioneering a new brand of country. The Wyoming-born singer / songwriter’s upbringing was a mix of working the ranch and working crowds. Under the tutelage of their fiddle-playing father, Munsick and his two older brothers grew up playing everything from bluegrass to The Beatles. Incorporating elements across genres, he has now begun to establish himself as a progressive artist with an old soul. Captivated by traditional lyrical truth and the modern soundscape, Munsick followed his ear to Music City. In 2017 he released a self-titled EP, winning iHeartRadio’s Rocky Mountain Song of the Year for the rootsy “Horses Are Faster” and becoming the only artist who simultaneously qualified two tracks as finalists in the NSAI/CMT songwriting competition. Since then, Munsick has signed a major label record deal with Warner Music Nashville, earned more than 130 million global streams and been named one of Spotify’s inaugural Hot Country Artists to Watch. His debut album Coyote Cry features his mile-high tenor underscoring self-penned songs that conjure equal parts epic adventure and down-to-earth wisdom. The record marks the dawn of western pop-laced country, pulling a thread straight from Chris LeDoux through Post Malone. Munsick hit the road in the fall alongside labelmate Cody Johnson and his own sold-out, headlining dates. He wrapped the year with his Grand Ole Opry debut and is starting 2022 strong as a MusicRow Next Big Thing artist. Fans are finding that with Ian Munsick, western country is reborn.

LYRICS:
She’s a gooseneck on a dually 
A long neck at the bar 
Loves old John Wayne movies
And walzin’ under them stars 
She’s sun up in the saddle
Cuttin’ through the heard
Loves branding her cattle
Long live cowgirls 

Well she rode in them wagons
When the Wild West was won 
Took the canyons and badlands
And made em her home 
She’s boots on, Ledoux songs
Snaps on her pearls 
Long live cowgirls

Like a paint colored mustang 
She’s fast and she’s wild 
Stop a runaway freight train
With her high country smile
She’s tough as December 
Salt of the earth 
Make ya fall like September 
Long live cowgirls 

Well she rode in them wagons
When the Wild West was won 
Took the canyons and badlands
And made em her home 
She’s boots on, Chris Ledoux songs
Snaps on her pearls 
She’s been there and she’ll be here 
Till the end of the world 
Long live cowgirls

Following the breakout success of his albums Cowboy Like Me and Gotta Be Me, backed by hits “Wild As You"" and ""With You I Am"", Cody ups the ante with his new album Ain’t Nothin’ To It – his first project on the CoJo Music/Warner Music Nashville imprint. Featuring the country radio hit “On My Way To You”, Ain’t Nothin’ To It showcases his full range of talents, brandishing the no-nonsense attitude that Cody brings to his music and passionate, rowdy concerts, which include a sold-out performance in front of 74,177 at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo – giving new fans a taste of what CoJo Nation, Cody’s diehard fan base, have known for years.

仕方ないから、とか、悲しいのは自分だけじゃないから、
などの言葉で到底納得出来るものではありません。
選手達と運営の生徒達に向け、何か出来る事はないかと相談を受けた時、
長い時間自分達の中にあるモヤモヤの正体と、これから何をすべきなのかが分かった気がしました。

先人としてなのか大人としてなのか
野暮な台詞を探してしまいますが、
俺たちはバンドマンなので
慰めでも励ましでも無く音楽を
ここに置いておきます。

清水依与吏（back number）

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

新型コロナウイルス感染拡大は私たちの生活に大きな影響を与え、
back numberとしても心苦しい選択を強いられて来ました。

そんな中、インターハイ（全国高等学校総合体育大会）が史上初めての中止、という決定が下され、
それまで開催に向けて尽力してきた運営を担当する高校生たちからback numberに手紙が届きました。
学生時代に自身も陸上競技でインターハイを目指していた清水依与吏は、
今年のインターハイの開催県が地元・群馬県であったこと、
開会式で「SISTER」が演奏される予定だったことを知り、
何か彼らや彼女たちのために出来ないか考え、急遽制作し、完成した楽曲が『水平線』です。

本来、インターハイの開会式が行われるはずだった、本日8月18日に公開致します。

Lyrics below:
You heard my voice, I came out of the woods by choice
Shelter also gave their shade
But in the dark I have no name
So leave that click in my head
And I will remember the words that you said
Left a clouded mind and a heavy heart
But I am sure we could see a new start
So when your hopes on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road
But hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
I wrestled long with my youth
We tried so hard to live in the truth
But do not tell me all is fine
When I lose my head, I lose my spine
So leave that click in my head
And I won't remember the words that you said
You brought me out from the cold
Now, how I long, how I long to grow old
So when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road
But hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
And I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
The skies I'm under

Lyrics below:
You heard my voice, I came out of the woods by choice
Shelter also gave their shade
But in the dark I have no name
So leave that click in my head
And I will remember the words that you said
Left a clouded mind and a heavy heart
But I am sure we could see a new start
So when your hopes on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road
But hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
I wrestled long with my youth
We tried so hard to live in the truth
But do not tell me all is fine
When I lose my head, I lose my spine
So leave that click in my head
And I won't remember the words that you said
You brought me out from the cold
Now, how I long, how I long to grow old
So when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road
But hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
And I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under

Legend in the game Timmy Trumpet returns to the forefront of the scene with his latest effort 'Blow It Up', in collaboration with Love Harder and vocalist INNA.

The Smash The House regular is back with a bang on this new big room track, in which he lends a hand from Love Harder, a project from the mind of Will Simms, and INNA, a Romanian vocalist. A party anthem that sticks the middle finger up to any unbelievers, Timmy Trumpet expertly produces a jumpy bassline and snappy drum pattern, which would get any raver dancing. Paired with the defiant and carefree lyrics that INNA adeptly delivers, it makes for a catchy, focused, and above all, energetic big room number from one of the scene's top selectors.

LYRICS ✞✞

All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere

And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very very

Mad World, Mad World, Mad World

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher, tell me what's my lesson?
Look right through me, look right through me

All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere

And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very very

Mad World

Children waiting for the day, they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
And I feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher, tell me what's my lesson?
Look right through me, look right through me

Smash The House top dogs Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike unite with label regular Timmy Trumpet and hardstyle icon Brennan Heart on a fresh take on Neil Diamond’s timeless soft-rock ballad ‘Sweet Caroline’.

First releasing in 1969, Neil Diamond’s ‘Sweet Caroline’ has been ever-present and may even have a case at being one of the most iconic pieces of music ever written. Over half a century later, the undisputed anthem is still being remixed and played with – the most recent instalment, from Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Timmy Trumpet and Brennan Heart, energises the classic with the heart and soul of hardstyle. This is a cutting-edge and exciting outlook on the boundaries of music and what can be achieved when you ignore them, a track that will undoubtedly have a sea of people chanting the lyrics at the top of their lungs!

LYRICS OF BLUE EYES
-----------------------------------------------

""Blue Eyes"", hypnotise teri kardi a menu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi mennu, glossy Lips , uff yeah tricks ,Baby lagdi e killer, Oh Yeah Oh Yeah katal kare tera bomb figure.

Blue Eyes, hypnotise teri kardi a menu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi mennu, bomb lagdi mennu,bomb lagdi mennu.

Meri Akhon mein dekha kar jab mein baat karta hu, Mein woh londe nhi jo tere sath padta hu, White Ginni laya hu,Tuje pic karlu, Dekh lunga ashiq or teri teacher nu, Leke chalu ride pe fir chath(roof) kholke, Seedhi baat karu ,na karu tolmol ke, Tonight ,i gotta hold you tight, Aaj hogi late phone karke ghar pe bolde.

Blue Eyes, hypnotise teri kardi a menu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi menu, glossy Lips , uff yeah tricks ,Baby lagdi e killer, Oh Yeah Oh Yeah katal kare tera bomb figure.

Ghar pe chalna hai ya pehle jayegi club, Nhi mera matlab, Ghar ke Club, Tab Lunga left,nahi to right, Club mien hoga shor,baby ghar pe pillow fight You Decide ke kya karna hai, Tujko to jra sa bhi darna hai Champagne ger di hai tune meri pant pe, Kehti hai change karlo hôtel lekar rent pe.

Blue Eyes, hypnotise teri kardi a mennu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi menu, glossy Lips, uff yeah tricks ,Baby lagdi e killer, Oh Yeah Oh Yeah katal kare tera bomb figure.

Suna tere college mein mere gane ban hai, Padne likhne ka tera na koi plan hai, Pass kradu, Phone Ghumadu ,teri Principal bhi baby YO YO ki fan hai, Teri Principal bhi baby YO YO ki fan hai, Kehndi YO YO Honey singh.

Blue Eyes, hypnotise teri kardi a mennu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi mennu, glossy Lips , uff yeah tricks ,Baby lagdi e killer, Oh Yeah Oh Yeah katal kare tera bomb figure.

Blue Eyes, hypnotise teri kardi a mennu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi menu, bomb lagdi menu,bomb lagdi mennu.",True,True,39090098.0,pop rap

Dheere Dheere LYRICS:

Har pal meriyan yadda, yaada vich hai tu,
dil di gaal m dassa te dassa fir kinnu
Har pal meriyan yadda, yaada vich hai tu,
dil di gaal m dassa te dassa fir kinnu
Teri meri, meri teri ek jindri ek jindri what to do, 
Jhoomo main, 
Nachu main,
Main gaoo ki likho, 
tere liye main kya kron.

Dheere Dheere Se Meri Zindagi Mein Aana,
Dheere Dheere Se Dil Ko Churaana.
Tum Se Pyaar Humein hai Kitna Jaane Jaana,
Tumse Milkar Tumko Hai Bataana.

Sham wahi, kaam wahi tere bina ooh sanam,
Neend nahi chain nahi tere bina ooh sanam,
Sham wahi, kaam wahi tere bina ooh sanam,
Neend nahi chain nahi tere bina ooh sanam,
Teri meri, meri teri ek jindri ek jindri what to do, 
Jhoomo main, 
Nachu main,
Main gaoo ki likho, 
tere liye main kya kron.

Dheere Dheere Se Meri Zindagi Mein Aana,
Dheere Dheere Se Dil Ko Churaana.
Tum Se Pyaar Humein hai Kitna Jaane Jaana,
Tumse Milkar Tumko Hai Bataana.

Haaaannn…...
Teri meri story jaise Big Bang theory main sunao chori-chori ye sab ko-sab ko,
Tu mujhse door main yahan pe majboor shikva karoo main ye rab ko-rab ko,
Ek din tum bin beete lagey saal Mera hua bura haal - Mera hua bura haal,
haal kabhi apna mujhe tau batao na aur laut kar wapas kabhi mere pass aaona.

Soota hun, kabhi roota hoon,
tere bina ooh sanam
Paakar sab kuch khota hoon,
tere bina ooh sanam..
Soota hun, kabhi roota hoon,
tere bina ooh sanam
Paakar sab kuch khota hoon,
tere bina ooh sanam..
Teri meri, meri teri ek jindri ek jindri what to do, 
Jhoomo main, 
Nachu main,
Main gaoo ki likho, 
tere liye main kya kron.

Dheere Dheere Se Meri Zindagi Mein Aana,
Dheere Dheere Se Dil Ko Churaana.
Tum Se Pyaar Humein hai Kitna Jaane Jaana,
Tumse Milkar Tumko Hai Bataana.

Manali Trance Lyrics

Badla mizaaj mera phookte hi grass
Grass lage hai mohe sabka ilaaj
Thoda toh main jhoom loon iske nashe mein
C'mon DJ laga de dubstep trance

Oh kaisa lage hai mohe kaise main bataaun
Laage hai sab kuch upside down
Tu bhi kheench do puff
Manali ka hai ye stuff
Tu bhi kheench do puff
Manali ka hai ye stuff
Aah puff, aah.. Stuff
Aah puff, aah.. Stuff
Aah puff, aah.. Stuff
C'mon now, c'mon now
C'mon boy do me **

Rani ni..
Rani mere saath maal phook phook le
Thaamu teri kamar dhuein ke phir ghoont le
Saanson se chadhegi tu kash toh laga le yaari
Dum bole dum ka aa mazaa loot le
Chandan ye badan mat kar tu jatan
Humdum mere sang dori main tu patang
Dum-dum bum-bum kheench mere humdum
Dum ka bum kheenchegi toh
bhoolegi tu saare gham

Dum-dum bum-bum khinch mere humdum
Dum ka bum kheenchegi toh
bhoolegi tu saare gham...

(Aah puff, aah.. Stuff

Dum-dum bum-bum khinch mere humdum
Dum ka bum kheenchegi toh
bhoolegi tu saare gham...

Synopsis:
Shamshera (Ranbir Kapoor) was the leader of Khameran, a warrior tribe who were deceitfully imprisoned and enslaved in the fort of Kaza by the treacherous Shuddh Singh (Sanjay Dutt). Their rebellious leader, Shamshera, tried to escape the fort to earn the price of his tribe’s freedom but was unsuccessful.

Twenty-five years later, Shamshera’s son Balli (Ranbir Kapoor), blissfully unaware of his past, had grown up aspiring to be a police officer. He was the leader of a gang of kids, teaching them to steal petty things he collected to gift his lover, Sona (Vaani Kapoor). Balli and Sona shared an innocent, platonic relationship. One fateful day Balli was punished mercilessly by Shuddh Singh for wanting to be an officer. Finally, his distraught mother revealed the secret of their dark past. An agitated Balli rebelled and escaped the fort. 

Balli then began the adventurous journey to the outside world, where many of his father’s old confidants awaited the arrival of the next Shamshera. With the help of them and Sona, they started looting the arrogant upper caste of Kaza to accumulate the price of their tribe’s freedom. As matters worsen, the British government assigned an officer, Freddy Young, to deal with the case. Freddy was a fierce and loyal officer yet a compassionate man. As he digs deeper into the history of the Khameran tribe, he realises the actual cause of their fight. 

In the meantime, Balli and the gang continue to accumulate the gold required for their freedom. But things did not go as planned. Lost and distraught, only one option remains with Balli. He must prove his worth to be the true Shamshera who can win the freedom of his people back.

Bang Bang Lyrics

Teri meri.. raaton ne kiye hain kuch iraade
Milli hai jo ab ye mulaqaatein
Koi jaadu hone ko hai (hone ko hai..)

Teri meri.. hui aankhon-aankhon mein jo baatein
Mili hai jo ab ye mulaqaatein
Koi jaadu hone ko hai

Hona hai.. jo hona hai rahega hoke hi
Hota hai.. jo mill jata hai koyi
Hoga yeh.. hai jaana maine milke tumse hi
Are you feeling it tonight
I am feeling it tonight
Bang Bang, raat bhar baat kar
Tu mere saath chal 
Dil pe chala hai jaadu, jaane kyun..

Bang bang raat bhar baat kar
Tu mere saath chal
Dil pe chala hai jaadu, jaane kyun

Bang Bang, Bang Bang, Bang Bang
Jaane kyun...
Bang Bang, Bang Bang, Bang Bang
Jaane kyun... Bang Bang!

Hey! aajkal aate jaate
Hey! aankhe karti hai baatein
Hey! aaj toh aa jaana hai
Hey! aankhon ki baaton mein
Bas ek baat kar le
Hey! mujhe baahon mein tu bhar le
Hey! aur saari raat bhar yeh
Hey! chalti rahe phir kahani teri meri

Teri meri.. teri meri aahon ke ishaare
Aa zara samajh le hum woh saare
Ke hosh ab toh khone ko hain (khone ko hain)

Teri meri.. teri meri
Raaton ne kiye hain kuch iraade
Mili hain jo ab yeh mulaqaatein 
Koi jaadu hone ko hai (hone ko hai)

Hona hai.. jo hona hai rahega hoke hi
Hota hai.. jo mill jata hai koyi
Hoga yeh.. hai jaana maine milke tumse hi
Are you feeling it tonight
I am feeling it tonight

Bang bang.. raat bhar baat kar
Tu mere saath chal
Dil pe chala hai jaadu, jaane kyun?

Bang Bang.. raat bhar baat kar
Tu mere saath chal
Dil pe chala hai jaadu, jaane kyun

Bang bang, Bang bang, Bang bang
Jaane kyun..
Bang bang, Bang bang, Bang bang
Jaane kyun..

Raat bhar baat kar..
Jaane kyun.. bang Bang
Raat bhar baat kar
Dil pe chala hai jaadu, jaane kyun..

Take a little dance dance

Lyrics:
At night I travel
My nerves unravel
It hurts to hide myself from you

With care I held it
Inside I felt it
My favorite pain comes back to me

Don't break me
Don't let go
Don't try to leave
Let your habits control you

These blades I'm hiding
Keep safe the tidings
Of bridges crossed that soon collapsed

No fear of falling
Endlessly calling
You make me feel like I'm alone

Don't break me
Don't let go
Don't try to leave
Let your habits control you

Take me alive
Leave me to die
Bound to the earth
This isn't goodbye

Cut through the heart
Mangle my veins
Till I'm no more
Teach me these pains

I need you to fight me

I need you to destroy me

I wouldn't hide
Lay on the ground

Lyrics:
When we first met / i fell apart
You carved the words / inside my heart
It hurts to breathe / when I’m alone
It hurts to be / unknown

We’ve got our own grave / with both names / It’s do or die
I can’t hear you / but I can feel you / you’re by my side
To feel the time move / the hues that paint you / you can’t hide
We’ve got our own grave / with both names / it’s you and I

Somehow, somewhere / it’s in the air
I’m in your arms / I’m in your care
Across the floor / our hearts are strewn
Exchanging touch / my wounds are sewn

We’ve got our own grave / with both names / It’s do or die
I can’t hear you / but I can feel you / you’re by my side
To feel the time move / the hues that paint you / you can’t hide
We’ve got our own grave / with both names / it’s you and I

Every night / I try to reach you / There's never a reply
If there's a way / I can see you / I am ready to die

We’ve got our own grave / with both names / It’s do or die
(It’s do or die)
I can’t hear you / but I can feel you / you’re by my side
(you’re by my side)
To feel the time move / the hues that paint you / you can’t hide
(you can’t hide)

Lyrics:
(Of all the times, the chances I have given you, you let me down)

On the first / I won’t forget
The way you said / he took his life
And left the line dead

How do you think / selfishly
You made me hurt so vacantly

You let me down / and I know it’s all because of me

The choice that led / to giving up
But never know why

A hollow void / You keep me there
I’ll drown in tears until you care

Lyrics:
To all my friends / I got a blade
A sedative / The rope tied
Thanks for everything / from the love below
Put my finger on the trigger and I’ll let it go

Electricity /at my fingertips
A gas leak / in case that I forget
I’ve got all I need / to get me out of here
Leave me be with my remorse and I will disappear

I want to hurt myself / i want to hurt myself
I want I want I want to hurt myself / I want to hurt myself

Hurry up / take me today
It always ends / the same way
My head won’t clear / when I lose control
Please don’t wake me up if I become comatose

Does it hurt / if you know
That I’m not here / you’ll be alone
I surrender now / I won’t leave a note
Let me jump, let me shoot, let me overdose

I want to hurt myself / i want to hurt myself
I want I want I want to hurt myself / I want to hurt myself

Let me jump, let me shoot, let me overdose (x4)",False,False,3736298.0,synth-pop

Lyrics:
In my time alone
I died a million deaths
A gaze into the glass
To memories I have kept
They show me who I’ve been
The people I have hurt
I lay myself to sleep
My power will emerge

Don’t you ever cry for me
You could never tell me you’re sorry
Get me far away from here (From liquid I’m drowning)
As my body leaves a void
Fill it up with memories that I’ve destroyed
Burden me with hate and love (From liquid I’m choking)

I used to have a heart
With pain I never felt
I tried to fall apart
For damage I have dealt
Through the broken glass
My kingdom underneath
The mirror looking back
A monster made of me

Don’t you ever cry for me
You could never tell me you’re sorry
Get me far away from here (From liquid I’m drowning)
As my body leaves a void
Fill it up with memories that I’ve destroyed
Burden me with hate and love (From liquid I’m choking)

Get me out of here (x4)

Lyrics:

I bust the windows out your car
And no it didn't mend my broken heart
I'll probably always have these ugly scars
But right now I don't care about that part
I bust the windows out your car
After I saw you laying next to her
I didn't wanna but I took my turn
I'm glad I did it cause you had to learn

I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you'll see what happens when
You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile

Lyrics

I tell myself you don't mean a thing,
And what we got, got no hold on me
But when you're not there I just crumble
I tell myself I don't care that much,
But I feel like I die 'til I feel your touch,

Only love, only love can hurt like this,
Only love can hurt like this
Must have been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this

Say I wouldn't care if you walked away,
But every time you're there I'm begging you to stay,
And when you come close I just tremble
And every time, every time you go,
It's like a knife that cuts right to my soul

Only love, only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this,
Must have been a deadly kiss,
Only love can hurt like this,
Only love can hurt like this

Your kisses burn into my skin,
Only love can hurt like this
But it's the sweetest pain,
Burning hot through my veins,
Love is torture makes me more sure
Only love can hurt like this

Only love can hurt like this,
Only love can hurt like this,
Must have been a deadly kiss,
Only love can hurt like this,

Only love can hurt like this,
Your kisses burn into my skin,
Only love can hurt like this,
Only love can hurt like this,
Only love can hurt like this,
Only love can hurt
Save me, save me,
Only love, only love,
'Cause only love can hurt like this
And it must have been a deadly kiss",True,True,472628386.0,soft rock

Lyrics
Angels watching over me with smiles upon their face
Coz I have made it through this far in an unforgiving place

It feels sometimes this hill's too steep for a girl like me to climb
But I must knock those thoughts right down I'll do it in my own time

I don't care (care care)
I'm halfway there (nowhere)
On a road that leads me straight to who knows where

I tell you what (I tell you what)
What I have found (What I have found)
That I'm no fool (That I'm no fool)
I'm just upside down (Just upside down)

Ain't got no cares (Ain't got no cares)
I ain't got no rules (Ain't got no rules)
I think I like (I think I like)
Living upside down (Living upside down)

Watching people scurry by rushing to and fro
Oh this world is such a crazy place it's all about the go go go

Sometimes life can taste so sweet
When you slow it down
You start to see the world a little differently
When you turn it upside down

I don't care (care care)
I'm half way there (nowhere)
And I'm just soaking up the magic in the air

I tell you what (I tell you what)
What I have found (What I have found)
That I'm no fool (That I'm no fool)
I'm just upside down (Just upside down)

Ain't got no cares (Ain't got no cares)
I ain't got no rules (Ain't got no rules)
I think I like (I think I like)
Living upside down (Living upside down)

(Whoa Whoa Whoa)
You gotta slow it down
(Yeah Yeah Yeah)
But then you pick it up
(Whoa Yeah Whoa)
C'mon and try a little topsy-turvy back-to-front the right way round
Take it slow slow slow (You gotta pick it up)
Yeah Yeah Yeah (See you slow it down)
Yo Yo Yo (Tell me something something)

I tell you what (I tell you what)
What I have found (What I have found)
That I'm no fool (That I'm no fool)
I'm just upside down (Just upside down)

Ain't got no cares (Ain't got no cares)
I ain't got no rules (Ain't got no rules)
I think I like (I think I like)
Living upside down (Living upside down)

I tell you what (I tell you what)
What I have found (What I have found)
That I'm no fool (That I'm no fool)
I'm just upside down (Just upside down)

Ain't got no cares (Ain't got no cares)
I ain't got no rules (Ain't got no rules)
I think I like (I think I like)

Lyrics
Will you lay me down 
Make our hearts the only sound
Throw my fears all to the ground
Will you hold me

Will you serenade me
With the song you used to play
Til the night turns into day
Will you hold me 

Cause all I need is somebody near me
When my heart gets weak
Somebody out there watching over me
When I’m so tired, I can’t even sleep

Won’t you sing me your sweet lullaby
Just the sound of your voice
Is the thing that I need
Won’t you sing me your sweet lullaby
I could fall for the sound of your sweet melody

Cause I just need your song
Something to sing a long 
When I’m not feeling strong I need you
To sing me your sweet lullaby
Need the sound of your sweet melody
So sing to me

So Sing to me
Need the sound of your sweet melody
So Sing to me

Ill be there when you’re down
Cause forever I am bound 
For my love I shout it out
Let me hold you
No journey is too far 
For the one who healed my scars
You’re my saviour, you’re my star
Let me hold you

Cause all I need is somebody near me
When my heart gets weak
Somebody out there watching over me
When I’m so tired, I can’t even sleep

Won’t you sing me your sweet lullaby
Just the sound of your voice
Is the thing that I need
Won’t you sing me your sweet lullaby
I could fall for the sound of your sweet melody
So Sing to me

When I’m not sleeping 
You’re all I need and
When my heart stops beating
Just sing to me
When I’m not sleeping 
You’re all I need and
When my heart stops beating
Just sing to me
When I’m not sleeping 
You’re all I need and
Just sing, sing to me
Can’t you please sing to me
Won’t you sing me your sweet lullaby
Just the sound of your voice
Is the thing that I need
Won’t you sing me your sweet lullaby
I could fall for the sound of your sweet melody

Cause I just need your song
Something to sing along 
When I’m not feeling strong, I need you
To sing me your sweet lullaby
Need the sound of your sweet melody

Lyrics: 

[Popcaan]
You don’t need to run away,
stay right next to me
You don’t need to run away,
stay right next to me,
stay right next to me
[Toni-Ann]
You make me wanna run, run, run
Heartbeat racing like a drum, drum, drum
Feel it in my soul,
Leave me wanting more
Yea, you make me wanna run, run, run
Heartbeat racing like a drum, drum, drum
Don’t know where we’ll go,
Don’t know where we’ll go

[Popcaan x Toni-Ann]
Yea,
You don’t need to run away,
stay right next to me,
stay right next to me
But if you wanna go, I will go
if you wanna go, I will go
But if you wanna go, I will go
Just stay right next to me
[Popcaan]
We could go anywhere
Anywhere you choose
Take you on a cruise
Girl you are so beautiful
Love to see you smiling,
The love we have is never ending
Tell me how you feeling

[Toni-Ann]
You make me wanna run, run, run
Heartbeat racing like a drum, drum, drum
Feel it in my soul,
Leave me wanting more
Yea, you make me wanna run, run, run
Heartbeat racing like a drum, drum, drum
Don’t know where we’ll go,
Don’t know where we’ll go

Yea,

But if you wanna go, I will go
Just stay right next to me

[Toni-Ann Singh]
Ah, oh,
Met a few lifetimes ago
You were Anthony , I was Cleo
Made the world a place only we know
If it’s not love then tell me what’s this feeling you giving me
If it’s not love then I’m begging you baby to leave me
I shoulda never let it show
can see it in your eyes you know
Can see it in your eyes you know

[Toni-Ann]
You make me wanna run, run, run
Heartbeat racing like a drum, drum, drum
Feel it in my soul,
Leave me wanting more
Yea, you make me wanna run, run, run
Heartbeat racing like a drum, drum, drum
Don’t know where we’ll go,
Don’t know where we’ll go

[Popcaan x Toni-Ann]
Yea,

Lyrics:

Tell me what I did this time
Why is it I work so hard for you
I wish I could read your mind
I don’t know if you want me to come over

I don’t know if you want me to come over
I don’t wanna ask really I should know better
I don’t know if you want me to come over

This is something that I’m used to
I give too much but I choose to and you love that
You love that
I don’t know what you have been through but
I’ve worked too hard not to lose you and you know that

Tell me what I did this time
Why is it I work so hard for you
I wish I could read your mind
I don’t know if you want me to come over

I don’t know if you want me to come over
I don’t wanna ask really I should know better
I don’t know if you want me to come over

Wish I knew what’s on your mind
Then I wouldn’t think it’s something I’ve done if you gave more of your time
Then we both might just get what we want
Are you too scared to love me

Tell me what I did this time
Why is it I work so hard for you
I wish I could read your mind
I don’t know if you want me to come over

I don’t know if you want me to come over
I don’t wanna ask really I should know better
I don’t know if you want me to come over

Popcaan Verse:

You should, you would know
Marry you like Bruno Mars
Late night FaceTime call
Can’t work at the studio
It’s been a while mi see you whine
It’s been a while you smile
You getting pretty
Ah you pretty from you juvenile
Whine up your body gyal
You fit you can go a couple mile
You have a bad attitude
Sometime you act recoil

This is something that I’m used to
I give too much but I choose to and you love that
You love that I don’t know what you have been through but
I’ve worked too hard not to lose you and you know that

I don’t know if you want me to come over
I don’t wanna ask really I should know better
I don’t know if you want me to come over

I don’t know if you want me to come over
I don’t wanna ask really I should know better
I don’t know if you want me to come over",True,True,64120942.0,dancehall
