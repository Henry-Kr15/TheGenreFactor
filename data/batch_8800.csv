Lyrics: 
[Verse 1]
Won't you please let me go
These words lie inside, they hurt me so
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what I want to do
I'm not the kind that needs to tell you
Just what you want me to

[Verse 2]
I saw you this morning
I thought that you might like to know
I received your message in full a few days ago
I understood every word that it said
And now that I've actually heard it
You're going to regret

[Verse 3]
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what you want me to
You're not the kind that needs to tell me
About the birds and the bees

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Do you find this happens all the time
Crucial point one day becomes a crime
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what I want to do
I'm not the kind that needs to tell you

[Outro]
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you

New Order's 'Regret', which was the first single off of New Order's 1993 album 'Republic' 


Lyrics

Maybe I've forgotten
The name and the address
Of everyone I've ever known,
It's nothing I regret
Save it for another day, 'cause
The school is out 
And the kids have run away
I would like a place I can call my own
Have a conversation on my telephone
Wake up everyday, that would be a start
I would not complain 'bout my wounded heart
I was upset, you see
Almost all the time
You used to be a stranger
Now you are mine
I wouldn't even trust you
I've not that much to give
We're dealing in the limits, 
And we don't know who with
You may think that I'm out of hand
That I'm naive, I'll understand
On this occasion, it's not true
Look at me, I'm not you
I would like a place I can call my own
Have a conversation on the telephone
Wake up everyday, that would be a start
I would not complain 'bout my wounded heart
I was a short fuse
Burning all the time
You were a complete stranger
Now you are mine
I would like a place I can call my own
Have a conversation on the telephone
Wake up everyday, that would be a start
I would not complain 'bout my wounded heart
Just wait 'till tomorrow
I guess that's what they all say
Just before they fall apart

""True Faith"" is a song by New Order, co-produced by Stephen Hague.


Lyrics

I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty
I don't care 'cause I'm not there
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun
When I was a very small boy
Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
And the value of destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there was just no way of knowing
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun
I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty
The chances are we've gone too far
You took my time and you took my money
Now I fear you've left me standing
In a world that's so demanding
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun

Lyrics

Heaven, a gateway, a hope
Just like a feeling inside, it's no joke
And though it hurts me to see you this way
Betrayed by words, I'd never heard, too hard to say
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home
Each way I turn, I know I'll always try
To break this circle that's been placed around me
From time to time, I find I've lost some need
That was urgent to myself, I do believe
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home
Oh, you've got green eyes
Oh, you've got blue eyes
Oh, you've got grey eyes
Oh, you've got green eyes
Oh, you've got blue eyes
Oh, you've got grey eyes
And I've never seen anyone quite like you before
No, I've never met anyone quite like you before
Bolts from above hurt the people down below
People in this world, we have no place to go
Bolts from above hurt the people down below
People in this world, we have no place to go
Bolts from above hurt the people down below
People in this world, we have no place to go
Bolts from above hurt the people down below
People in this world, we have no place to go
Oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time
Oh, I've never met anyone quite like you before
Oh no, I've never met anyone quite like you before

Letra:
Los besos de mi boca no fueron suficientes 
Para que te quedaras conmigo para siempre 
No me alcanzo el cariño para verte contenta 
Te amaba como un loco y no te diste cuenta... 

Me resultaron falsas toditas tus palabras 
Tus manos me mentían cuando me acariciaban 
De que sirvió rogarte para que te quedaras 
Mi error fue darte todo cuando no vales nada... 

Me vas a extrañarte apuesto lo que quieras 
Que vas a buscarme y vas a llorar 
Porque tú a mi jamás supiste valorarme 
Te vas a acordar de todas nuestras travesuras 
Pero será muy tarde... 

Me vas a extrañar porque un amor como este 
No fácil se olvida y nadie sabrá 
Hacerte todas las cosas que yo a ti te hacia 
Pero fue un error entregar mi corazón 
a quien no lo merecía...

Me vas a extrañarte apuesto lo que quieras 
Que vas a buscarme y vas a llorar 
Porque tú a mi jamás supiste valorarme 
Te vas a acordar de todas nuestras travesuras 
Pero será muy tarde...

No fácil se olvida y nadie sabrá 
Hacerte todas las cosas que yo a ti te hacia 
Pero fue un error entregar mi corazón

Perrito Malvado 
El perrito se fue de casa 
en pleno brillar de la luna 
por que había una perra alzada 
que quería que pinte alguna 
APD 
perrito malvado 
agarras caravana
volves re mamado 
El perrito se fue de casa
en pleno brillar de la luna 
por que había una perra alzada 
que quería que pinte alguna
Lo vieron darse la fuga por las vías
se notaba que arrancaba ya la gira
las calles del barrio ya lo conocían 
se sabia que mañana no volvía
Mi perrito malvado
ay no seas así
Te suelto la correa 
y te me queres ir 
Y si me sueltan la correa 
yo arranco pa la perrera 
donde están todas las perras 
que mas mueven su cadera
este ritmo suavecito para que baile despacito 
yo me tiro este pasito
mientras enrolo ese fasito
Meta cumbia pisando barro
todas las negra moviendo el tarro
puro traqueteo pistolero
vos sabes que soy cumbiero 
siempre al ritmo ATR KeloKe

Tengo muchas fotos de nosotros
Pero ya nosotros dos
No es como siempre que peleamos hoy y volvemos mañana
Y ahora cuando tengas frÍo
No vas a encontrar el calor
Jamás se llenará el vacío
Así como lo hiciste vos
Oh oh …oh oh

Decime la verdad si me queres
Porque me hiciste tanto daño
Para que sepas ya estoy bien
Y no te perdono en mil años
Te quisiera ver la cara cuando pases las esquinas donde alguna vez nos vimos
Y llores…y llores...
donde alguna vez nos reímos 
Todas las cosas que te enseñe
Olvidarla no vas a poder
Porque yo si que me enamore
Pero con vos no compre
Tomando vino en cartón
Para matar la calor
No estoy llorando y vos

ME MUERO DE AMOR (Letra)
Desde que te vi me enamore de ti
No puedo dejar de pensar
No puedo dejar de sonar contigo
Me muero de amor
Desde que te vi, yo enloquecí y muero por vos
Me muero de amor
Extraño tu risa, tu dulce caricia que me enloqueció
Como olvidar aquellas noches de hotel
Donde mis manos acariciaban tu piel
Y mi boca besaba tu cuerpo
Nos amamos hasta quedar sin aliento
Quiero volverte a ver, en ese cuarto de hotel
Me muero de amor
Desde que te vi, yo enloquecí y muero por vos
Me muero de amor
Extraño tu risa, tu dulce caricia que me enloqueció
Como olvidar aquellas noches de hotel
Donde mis manos acariciaban tu piel
Y mi boca besaba tu cuerpo
Nos amamos hasta quedar sin aliento
Quiero volverte a ver, en ese cuarto de hotel
Como olvidar aquellas noches de hotel
Donde mis manos acariciaban tu piel
Y mi boca besaba tu cuerpo
Nos amamos hasta quedar sin aliento
Quiero volverte a ver, en ese cuarto de hotel
Me muero de amor, me muero por vos

Si te vas, pondré una flor en un jarrón por ti
Me perderé con tu recuerdo hasta encontrar
Algún amigo a quien hablarle de ti.
Si te vas, no me preguntes si te ame o no

Letra / Lyrics: 

Dame lo que esconde tu mirada
y te doy el lado izquierdo de mi pecho
dame lo que se te de la gana
a tus pies el mundo entero por un beso

Te regalo toda la luz de la luna
mi pasado, mi fortuna,
mi futuro, mi razón

Esta noche no la cambio por ninguna
si la vida es solo una
contigo sabe mejor

Dame el universo de tu cama
y te doy mi vida entera y mucho mas
dame alguna de tus madrugadas
y te doy mi corazón por la mitad

Te regalo toda la luz de la luna
mi pasado, mi fortuna
mi futuro, mi razón

Esta noche no la cambio por ninguna
si la vida es solo una
contigo sabe mejor

Dame una esperanza
dame noches que no acaban
un beso robado
un pecado, una canción

Y no digas nada
se mi luz de madrugada
mis latidos, mis sentidos
mi respiración.

LETRA

Justo cuando sale del hueco
en el que tu me dejaste con la luz pagada
Cuando había empezado algo nuevo
la pantalla me muestra tu maldita llamada
 
Me dices que me extrañas
Pero yo me se tus mañas
Me llamas cuando estas jodida
 
Tu vida es un enredo
Y yo no quiero ni puedo
Volver a ser tu salvavidas
 
Oye querida,
Estas perdida
La ultima ya fue la despedida
Oye querida,
Sigue tu vida
Que bastante me costó arreglar la mia
 
Yo se que te parece extraño
que tus ojos rojos ya no me hacen daño
Y mira, querida,
Las vueltas que nos da la vida
Y mira, querida,
Que ya no soy tu salvavidas
 
Me dices que recuerde lo bueno
Pero yo ya no puedo porque tu lo borraste
Esta flor se marchitó,
Este cuento se acabó,
Se te olvida que tu lo acabaste
Me dices que me extrañas
Pero ya me se tus mañas
Me llamas cuando estas jodida
Tu vida es un enredo
Y yo no quiero ni puedo
Volver a ser tu salvavidas
Oye querida,
Estas perdida
La ultima ya fue la despedida
Oye querida,
Sigue tu vida
Que bastante me costó arreglar la mia
Yo se que te parece extraño
que tus ojos rojos ya no me hacen daño
Y mira, querida,
Las vueltas que nos da la vida
Y mira, querida,
Que ya no soy tu salvavidas
La ultima ya fue la despedida
Tu sigue con tu vida y yo la mía
Me dices que me extrañas y ya me se tus mañas
Llamas cuando estas jodida
Tu vida es un enredo y yo no quiero ni puedo
Ser tu salvavidas
Oye querida,
Estas perdida
La ultima ya fue la despedida
Oye querida,
Sigue tu vida
Que bastante me costó arreglar la mia
Yo se que te parece extraño
que tus ojos rojos ya no me hacen daño
Y mira, querida,
Las vueltas que nos da la vida
Y mira, querida,
Que ya no soy tu salvavidas

The song first appeared on Bread's 1970 album On the Waters. Released as a single in June 1970, it would become the group's first top ten and only number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in the U.S., spending the week of August 22, 1970, at the top spot.

The single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. It was also certified gold by the RIAA for sales of over one million copies.

The song was well received by easy-listening stations at the beginning of the singer-songwriter driven soft rock era, reaching number four on the Billboard Easy Listening Top 40. The Supremes, Aretha Franklin, Earth, Wind & Fire, Dusty Springfield, Cilla Black, The Originals, The Main Ingredient, The Whispers, Marc Anthony, Teddy Pendergrass, Don Julian & The Larks, Let Loose, Dennis Brown, Andy Williams, Lou Donaldson, Tony Mottola, and Marc Cohn are amongst those who have recorded cover versions of the song.

It has also been recorded in other languages including Spanish, as ""Quiero Hacerte El Amor"" with a version by Blvd featuring M C Blvd being popular on the West Coast. Ralfi Pagan reached number 32 on the Billboard R&B chart during an eleven week run in the summer of 1971 with a Latin-soul version of the song, and also by Puerto Rican-American Spanish R&B group Barrio Boyzz in 1993 as ""Cerca de Ti"" (Close to You)",False,False,138537140.0,rock music

Ummmm

Back of the couple 
You know what to do 
Keep your hands on me
Pure Ecstasy 
Dirty Sprite
Open doors
Just For you 

I know you like her too 
Just like I do 
This point of view 
Is something new for you 

Ooooo 

Girl I don’t really want to think this through 
Just keep on doing what you’re doing

Ooooo

Girl I know you like how I do ya

V2 

The stars are aligned
What a hell of a night
I’m pulling her hair
I’m glad that you came
It’s OK to share
Oh baby you’re something else
So don’t be jealous of your own reflection
Baby I know I know I know

You like her too 
Just like I do 
This point of view 
Is something 
I know you like her too

Oh, oh

We met somewhere in a dream
Tossin', turnin'
Can't get no sleep

[Pre-Chorus: Mario]
Slow down, feel the rush
Turn love into lust
Baby, one night ain't enough

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Mario]
Gotta get back to your body (Your body, babe)
When I close my eyes, I feel you wrapped around me
I need it, need it (Oh)
Gotta get back to your body, yeah (Oh)
Girl, you're flawless like the diamonds in my tongue piercin' (Yeah)
Gotta get back

[Verse 2: Mario, Chris Brown]
Your complexion's iridescent, it's so magical
You're so colorful
Baby, you know what I want
It's you
It ain't enough for me to beg, tell me
Somethin' I can do instead, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Mario]
Slow down, feel the rush
Turn love into us
Baby, one night ain't enough

[Chorus: Mario, Chris Brown]
Gotta get back
To your body (Your body, babe)

So icy, girl

[Verse 3: Chris Brown, Mario]
Girl, ride
Ain't no point in tellin' you to stop (Stop it)
Sayin' that you're scared, I know you're not (Know you're not, babe)
Send your location, gon' and drop it
Pull up and then you pop it
Got 'em outside
I pull up and then I pop between your thighs
In the dark, I seen the look up in your eyes
When you with me, nobody else around
Ain't gotta speak on it, we fuck around
No, this ain't a little mix-up (No, huh)
This ain't a one night stand with me
You know I can't forget her

[Chorus: Mario, Chris Brown, Both]
Gotta get back
To your body, yeah (Your body, babe)
When I close my eyes, I feel you wrapped around me
I need it, need it (Oh, no)
Gotta get back to your body, yeah (Baby)
'Cause you're flawless like the diamonds in my tongue piercin' (Yeah)
Gotta get back
So icy, girl

[Outro: Mario, Chris Brown, Both]
Ooh, yeah
Gotta get back to your body, baby
Gotta get back to your body, yeah
Gotta get back
Around me, oh

Lyrics:

Ladies and gentlemen
Kelly's back

Told you all I was gonna bump like this
You all didn't think that I could bump like this
Said I told you all I was gonna bump like this (uh-uh)
Turn around then I make it jump like this (Ladies)
You wanna keep that boy that make it jump like this
You all didn't think that I could make it bump like this
See I told you all you all was gonna jump like this
How you not gonna know it when it hits like this

Ladies, drama, leave it - home
If he ain't got it right by now scratch him - off
They just called me
Said it's about - twenty strong
They standing at the door don't wanna take us - on
The ring let it go 'bout three months ago
The pain the stressin'
Ain't in me no more
The girl that they used to know - done changed
Now they sayin' Ms. before they mention my name",True,True,60071333.0,hip hop music

Lyrics:

He was always such a nice boy
The quiet one 
With good intentions
He was down for his brother
Respectful to his mother
A good boy
But good don't get attention
One kid with a promise
The brightest kid in school
He's not a fool
Reading books about science and smart stuff
It's not enough, no
Cause smart don't make you cool, whoa

He's not invisible anymore
With his Father's 9 and a broken fuse
Since he walked through that classroom door
He's all over primetime news

Mary's got the same size hands 
As Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints
At Manns Chinese Theater Show
She coulda been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole 
Now we'll never know",True,True,22715322.0,contemporary R&B

Lyrics:
Coffee & sex in the morning
Breakfast in bed, got me moanin
Before you go to work
(I need you to go to work)
Pardon my sincerity
You know I’m a rare-ity
My love be your therapy
All around remedy
Baby, who instead of me
These ******s will neva be
Put it down like it’s heavy baby
Honeymoon that,
Wedding Day that!

I need that wake up
Soon as we wake up
Wish we could lay up
Still stack our pay up
You running late but
Need you to stay up
It’s almost 8
No time to waste
No time to waste

And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns weh nuh know 'bout variety
Boom!

The youngest veteran a go murder dem slow
Ragga muffin sent to call me from the bush bungalow
Unnu watch mek I clear out my voice now Figaro!
Emerge from the darkness with mi big blunt a glow
Mi hammer dem a slam and spectator get low
Some bwoy coulda big like Bam Bam Biggalow
Bust of trigger finger, trigger hand and trigger toe
A two gun mi have mi bust dem inna stereo

[Nas]
Sometimes I can't help but feel helpless 
I'm havin daymares in daytime 
Wide awake try to relate 
This can't be happenin like I'm in a dream while I'm walkin 
Cause what I'm seein is haunting
Human beings like ghost and zombies
President Mugabe holding guns to innocent bodies
In Zimbabwe
They make John Pope seem Godly
Sacrilegious and blasphemous

In my lifetime I look back at paths i've walked
Where savages fought and pastors taught 
Prostitutes stomp in high heel boots 
And badges screaming,""Young black children stop or I will shoot!""
I look back at cooked crack 
Plus cars that pass by
Jaguars mad fly
And I'm guilty for materialism 
Blacks is still up in the prison Trust that 
So save me your sorries, I'm raising an army 
Revolutionary warfare with Damian Marley 
We sparkin' the ions, marching to Zion 
You know how Nas be NYC state of mind I'm in

""Living It Up"" Lyrics:
My daddy made it out!
Out of the ghetto
Believe in your dreams, believe you me 
Don’t let go
We’re living it up!
We’re having a good time baby
I was born uptown
I’m the ghetto dream
Now ain’t life crazy?
My daddy made it out!
Out of the ghetto
Believe in your dreams, believe you me 
Don’t let go
We’re living it up!
We’re having a good time baby
I was born uptown
I’m the ghetto dream
Now don’t be lazy

Trench Town have a grandson 
Growing up to be somebody 
Gong to the Zilly
Yo mi flow phenomenally
I am the kind of thing that doesn’t happen normally 
I’m a one in a zillion
Yo Doggy if you want some
Good life finally
Perhaps change your night time hobby 
Come out of the old crime lobby
And benefit from your wisdom
Mi a gwan live it up life is better than great
Every other day mi voice a dozen dub plate
Put in our hustle we nuh sit down and wait
Tuff up unnu muscle now is never too late
Fi gwan celebrate inna rich people place
The little Rasta Man from Trench Town fly the gate 
With food inna plate and drinks inna crate
We sing till the neighbor dem wake

My daddy made it out!
Out of the ghetto
Believe in your dreams, believe you me 
Don’t let go
We’re living it up!
We’re having a good time baby
I was born uptown
I’m the ghetto dream
Now ain’t life crazy?
My daddy made it out!
Out of the ghetto
Believe in your dreams, believe you me 
Don’t let go
We’re living it up!
We’re having a good time baby
I was born uptown
I’m the ghetto dream
Now don’t be lazy

Uptown Jamaica born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days 
Burning Babylon and dem dirty ways
While watching all the rich kids gone a stay
Uptown Jamaica born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days 
Big city life Kingston and Mo-Bay
And if you think mi sell out tell dem ain’t no way 
So... Live it up Trench Town to Rema
Riverton, South Side to Jungle
Sherlock, Garden, to Spangler’s,
Payne Land, Three Mile to Back-to,
Portmore, Seaview, Spanish Town,
Nine Mile, Browns Town to Flankers,
Falmouth, West Side, Orange Hill

My daddy made it out!
Out of the ghetto
Believe in your dreams, believe you me 
Don’t let go
We’re living it up!
We’re having a good time baby
I was born uptown
I’m the ghetto dream
Now ain’t life crazy?
My daddy made it out!
Out of the ghetto
Believe in your dreams, believe you me 
Don’t let go
We’re living it up!
We’re having a good time baby
I was born uptown
I’m the ghetto dream
Now don’t be lazy

""Pimpa's Paradise""
(feat. Stephen Marley, Black Thought)

[Black Thought Speaking]
And yes y'all, you now rocking with the best
Black Thought from the legendary Roots crew in the flesh
I split up in here with the brothers from the Marley family
Creston--we gon' say it for y'all

[Stephen Marley]
She loves to party, have a good time
She looks so hearty, feeling fine
She loves to smoke, sometimes shifting coke
Hey...she'd be laughing when there ain't no joke

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was

[Verse 1]
Cause coke was a thing that once she first try
Was once a blue moon to once a blue sky
Now she's wondering who else wants to go buy
She don't got no money and wants to get high
Story sounds familiar,
Like born to be wild but she sillier
Not quite the same, but she similar
A waste of my sarsaparilla
Used to look good in the videos, now she look hideous

Now it's broken crack pipes with lipstick traces
Walks the cold nights red district places
She seen more hotels than my tour suitcases
More male customers than Old Navy's
She love lime light more than John Swaby's
Seen more miles than a Rent-A-Avis
She don't slow down then someday maybe
She lost and can't find her way to safety

[Chorus Repeats]

[Black Thought]
Check it out
She keep her head up in the space like a satellite
Because she got an insatiable appetite
For staying out late nights with all the parasites
Plotting on a way to cop a little piece of paradise
Her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice
Just get the monkey off her back and she'd be back in line
Five minutes she stay on the move,
She'd done smoked up the stone that the builder refused
All coked up alone, she ain't even in tune
And it's sad cause she ain't really have a reason to use

She was pretty girl
Cleaner than the Board of Health
Studied and enjoyed herself, I don't know what drove her to avoid herself
Destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay'
And now she on the track, working while she wasting away
It's safe to say, she looking for a someplace to stay
Who ever got a little paper to play
Can get a slice of this...

[Chorus Repeats]

[Verse 2]
For no reason a seasoned splif was the first thing
One spring season while she's out flirting
Now she season in and don't need rehearsing
Esteem get a beating, life is uncertain
Ego need feeding, now the wants worsen
Beneath the demons she's a warm person
When she's not fiending, swearing and cursing
Behind the curtains, she's really hurting
And while her people don't even trust her at home
The dealer dem grin and cook the rocks down
And she without sin will spark the first stone
The feeling kicks in she's in the dark zone
Old friends walk pass going 'bout their own
As if she is someone that they don't know
Then the King of Kings lift her off the floor
Saying, ""Life is a thing when you learn you grow.""

[Chorus Repeats]

[Verse 3]
She rise and she fall like a star
Her life write off like a car
Her face full of all kinda scar
Always quick fi start a war
She can't keep herself up to par
She plays like a broken guitar
She always want tek it too far
I doubt she a-go mek it too far

She rise and she fall like a star
Her life write off like a car
Her face full of all kinda scar
Always quick fi start a war
She can't keep herself up to par
She plays like a broken guitar
She always want tek it too far
Mi wonder how she mek it so far",False,False,27573040.0,reggae

Justice ah weh di youths dem need overall

She nah go cry fi no guy inna nah 3 piece suit
Nor no pretty bwoy inna nuh crisp Nike boot
She nuh ball fi nah dapper
She nuh cry fi nah doop
She shed those lonely tears
For di little ghetto youths weh balling

Stary stary X-News and Gleaner
Foot might be dirty but his heart is much cleaner
And those politicians fightin down sensimillia
Get up every day dem want fi run this arena
Extra, extra.... read all about it
Ghetto youths in need and there is no doubt about it
If baby want feed and cant do without it
Big 45 goin to scout it

CHORUS

VERSE

Jack and Jill went up the hill to sell some marijuana
Buck up the fed dey broke jack crown
And Jill came tumbling after
Little Bo peep she had lost her sheep
To thief inna di pasture
And if one try do dat again
Its goin to bring disaster
King of Kings and di Lord of Lords
Everlasting Everlaster
Inspire I and I to be a microphone blaster
We nah goin bow down to no slave master

Lyrics:
Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye

Watchin' the sun bake
All of those tourists covered with oil
Strummin' my six string on my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp they're beginnin' to boil
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my long lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's nobody's fault
Don't know the reason
Stayed here all season
Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty
A Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Now I think hell it could be my fault

I blew out my flip flop
Stepped on a pop top
Cut my heel had to cruise on back home
But there's booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt

LETRA

De todas las mujeres que habitan en mí
juro que hay algunas que yo ni conozco.
Inevitablemente ya me acostumbré
a dejarle a la izquierda lo que no controlo.
Dices que hace un año que no estoy aquí,
acaba de caer un jarro de agua fría.
En este túnel nadie nos podrá escuchar,
no hay cobertura de tu boca a la mía

Inventas
Una excusa más y te lamentas,
mi lector de ojos no te encuentra
como sí que encuentra tu intención.
Accedes a mi manual de “tú no puedes”,
detectas el fallo y te me creces,
vas al rojo ganador, vas al rojo ganador.

Es demasiado tarde para dar la vuelta,
demasiado pronto para saber quién soy.
Mi vida se quedó rondando alguna puerta
alguna puerta
pero también saltó a pleno pulmón.

Las tornas van cambiando y yo no pido cuentas,
en más de una ocasión me he jodido yo.
Vencí al delirio por la escuadra y sin grandeza
y nos vamos a la cama sigue siendo “nos”.

Inventas
una excusa más y te lamentas,
mi lector de ojos no te encuentra
como sí que encuentra tu intención.
Accedes a mi manual de “tú no puedes”,
detectas el fallo y te me creces
vas al rojo ganador

Inventas
una excusa más y te lamenta,
mi lector de ojos no te encuentra
como sí que encuentra tu intención.
Accedes
a mi manual de “tú no puedes”, 
detectas el fallo y te me creces,
vas al rojo ganador, vas al rojo ganador.

De todas las mujeres que habitan en mí
juro que hay algunas que yo ni conozco

Letra ::

La policía te está extorsionando (dinero!)
pero ellos viven de lo que tú estás pagando
y si te tratan como a un delincuente (ladrón!)
no es tu culpa, dale gracias al regente.
Hay que arrancar el problema de raíz,
y cambiar al gobierno de nuestro país,
a la gente que esta en la burocracia,
a esa gente que le gustan las migajas.
Yo por eso me quejo y me quejo,
porque aquí es donde vivo y yo ya no soy un pendejo
el que no wachas, los puestos del gobierno,
hay personas que se están enriqueciendo.
Gente que vive en la pobreza,
nadie hace nada porque a nadie le interesa
Es la gente de arriba te detesta
hay más gente que quiere que caigan sus cabezas.
Si le das mas poder al poder,
mas duro te van a venir a coger
porque fuimos potencia mundial
somos pobres, nos manejan mal.
Dame dame dame dame todo el power
para que te demos en la madre
Game gime gime gime todo el poder
so I can come around to joder (2x)
Dámele, dámele, dámele, dámele todo el poder
Dámele, dámele, dámele, dámele todo el power (2x)
Así es, ¡puto! - ¡Fuck you puto baboso!
Porque no nacimos donde no hay qué comer
No hay por qué preguntarnos cómo le vamos a hacer
Si nos pintan como a unos huevones
No lo somos, ¡viva México, cabrones!
¡Que se sienta el power mexicano!
¡Que se sienta!, todos juntos como hermanos
Porque somos más, jalamos más parejo
Porque está siguiendo a una bola de pendejos
Que nos llevan por donde les conviene
Y es nuestro sudor lo que los mantiene
Los mantiene comiendo pan caliente
Ese pan es el pan de nuestra gente

Pra quem tem fé, a vida nunca tem fim. Não tem fim. Éh!

Se você não aceitou o conselho, te respeito
Resolveu seguir ir atrás, cara e coragem
Só que você sai em desvantagem se você não tem fé, se você não tem fé
Te mostro um trecho e uma passagem de um livro antigo
Pra te provar e mostrar que a vida é linda
Dura, sofrida, carente em qualquer continente
Mas boa de se viver em qualquer lugar. Éh!
Volte a brilhar, volte a brilhar!
Um vinho, um pão e uma reza, uma lua e o sol sua vida portas abertas.

Refrão:
Em algum lugar, pra relaxar, eu vou pedir pros anjos cantarem por mim
Pra quem tem fé, a vida nunca tem fim. Não tem fim.

Oh lord! Oh lord, Oh lord, Oh Ohhh lord, lord, lord....Laramace

Mostro um trecho e uma passagem de um livro antigo
Pra te provar e mostrar que a vida é linda
Dura ,sofrida, carente em qualquer continente
Mas boa de se viver em qualquer lugar

Podem até gritar, gritar, podem até barulho então fazer
Ninguem vai te escutar se não tem fé, ninguem mais vai te ver
Inclinar, seu olhar, sobre nós, e cuidar...
Inclinar, seu olhar, sobre nós, e cuidar...
Inclinar, seu olhar, sobre nós, e cuidar...
Inclinar, seu olhar, sobre nós, e cuidar...

Pra você pode ser...
(Pra você pode ser) Em algum lugar....pra relaxar...(Pra você pode ser)...eu vou pedir pros anjos cantarem por mim.
(Pra você pode ser)Pra quem tem fé a vida nunca tem fim.(Pra você pode ser) Não tem fim.

Pra você pode ser...pode ser
Nunca tem fim...(A fé na vitória tem que ser inabalável) nunca tem fim...(A vitória tem que ser inabalável).

Letra:

Se meus joelhos
Não doessem mais
Diante de um bom motivo
Que me traga fé
Que me traga fé

Se por alguns
Segundos eu observar
E só observar
A isca e o anzol
A isca e o anzol
A isca e o anzol
A isca e o anzol

Ainda assim estarei
Pronto pra comemorar
Se eu me tornar
Menos faminto
E curioso
Curioso

O mar escuro
Trará o medo
Lado a lado
Com os corais
Mais coloridos

Valeu a pena
Êh! Êh!
Valeu a pena
Êh! Êh!
Sou pescador de ilusões
Sou pescador de ilusões

Valeu a pena
Êh! Êh!
Valeu a pena
Êh! Êh!
Sou pescador de ilusões
Sou pescador de ilusões

Se eu ousar catar
Na superfície
De qualquer manhã
As palavras
De um livro
Sem final, sem final
Sem final, sem final
Final

Valeu a pena
Êh! Êh!
Valeu a pena
Êh! Êh!
Sou pescador de ilusões
Sou pescador de ilusões

Valeu a pena
Êh! Êh!
Valeu a pena
Êh! Êh!
Sou pescador de ilusões
Sou pescador de ilusões

=================================

Felizes, de uma maneira geral, geral
Estamos vivos
Aqui agora brilhando com um cristal
Somos luzes
Que faíscam no caos
E vozes abrindo um grande canal

Nós estamos na linha do tiro
Caçando os dias em horas vazias
Vizinhos do cão
Mas sempre rindo e cantando
Nunca em vão

Uma doce família
Que tem a mania
De achar alegria
Motivo e razão
Onde dizem que não
Aí que tá a mágica, meu irmão

Tá aqui e agora
No ar que rodeia
No som que nos cerca
No olho que vê
E não consegue tocar
Aí que tá o segredo, meu irmão

Que pulsa no peito
Que sente e não julga
Que tira do sério
E ascende um na cidade
E não dá pra explicar
Aí que tá o mistério, meu irmão

Eh
Descobrir o que liberta o sol
Que faz buraco
Furação do escuro, escuro, escura
Esquecer ao menos uma noite
O medo, o mal real
Que te segura

Nós estamos na linha do tiro
Caçando os dias em horas vazias
Vizinhos do cão
Mas sempre rindo e cantando
Nunca em vão

Uma doce família
Que tem a mania
De achar alegria
Motivo e razão
Onde dizem que não
Aí que tá a mágica, meu irmão

Leve e auto-reverse
Plugado no peito
Mostrando outro jeito
Batendo de frente
Com o bicho feroz, com o bicho feroz

Leve e auto-reverse
Plugado no peito
Mostrando outro jeito
Batendo de frente
Com o bicho feroz, com o bicho feroz

Pense quanto impulso
Vem de tudo ao seu redor, seu redor
Pense tudo quanto
Pode ser melhor, ser melhor
