Title : Saint-Saens : The Swan

From Wikipedia:
Le Cygne, or The Swan, is the thirteenth movement of The Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint-Saëns. This piece features a solo cello in tenor clef and two accompaniment pianos.The piece is in 6/4 time, with a key signature of G major. It makes use of legato and slurring, the music should flow like a swan gliding through the water. This piece is often played using much vibrato.

This is the only movement from the Carnival of the Animals that the composer would allow to be played in public during his lifetime as he thought the remaining movements were too frivolous and would damage his reputation as a serious composer.

The piece was written in tenor clef, although there are some arrangements in bass clef.

Because the high range of the cello is displayed in this piece, the voice is often misnamed as the violin. The cello, however, has an extremely large range and can play in this register, and its tones are rounder and more mellow..",False,False,17079428.0,opera

The composition is based upon a poem by Henri Cazalis, on an old French superstition:

    Zig, zig, zig, Death in a cadence,
    Striking with his heel a tomb,
    Death at midnight plays a dance-tune,
    Zig, zig, zig, on his violin.
    The winter wind blows and the night is dark;
    Moans are heard in the linden trees.
    Through the gloom, white skeletons pass,
    Running and leaping in their shrouds.
    Zig, zig, zig, each one is frisking,
    The bones of the dancers are heard to crack—
    But hist! of a sudden they quit the round,
    They push forward, they fly; the cock has crowed.

According to the ancient superstition, ""Death"" appears at midnight every year on Halloween. Death has the power to call forth the dead from their graves to dance for him while he plays his fiddle (represented by a solo violin with its E-string tuned to an E-flat in an example of scordatura tuning). His skeletons dance for him until the first break of dawn, when they must return to their graves until the next year.

The piece opens with a harp playing a single note, D, twelve times to signify the clock striking midnight, accompanied by soft chords from the string section. This then leads to the eerie E flat and A chords (also known as a tritone or the ""Devil's chord"") played by a solo violin, representing death on his fiddle. After which the main theme is heard on a solo flute and is followed by a descending scale on the solo violin. The rest of the orchestra, particularly the lower instruments of the string section, then joins in on the descending scale. The main theme and the scale is then heard throughout the various sections of the orchestra until it breaks to the solo violin and the harp playing the scale. The piece becomes more energetic and climaxes at this point; the full orchestra playing with strong dynamics.Towards the end of the piece, there is another violin solo, now modulating, which is then joined by the rest of the orchestra. The final section, a pianissimo, represents the dawn breaking and the skeletons returning to their graves.

The piece makes particular use of the xylophone in a particular theme to imitate the sounds of rattling bones. Saint-Saëns uses a similar motif in the Fossils part of his Carnival of the Animals.

Sözler:

Yolu yok dediğim an başladı yol
Gözü kör başı boştum sokakta 
Beni hapseden ruhum civarda
Bi mahalle bi parkta civarda limanda

50 lira düşünmeden harca
Yunus polisleri yüzümüze bakmaz
Lise girişinde trafo da boğulan
Ati bi gün harbi büyük adam olcak

Yaş 18 gençtim ve savruk
Nerden geldim gece beynimde kabus
Peşimdeler ama atamam havlu
Yatakta sabaha kadar hayal kur

Kırmızı gözler evet sanma üzülerek hepsi gülünerek hatırlanır 
Yüzüm yere yapışmadı deme bi bembeyaz melek yapıştırır

Sapıtmışız alışkınız ihanete de alkole de
Yapıştırdım sigaramı tam sotede
Eşofmanla katılıyom mahkemeye ya

Bakamam annemin yüzüne
Gece geç gelirim canım sen üzülme
Çok fazla yaş aktı gözüne
Takıldım ciğersiz dostların peşine 

Nakarat2x

Bu gece hisler pişman
Tanıdık yüzler düşman
Anlayamam
Yine bak kafam duman

Ne çabuk geçti yıllar
Dönelim mi sil baştan
Yaşayamam
Bu sene 25 yaş

2.verse

Martin garrix animals
Kiralık evlerde son sürat hız
Akılda ve dilde bi tane kız
O da eski dostlarımdan farksız

Yaşamadığım hiç bişeyi yazmadım
Yaşadım yaşlandım insan aşağolık
Başardım sanatı Para katladım
Ağladım yalnızdım ama sakladım

Zirve buysa zirvedeyim evet
Bilmeden konuşmak size beleş
Yapayalnız olmak bana kelepçe
Çıktım ortamlardan iğrenerek

Demem daha sana merhaba
Evet var ev ve araba
İlaç olamaz yarama
İnandım ben de o para denen yalana

Duman duman kilo para
Elbet bi gün Al Capone Miro baba
Güvercin sana yolladım odana
Kafama anılar düştü bu ara

Şehrimden vazgeçtim çoktan
Kanserli hücrede bitmez mikroplar
Hasetsin ve bensiz bi hiçsin boktan 
Şerefsiz ruhlarla dostluk ütopya

Nakarat2x

Bu gece hisler pişman
Tanıdık yüzler düşman
Anlayamam
Yine bak kafam duman

Ne çabuk geçti yıllar
Dönelim mi sil baştan
Yaşayamam
Bu sene 25 yaş

Lyrics:

Bozuk psikolojim ritimlerle tek gecelik ilişkim
Kalem kağıt ve bir de içkim
Elverişsiz mutlu olmak kaçtı çoktan o trenler
Sözverenler özlemezler hep bir çelişki

Zamanla değiştim gözlerimse kanlı falan
Algılarda bozukluk yaram kanar kaçansa zaman
Dalgalar cozuttu dengem zaten hep bozuktu
Değerler de üç kuruşluk beğenmezsen siktir

Hep verip veriştir böyle düzen sonuç sıfır
Son üç yılım bok gibiydi ondan önce çok deliydi
Çok yeniydim aşka dair tablolarla poz verirdim
Kankalarla poz verirdim şimdi vermiyorsam siktir

İhanetin çığlığı arkalardan gelir
Hayat sanma keriz beni beklersin hep değişmemi yok
Parıltımın nedeni pırıl pırıl olmam değil
Pis ettin sen çoktan beni değişmemin yolu yok

Nak 2x:
Gecemi basma bu yolun hiç bir sonu yok
Yanacak çakmak bu işin başka yolu yok
Bu sinir boğuyo nefretim doluyor içime
Başka yolu yok

Popüler çocuklarsa burda fazla meşhur değil
Cashin teki deler seni hemde faili meçhul değil
Gayrimeşru machine gun ın ben de peşindeyim
Diyen ibneler tripteler öyle şeyler düşünmeyin

Geçtik o yollardan çakallarla yalanlarla
Paran varsa tamam kanka diyen kolpa adamlarla
Sigara koyanlar da vardı beline koyanlar da vardı
Evine dönenler kazandı öyle sabahlarda

Yanında yılanlar da varsa gelmez huzur
Varsa kozun kan kokusuyla beslenenlerin sonu yok
Yanında krallar kafanda harbi osun
Harbi yolun belli delirdin bu yolun hiç bir sonu yok

Lyrics;

She from Italy
Hatunun tek olay para para
SST Mafia
242 style Maradona

Size papatya bize katana
Dangerous kafa baba
Olay kanımda çata patara
“Insta boy” anlasana

Stüdyo adliye karakol
Avukat mahkeme bana sor
Deste deste deste para koy
Sol kanatta Yannick Carrasco

Az önce yaktım kafam dolu
Hepsiyle yattım aynen doğru
Benim Merco rapine konu
Kıçın görmüş en fazla Polo

Puta madre
No no
Beni uzaktan sev 
Bu tur pas geç
Ortam kahpe
Menfaat Tuna nehri
Ben budapeşte
Sen cyka blyat bre

Nakarat2x

Grr grr paow söyle kimmiş kral
Shot shot shot yavşaklara Ciao
Sen dan dan dan anca like Gülşen
Senin partinde dans etmem siksen

Alles für dich mama alles für dich
Die bitch macht so blind ich kann nicht mehr seh’n
Nike triko Brasil
Die jacke Paris
Und baba kiff kiff
Ey bon appetit

Patte patte patte immer aktiv
Para para fliesst sigara stil
Big para moves mit piskopat jungs
Fick alle crews von Tiktoker kunst

Hatun dedi lütfen doggy doggy
Sexy kalça aynı Molly molly
Vaktim yok baby girl sorry sorry
Yoksa bafi benim best hobby hobby

Her zaman ayakta Koulibaly
Mevsimimim yaz like Tropic Bali
Sarışın hatunum orjinali
Çeteler arkamda sanki Cali

Nakarat2x

Grr grr paow söyle kimmiş kral
Shot shot shot yavşaklara Ciao
Sen dan dan dan anca like Gülşen
Senin partinde dans etmem siksen

Artık herkessin sen de 
(Yalan x2)
Yalanlara artık doydum sayende 
(Zaman x2) 
Zamanla bak artık herkessin sen de

Yüzüm herkese farklı 
Süzülür bebek gözyaşın ani 
Deneme bile sınama sabrı 
Söz veremem olamıyorsan harbi 
Peki ya dönerse şu kara bahtım? 
Derim onca yangınıma mazi
Tek başıma kaldım ve sardım 
Artık herkessin sen de 
Zarar ziyan 
Yine de dönemem geriye 
Yolun sonu nereye varacak 
Değil umrumda bile 
Düştüm daha derine 
Geliyorsa sana delice 
Ya git ya kal bu gece
Zaten düşe kalka sabah edicez

Artık herkessin sen de 
(Yalan x2)
Yalanlara artık doydum sayende 
(Zaman x2) 
Zamanla bak artık herkessin sen de

Şeytan ve melek 
Herkes ve sen 
Eski bir sayfasın 
Herkesleşen  
Beni yakıyo sigara gibi geceden 
Dumanlanıyom yine en tepeden 
Aynı hikaye başa sarar
Paranoyalar kafamdalar
Cennet cehennem arasında tutsaktım
İkimizin yerine yılları kurtardım 
Anla kalp paramparça 
Soğumadı hala 
Yana yana yaşamak 
Kanamadım yalana oyunlarına
Hayat oyun şahmat hep bizdik
Kirlenmiş ruhlarla çok saat geçirdik
Sahte dünyada tek gerçek para 
Sen herkesten daha fazla herkessin bana

Müzik: Astral
Mix & Mastering : Gökhan Güler

Sözler;
Eskiden parlak bi' güneş
Doğan her yeni güne
Bulduğunu sandığın ruh eş
Yol almadan yönüne
Hep heyecanlı bi' süreç
Ve fırsatlar önüne
Yüzler de neşe güleç
Her boka gülerdim sonra
Hissizleştim inceden
İstiflenmiş klişelerden
İçtim eşsiz şeyler de
En seksi yerlerden
Zenginleşti hisseler
Ehlileşti cilveler
En zekisi bendim ben
Derdi hepsi evvelden
Aştım dağlar kastıkça
Kaç yıl kalmış arkamda
Kaçtığım yazgım alnımda
Yazmış Tanrı'm aslında
Baskınlar sırf aklımda
Kaçmış tadım bastıkça
Başlı başı palavra
Âşık kaldığım kadınlar
Artık yanlızlaştıkça
Sancın salgın kadar saf
Saçtığım para aslında
Alkışlardan kaçmaktan
Yardımlaştık sandığım an
Kamçın kaldı sırtımda
Attığım adım artık taş
Baydın kalsın arkadaş
Kafam high, akıl kaçık artık
Bipolar de ben açıkladım tatlım
Sana kalsa hiç yakışmadı tavrım
Kafa yorma bu kaçıkların tarzı
Güneş (güneş)
Bize de tepeden bak (tepeden bak)
Geceler kafama kriz (geceler kriz)
Böyle mi geçer hayat (geçer hayat)
Vov, vov, vov
Kafamda sorunlar kaçış yok, ah
Kıçımda peşimden geliyo' (geliyo')
Delirdim derinden delil yok ama
Rüzgârım geriden esiyo'
Hep derbederim ben
Terk etme beni
De ki sensiz n'eyleyim
Gelir hepsi benzerin
Senin ellerindeyim
Kendi cehennemimdeyim
Tebrik ederim
Beni pes ettirdin
Karnımız aç kalsın
Ya da aşımız haşlansın
Takma tacını paslansın
Rahatına bakacaksın
Aldırıp aptallık yapıp
Aşkıma saplandım
Karşılık avlandım nasıl
Üstelik aslandım
Sarsılıp az yaktım arınıp
Artık ayağa kalktım
Herkes huşudaydı
Bu yer sanarsın Arkham'dı
Kaldıramam sandım
Anti depresan başarttı
Adadım aklı sanat yaptım
Düvel sattı salağa yattım
Güneş batsın akşam
Ararım ışık aydınlık
Güzel tatlı şaraba
Yüklenen anlam arttırılsın
İnce bi' de sigara sardın mı
İşte güzel bir anı yalnızlık
Eskiden hiç istemezdim
Tek başına bunu göğüslemezdim
Bi' değişmek içimden geldi
Geçmişe bi' sünger çekip becerdim
Sonunda kendime geldim
İçimdeki zehir erimekteydi
Psikiyatristim demişti (şey)
Daha n'olabilir ki? (n'olabilir ki? n'olabilir ki? n'olabilir ki?)
Güneş (güneş)
Bize de tepeden bak (tepeden bak)
Geceler kafama kriz (geceler kriz )
Böyle mi geçer hayat (geçer hayat)
Vov, vov, vov
Kafamda sorunlar kaçış yok, ah
Kıçımda peşimden geliyo'
Delirdim derinden delil yok ama
Rüzgârım geriden esiyo'

con el lleva una bazuka
y un rifle lanzagranadas

tres hombres suben con el
y una hembra bien ajuariada
por seguridad se ponen
sus chaecos antibalas
todos vestidos de negro
con ropa camuflajeada

otros quince pistoleros
traen suburban blindadas
tambien vestidos de negro
con la cara encapuchada
para comenzar la recia
ya tienen la retirada

con rumbo desconocido
muchos lo vieron pasar
tomaron la carretera
pa' fuera de la cuidad
la gente al ver el comando
piensa que es la federal

se volvio a soltar el perro
muy bravo y quiere morder
andan buscando enemigos
pronto lo van a saber
y van a pagar el precio
cuando se topen con el

si quieren saber la historia
prendan la television
segun ya hay varios rivales

Tonto corazón

Que será de mi
lejos de tu amor
porque a donde voy
sólo pienso en ti

Tonto corazón
la dejaste ir
pídele perdón
deja de sufrir

Sé que tu la quieres
mira no lo niegues
todas las mujeres
no te importan ya

Sé que tu la quieres
de celos te mueres
porque no la tienes
a tu lado más

Qué será de mi
cometí el error
de decirte adiós
sin una razón

Tonto corazón
ven y ayúdame
dile que esta vez
todo va a cambiar

Sé que tu la quieres
mira no lo niegues
todas las mujeres 
no te importan ya

Sé que tu la quieres
de celos te mueres
porque no la tienes
a tu lado más

Sé que tu la quieres
mira no lo niegues
todas las mujeres
no te importan ya

No te importan ya

Lyrics:

[Intro: Inspectah Deck (whispering)]
Elevation (x15)

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
Tired of trials and tribulations
It seems like life is hell, dreams the only way of escapin
To worlds that's beyond imagination
I know a place, I could take you there through elevation

[Inspectah Deck]
Where I come from young ones pump jums for lump sums
Bustin guns, trust none, become son
Truth spells broke loose shells that propel
Where I'm dwellin, niggaz bail, tellin what you sellin
My nigga tone just came home but improvised
The system tried to give him 5 more for gettin high
Fly stacy, daddy's little lady fucks crazily
Wavy after baby, lost the shape fancy lately
Used to spend the quiet nights home, now she likes to roam
Feelin quite grown, caught in like cyclones
I was taught be the wise of glide and I'll impass
To advance, learn the science of life and earn the masters
Trapped in the havoc, I'm forced to go the whole
Although, it might spell a jail cell and no parole
I fight with the force of steve austin
Until my arms can no longer hold off the coffin
In this ghetto heaven, God bless the children
Whose shattered dreams are offered and hard to mend
We don't believe in heaven, we livin in hell
Tryin to escaped, but fate's sealed in the bomb shell
Feelin like u'ey, he knew they would pnat the plot
When high-tech surveillance got my moves on watch
So, I drop jewels, use the music to educate
Can't celebrate 'til we elevate

This goes out to all my niggas 
spendin they last on gas, grass and ass
and to all my ladies playin in bars free drinks

Keep on
Ya don't stop , if ya don't stop maybe ya won't stop
If ya won't stop maybe ya can't stop

Ya don't stop , if ya don't stop maybe ya won't stop
If ya won't stop than ya can't stop
So keep on, keep on an on

[Verse 1]
Rebellious-I, felonas city slicker
Real nigga hit ya district with the impact of a twista
Now clear the zone, rhyme down the phone lines and toss motor homes
My poems were found next to dinosaur bones
Perform by the elders before the kings thrown
This style has no origin or birth date
And scientists research can not calculate
The great mind skatin' through space and time
Vibratin' thru the bass lines that stun man kind
Reclined in the leather seat the cassette blasts
Vocals that smash out the bullet proof glass
Rippin' through your 15's like Wolverine
Sick with the lyric there be no vacine
You attach with the tractor beam, rap fiend
And all heads who feel it lick off a magazine

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
We trip the light, ride to the rhythm's of the night
Skin tight honeys show me love at first sight
Work light krazy legs nonstop body drop
My hip hop drop you to your knees in shock
Watch for the spot rushers, slang hustler
Lackluster skills, solute the drill instructor
Yes yes ya'll I heard the 'S.O.S.' call
INS to the rescue about to bless ya'll
Got 'em brawlin' in the mess hall and the dance hall
They ants ya'll and I remain to stand tall
Can't fall, son'll restore like Michael Jackson off the wall
Singin' life ain't so bad at all
When ya livin' it we all deserve the finer things
Like foreign cars fancy clothes and diamond rings
My exotic dancers keep shakin' ya thing
To my niggas on the streets thats soon to be king

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Keep on keep on an on
Last call for alcohol bartender two kahlua's and milk 
with crushed ice in the blender
What up love?
Lets jelly off the dancefloor
before ya man come lookin' for points he can't score
More than you bargained for ,deserve an encore
Putt 'em down ,you put 'em up till ya sore
Motion picture thoughts project in wide screens
Laced off the lime green, duckin' high beams
Swift sword, making fetti out the bill board
Rap pro, throwin' up bombs like Jeff Joard
Catch me next tour feel free to explore
Don't sweat me at the door like we met before
Tryin' to dick ride, I'm inside where the chicks hide
Quick slide move, we lootin' the spy...
Quick slide move, we lootin' the spy

Lyrics:
[Inspectah Deck]
Oh, Killah Hill, Killah Killa Hill
Killah Hill, Killah Killah Hill
Killah Hill, Killah Killah Hill
10304 style, kid, yea
For all my D.M.D. Rec posse niggaz
You out there? Is you out there?

I throw your brain in the cobra clutch, behold the hold rush
A dazzlin display if you could get close enough
Cold Crush like the 4 stinger anaconda
Fierce darts that'll pierce through solid armor
Lounge in the barracks with Blue and Cappadonna
Spiderman identity Peter Parker
Crowd pleaser register off the meter
Vocal street sweaper bucks shots through the speaker
Pleasure seekers, 50 thou' in the stands
True fans get it hot like Jamaica sands
Conquer land, wide like a eagle wingspan
Clansman stabbin the track with both hands
Not a lost soul who falls for fool's gold
I shine like a diamond in the true state of cold
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
Rap with a road block, I might lose control
Hold the globe in my iron palm
One hand holds the firearm on a mission that's life long
Strike calm through the fire like Chaka Khan
World wide on the web without the dot com

[Chorus]
Killa Bees live in the place be
Burn third degree on the M-I-C
So deadly goes the catastrophe
And this is the way we crash the party
Say
Rec, Rec, Rec, Rec, Rec, Rec, Rec, Rec
Rec, Rec, Rec, Rec, Rec, Rec, Rec, Rec

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, Killa Bees swarmin
Protect Ya Neck! What's the warnin?
So, procede with caution, I walk with my swordsmen
We all in together, Wu-Tang forever gon' win
From Puerto Rico 'cross the caves of Berlin
Echoin through cell blocks and federal pens
It be the Wu-Tang, you came in when
They left the game mentally and physically bent
What I invent, sharp as bardwire fence
I represent, sure to make a grand entrance 
With the deadly lecture, contents under pressure
Inspectah, put your rep in the stretcher
Feather weight contenders surrender
T.K.O., first round knockout, vets to big spenders
Journey on the mic like Marco Polo
Internal bleedin occurs to your photo
Thoughts brought forth as wild as up north
It's bloodsport, get rushed for tough talk
But I hold my ground like it's high noon
While police tapes surround the mic room
I jump on a live tune, provide the boom
Those who consume become faint from the fumes

Lyrics:
[Inspectah Deck]
Four wheelers, pop the hatchet, blast that hitter
Honey times, money hurry, snap that picture
I wanna see the walls come down, if ya'll bout it
For New York, I cover the sport, like Marv Albert
One, two, when I exhale, the one-two
Lock it down, similar to Denzel in John Q.
Fire the semi, with no ice, no Bentley
I'm just low fitty, throwin' limes in the Remy
There's so many fraud, how could you call that real?
I supply fire that'll forge the steel
Can't ignore the real, yeah ya forcedthe deal (With who?)
With that nigga, that kid, you're sure to feel
Big money, big guns, big cars and all
Rock tally on the floor, at the Monster's Ball
From the 718 to the 310
Underdawgz, U.D,'s, the unsung heroes

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
They see me in the streets they be like (That's that nigga)
Rebel I.N.S., ya'll know (That's that nigga)
Girls of the world be sayin' (That's that nigga)
All across the board they goin' (That's that nigga)
Girls of the world say (That's that nigga)
All across the board they goin' (That's that nigga)
They see him in the streets they be like (That's that nigga)
Rebel I.N.S., ya'll know (That's that nigga)

[Inspectah Deck]
The Movement, follow my lead, clock my speed
Number one with a bullet, that's cocked to squeeze
He's artist of the year, who can touch me son?
Like Jimmy Casta, trust me, I've just begun
And I won't stop, hoggin' the lane, droppin' my game
My dogs be, rockin' them chains, poppin' the same
In the distance, hawkin' my style, talkin' loud
Non-believers wonder how I'm talk of the town
Hate Me Now, like Puffy and Nas, I uprise
Never thought big guns would survive, but surprise
Now what nigga? Only drugs sell quicker
Been chained in the dungeons of rap and held prisoner
You'll find me, cruisin' the Ave., tool in the stash
My tomb blast you in the smash, movin' the mass
I'm comin' like the taxman for all their business
I'm bound by my honor, so ya'll bear witness

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
A Titan like Steve McNair, be prepared
For the Top Gun, smokin' like weed in the air
Please beware, the Underdawgz roam in the yard
Postin' hard, approachin' get you closer to God
This is real life money, not a scene from a movie
U.D.'s tighter than the jeans on a hoochie
The groupies crowd the 6 point o
If it's like that now, wait til this joint blow
Tell the world, the prophet has come, problem for some
The masses, holla for son, hot as the sun
That keep your eyes open don't you get caught sleepin'
Your boy get you bouncin' like a six four leanin'

Synopsis:
Have you ever stopped to think if the most ordinary, uninteresting, unobtrusive man you might see on the road or around you might have a love story to tell? Maybe not! How can an ordinary man have a breathtaking, goose flesh igniting, awe inspiring love story of all things to tell?

This is what happened to Surinder Sahni (Shah Rukh Khan) - a simple, clean hearted, honest man, leading a humdrum life, when he meets his total opposite and finds love in the flamboyant, fun-loving, vivacious - Taani (Anushka Sharma) for whom the whole world is her canvas and she paints her own life with the colours of rainbow all until unforeseen circumstances changes it all and brings them together.

What follows is a journey filled with laughter, tears, joy, pain, music, dance and a lot of love. A journey that makes us believe that there is an extraordinary love story in every ordinary jodi (couple).

Lyrics
Ese amor llega así de ésta manera
No tiene la culpa
Caballo de danza vana
Porque es muy despreciado por eso

No te perdono llorar

Ese amor llega asi esta manera
No tiene la culpa
Amor de compra y venta
Amor de en el pasado

Bem, bem bem bem, bem bem bem
Bem, bem bem bem, bem bem bem

Bamboleo bambolea
Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi
Bamboleo bambolea
Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi

No tienes perdón de Dios
Tu eres mi vida la fortuna del destino
En el destino del desamparado
Lo mísmo ya que ayer
Lo mísmo soy yo

No te encuentro l'abandon
Eres imposible no te encuentro de verdad
Por eso un dia no encuentro si de nada
Lo mísmo ya que ayer
Lo pienso en ti

Bamboleo bambolea
Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi
Bamboleo bambolea
Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi

Bamboleo bambolea
Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi
Bamboleo bambolea
Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi

Bamboleo bambolea
Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi
Bamboleo bambolea
Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi

Bamboleo bambolea
Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi
Bamboleo bambolea

Pienso que un sueño parecido no volverá más
Y me pintaba las manos lon cara d' azul
Y de improviso el viento rápido me llevó
Y me hizo volar en el cielo infinito

Volaré oh oh
Cantaré oh oh oh oh
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassu

Y volando, volando feliz
Yo me encuentro más alto, más alto que el sol
Mientras el mundo se aleja despacio de mí
Una música dulce tocada sólo para mí

Volaré oh oh
Cantaré oh oh oh oh
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassu

Y me pintaba las manos lon cara d' azul

Alegria
Come un lampo di vita
Alegria
Come un pazzo gridar
Alegria
Del delittuoso grido
Bela ruggente pena,
Seren
Come la rabbia di amar
Alegria
Come un assalto di gioia

Alegria
I see a spark of life shining
Alegria
I hear a young minstrel sing
Alegria
Beautiful roaring scream
Of joy and sorrow,
So extreme
There is a love in me raging
Alegria
A joyous,
Magical pfeeling

Alegria
Come un lampo di vita
Allegria
Come un pazzo gridar
Alegria
Del delittuoso grido
Bella ruggente pena,
Seren

Del delittuoso grido
Bella ruggente pena,
Seren
Come la rabbia di amar
Alegria
Come un assalto di gioia
Alegria

Como la luz de la vida
Alegria

Alegria

Lyrics
Por el camino del desierto
El viento me despeina
Sube el aroma de colita
Luna, luna de nadie
Ella a lo lejos
Una luz centela
La idea de mi estar
Quedar por la noche
Alli estaba a la entrada
Y las campanas a sonar
Y me di con llamarme mismo
Que es puerta del cielo
Ella enciende una vela
En muestra del camino
Suenan voces en el corredor
Y lo que indican diciend

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place

Ella al lado que brillaba
Tenia una Mercedes
Rodeada de chicos guapos
Ella llamaba amigos

Cuando viene despacio
Del tumba de verano
Aquel era pa recordar
Y otro pa olvidar

Le pedi al capitan
Que sirve el vino
Y pedi con un amor
Tenido este alcohol
De este sesenta y nueve
Famosa y que llamando
Pues me va a despertar

La noche para decir
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place

Such a lovely place
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place
El espejo en el techo
Champana en el hielo
Y ella dijo somos todos prisioneros
De propia voluntad
Y en los cuartos principales
Hacen sucias esta
Hasta aca a la bestia
Pero no la logra a matar

Mi ultimo recuerdo
Corria hacia la puerta
Ver una candela en el camino
Por donde habia llegado
""Relax"" dijo el portero
Por mi es honor recibir
Puede salir cuando quiere

Pero nunca yo partir
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place

Such a lovely place
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place",True,True,,flamenco

The composition is a milestone for jazz musicians' progress, given the difficulty of improvising its rapid progression of chord changes that progress through three keys (see Coltrane changes) shifted by major thirds, creating an augmented triad.

The saxophonist had previously used this technique on the LP Blue Train on the tunes Moment's Notice and Lazy Bird. Coltrane continued in this vein on a recording with Cannonball Adderley of the standard ""Limehouse Blues,"" and on his original ""Fifth House."" He continued to use this approach on other tunes, such as ""Countdown"", based on the Miles Davis tune ""Tune Up""; ""26 2"" based on Charlie Parker's ""Confirmation""; and a reharmonization of the jazz standard ""Body and Soul."" Songs such as ""Naima"" and ""Like Sonny"" also show some harmonic similarity to ""Giant Steps."" Coltrane continued to employ similar concepts in his soloing during his more open and modal middle period. A Love Supreme features examples of lines based on ""Giant Steps"" cycles over modal vamps, to create a Polytonal effect (see modal jazz).

The progression continues to stimulate harmonic thinking in contemporary jazz. There are a number of different approaches to soloing on the song. While Coltrane favoured arpeggiation over the changes, other players have used different tricks and patterns to bring out the sound of the changes. The chord progression was later used by Freddie Hubbard as a basis for his composition ""Dear John"" (on Hubbard's 1991 album Bolivia). Covers have been recorded by such artists as Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Pat Metheny, Buddy Rich, Jaco Pastorius, Mike Stern, Greg Howe, Tommy Flanagan (who played on the original recording), McCoy Tyner, Kenny Werner, Kenny Garrett, Woody Herman, and Taylor Eigsti, Gary Bartz. The song was recorded by Chaka Khan in 1982 as part of the ""Be Bop Medley"" from her album ""Chaka Khan"".

John Coltrane was known for coming into the studio with unrehearsed songs - ""Giant Steps"" was no exception. On the original recording, Tommy Flanagan (piano) played a choppy start-stop solo where it sounds like he is struggling to improvise over Coltrane changes without adequate preparation. Flanagan would revisit Giant Steps on several recordings later in his career and mastered the progression. In some of the alternate takes, Cedar Walton is at the piano, declining to take a solo and also playing at a slower tempo than the takes with Flanagan.",False,False,24154860.0,jazz

I've heard people say that
Too much of anything is not good for you, baby
Oh no
But I don't know about that
There's many times that we've loved
We've shared love and made love

And baby, that's no lie
Oh no, babe

Tell me, what can I say?
What am I gonna do?
How should I feel when everything is you?
What kind of love is this that you're givin' me?
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?

Lyrics:
My first, the last, my everything
And the answer to all my dreams
You're my sun, my moon, my guiding star
My kind of wonderful, that's what you are
I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
You're all I'm living for, your love I'll keep forevermore
First, you're the last, my everything
And with you I've found so many things
A love so new, only you could bring
Can't you see it's you? You make me feel this way (Can't you see it's you?)
You're like a first morning dew on a brand new day
I see so many ways that I
Can love you 'til the day I die
You're my reality, yet I'm lost in a dream
You're the first, the last, my everything
I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
Girl, you're my reality, but I'm lost in a dream
You're the first, you're the last, my everything
You and me babe is you

LYRICS: 
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere to go
Many years ago
Would you allow?
Could you allow?
That’s what they’re like
Did you look?
Did you look?
Heavenly, heavenly sort of sounds adolescent
Well I told you not, not to look from the start?
When the sun is almost gone it’s way too much
 
Enough said
Enough sense
It’s unconventional
When the sun is almost gone it’s not enough
Suddenly, finally without a yell I’ll listen
 
That’s what we’re like in broad daylight 
Soon you’ll realize
It’s after midnight
 
My memories, souvenirs, some originals
High up in the rows
Idolized, canonized
That morning rise
I told you not, 
I told you not
No veneer behind the mirror
Did you call from a distance?
Well I told you not, not to look from this side
When the sun is almost gone it’s way too much
 
Enough said
Enough sense
It’s unconditional
When the sun is almost gone it’s not enough
Suddenly, finally without a yell I’ll listen 
 
That’s what we’re like in broad daylight 
Soon you’ll realize
It’s after midnight
 
Listen it’s illicit
Listen listen it’s illicit
Listen listen it’s illicit
Listen listen listen

LYRICS: 

So sentimental
Not sentimental no !
Romantic not disgusting yet
Darling I'm down and lonely
When with the fortunate only
I've been looking for something else
Do let do let do let jugulate do let do let do

Let's go slowly, discouraged,
Distant from other interests
On your favorite weekend ending
This love's for gentlemen only
That's with the fortunate only
No I gotta be someone else
These days it comes it comes it comes it comes it comes and goes

Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh !
I'm not easily offended
It's not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses

Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh !
I'm not easily offended
It's not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses

Follow, misguide, stand still
Disgust, discourage
On this precious weekend ending
This love's for gentlemen only
Wealthiest gentlemen only
And now that you're lonely
Do let do let do let jugulate do let do let do

Let's go slowly, discouraged,
We'll burn the pictures instead
When it's all over we can barely discuss
For one minute only
Not with the fortunate only
Thought it could have been something else
These days it comes it comes it comes it comes it comes and goes

Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, Oh !
I'm not easily offended
It's not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses

LYRICS: 

Could you could you come tonight?
Instead of going under
Could you could you come tonight?
Would you think it’d be her last December?

Could it be the way she combs her hair
It must have been the day you lost to care
What if I was the answer to your prayer
Yeah you need a little candor, need a little candor

What if we last till it’s dawn like you promised me
Who let the boys spill their entree?
Dinner is served, can’t you see we’re not opposites
Are you still up thinking of me?

I take all the blame
Is it hard to understand?
When it’s all the same
I’ve played all the games
And lost almost everything
Now I talk to myself and it’s quite surprising

Roll with me
Let’s roll

Could you could you come tonight?
I’m counting from the thunder
Could you could you come tonight?
I got a feeling that you know the number

Could I be the best to jump ahead
Your feet are hurting less with moccasins
I never heard another comment since
Yeah you need a little splendor, need a little splendor

What if we last till it’s dawn like you promised me
Who let the boys spill their entree?
Dinner is served, can’t you see we’re not opposites
Are you still up thinking of me?

I take all the blame
Is it hard to understand?
When it’s all the same
I’ve played all the games
And lost almost everything
Now I talk to myself and it’s quite surprising

Roll with me
Let’s roll with me

I talk to myself and it’s quite surprising
In the middle of the night
Now I talk to myself and it’s quite surprising
In the middle of a fight
Can’t you see the sign up on the wall 
In the middle of the night
Can’t you see the sign up on the wall
In the middle of a fight
I talk to myself and it’s quite surprising

Roll with me
Let’s roll with me

Oh how I wish I could be someone like you
Be someone else, someone else, someone like you

LYRICS:

Did you did you did you know
Did you did you know
Every color turned blue?
How to find the shore in a waterfall 
Oh that rumor sounds true
Yeah I hear it too
 
I’m looking for an Artefact
A piece of me that’s still intact, yeah
I’m looking for an Artefact
What part of me can still attract you?
 
Before you were born
Before we were one
Before you were loose
 
And when on your own
I considered it home
Believed it was you
 
I’d leave it alone
I deleted it all
Because it was true
 
And when you get upset
I can’t afford it
I won’t deny it
Over Nova Scotia
I’m no Rubirosa
This story comes and…
 
And when you get upset
I kinda like it
Don’t leave me skull and bones
And with your Boyfriends
I can’t escape them
This story comes and goes
 
How finally has a bitter tone
You’r wish I’d never known
Nothing that follows sounds new
Heart of styrofoam
Over the telephone
Oh let the rumor run through
Here I tell the truth
 
I’m looking for an Artefact
A piece of me that’s still intact, yeah
I’m looking for an Artefact
What part of me can still attract you?
 
Before you were born
Before we were one
Before you were loose
 
And when on your own
I considered it home
Believed it was you
 
I’d leave it alone
I deleted it all
Because it was true
 
And when you get upset
I can’t afford it
I won’t deny it
Over Nova Scotia
I’m no Rubirosa
This story comes and…
 
And when you get upset
I kinda like it
Don’t leave me skull and bones
And with your Boyfriends
I can’t escape them
This story comes and goes
 
Oh did you did you did you know
Did you did you know
Every color turned blue?
How to find the shore in a waterfall 
Oh that rumor sounds true
Yeah I hear it too

LYRICS: 
A restricted area
Shaped like a Petunia
Thank god you know your ways
It’s in your mind
It’s on all the time
 
And I find it hard to explain
What would you trade me for
This girl’s playing hula hoop
Under the malicious 
Winter solstice  
 
Turn the lights on
Find me a narrative
Something positive
This Requiem played a few times before
I heard it once
So I’m not sure
On the phone ""I told you""
Why open your eyes to go to bed?
Drive straight to the ocean
Let’s see what you won’t find out
Even the righteous beheaded their loved ones
 
Now it’s hard to connect
But the world’s unchained
And soon 
It’ll be public domain
It’s too hard to remain
Astute
 
But I will stay
If you’re detained
With you
I’ll wash my hands 
Until It rains 
Through you
 
Keeping the lights on
Obliged to the bygones
Thank god you know your ways
If this time it’s true
Why bother reeling you?
 
All this fine jewelry
Look at this diamond shaped out of glass 
I’ll try to make this Ruby shine nice
I’m trying to make a living
Is that something that you don’t mind
Fine
Did you ever think it could have been in our lifetime?
 
So give me a ride home
Find me a narrative
Something positive
This Requiem played a few times before
I heard it twice
So I’m not sure
On the phone ""I told you""
Why open your eyes to go to bed?
Drive straight to the ocean
Let’s see what you won’t find out
Cover you eyes for Winter Solstice?
 
Now it’s hard to connect
But the world’s unchained
And soon 
It’ll be public domain
It’s too hard to remain
Astute
 
But I will stay
If you’re detained
With you
I’ll wash my hands 
Until It rains 
Through you

Lyrics: 
Take a moment to decide to compromise
You let me know some other time, some other day
You're now closer to the start than to the limit
Take a bow, vow to the sky, if you want to wait, great!

Woo ha
Singing Hallelujah
Pray to your God
Cover your lies
God or Guru
Hey Hey Hey

Woo ha
Singing Hallelujah
Run for your life
Cover your eyes
Alphazulu
Hey Hey

Tell me why, don't tell me when, don't tell me how
I must have died at 51 in 1953
Just accounting to the stars, the only reason I'm allowed
There's a purple cloud in the consommé, ouais

Woo ha
Singing Hallelujah
Pray to your God
Cover your lies
God or Guru
Hey Hey Hey

Woo ha
Singing Hallelujah
Run for your life
Cover your eyes
Alphazulu

Why choose your body over time?
Why choose your body over time with me?

Get your close up to sublime the alibi
Your Mona Lisa immortalized, décapitée
I wouldn't change I wouldn't try another second
Till I rise a hologram waiting for the tie-break

Woo ha
Singing Hallelujah
Pray to your God
Cover your lies
God or Guru
Hey Hey Hey

Woo ha
Singing Hallelujah
Run for your life
Cover your eyes
Alphazulu

Why choose your body over time?
Why choose your body over time with me?

Song: E for Extinction
Album: Welcome to the Masquerade

I'm not the same as yesterday
Ooh...It's hard to explain
How things have changed
But I'm not the same as before
And I know there's so much more ahead
I can barely believe that I'm here
And I won't surrender quietly
Step up and watch me go

Break down, ya really want it?
Wanna make a scene?
Show me what ya mean
Let's get it started
Let me see whatcha got
Can ya take it up a knotch?
Don't think you got it
Can't handle the pressure?
Get, off, stop talkin' about it
Gotta make this count, let's go

When we move
We camouflage ourselves
We stand in the shadows waiting
We live for this and nothing more
We are what You created

I can feel the storm
The winds have changed
Ooh...'Cause we're worlds a part
But just the same
But we won't leave the way that we came
And I know there's so much more ahead
I can barely believe that we're here
We won't surrender quietly
Step up and watch it go

Are you ready? Are ya ready?
Are ya ready for me?

Lyrics:
Come on out of your dreams
And wake up from your reverie
Time is here don’t go to sleep
Streets are running on the brink
They say that we’ve got nothing
But a dollar for a life of sin
Cos there’s trouble on the way
Oh there’s trouble on the way
get a dog and pony for a judgement day
 
Here we are
Running circles around around around around
When nothing’s right just close your eyes close your eyes and you’re gone
 
Dreams Dreams Dreams  Dreams
She’s making me high, she’s making me high
Dreams Dreams Dreams  Dreams
She’s making me high I wanna get me free
 
Nothing gonna get me in my world
 
Now can these broken wings free me
about a light year from reality
If you want to fall in a dream
You could put the weight right onto me 
 
Here we are
Running circles around around around around
When nothing’s right just close your eyes close your eyes and you’re gone
 
Dreams Dreams Dreams  Dreams
She’s making me high, she’s making me high
Dreams Dreams Dreams  Dreams
She’s making me high I wanna get me free

 
Nothing gonna get me in my world
Nothing gonna get me in my world
 
Ahhhh, stop fucking with my dreams dreams yeah
Ahhhh, stop fucking with my dreams dreams yeah
Here we are…
 
Running circles around around around around
When nothing’s right just close your eyes close your eyes and you’re gone
 
Dreams Dreams Dreams  Dreams
She’s making me high, she’s making me high
Dreams Dreams Dreams  Dreams
She’s making me high I wanna get me free

Nothing gonna get me in my world
 
I wanna get me free

Lyrics:
When you get the rhythm and words all make you cold
When they break it down and this world is all you know
Hands up you’re working it round now get yourself together
When you call the dominoes fall it’s time to go

Now I’m feeling so far away
See the colors and all the kids going home
Night is crawling up to the day
Hear the noise ringing the sirens all singing

Just wanna stay up all night with you
Just wanna stay up all night with you
There’s nothing that I wouldn’t rather do
Just wanna stay up all night with you

Keep on moving
Don’t wait for nothing now
Keep on moving
Don’t wait for nothing now
Oh keep on moving
Don’t wait, don’t wait for nothing now
Oh keep on moving
Don’t wait for nothing now

One two, what you doing
I’ve been jumping through some hoops
Wanna get my body loose
Wanna tell you tell you what to do
I been running
On a wheel like an animal struggling
Looking for a diamond
I’m trying
I’m fighting
Right into the rhythm now

Just wanna stay up all night with you
Just wanna stay up all night with you
There’s nothing that I wouldn’t rather do
Just wanna stay up all night with you

Put it up in the air
If you don’t really care
Let them know that you’re there
If you got the time to take it up there
Hands up in the air
Livin’ out on a prayer
Let them know that you’re there
If you got the time to take it up there

Up all night with you
With you
With you

Woke up this morning, found a love light in the storm
Looked up this morning, saw the roses full of thorns
Guns are falling, they don't have nowhere to go
Oceans of diamonds always shine, smooth out below

Can we start it all over again this morning?
I lost all my defenses this morning
Won't you show me the way it used to be?

I've gone all around 'til there's nothing left to say
Wrote it all down into something that couldn't be said
I tore it all down and buried me underneath the wave

Can we start it all over again this morning?
I let down my defenses this morning
It was just you and me this morning
I fought all my guesses this morning
Won't you show me the way it could've been?

Well the south side of chicago
Is the baddest part of town
And if you go down there
You better just beware
Of a man named leroy brown

Now leroy more than trouble
You see he stand 'bout six foot four
All the downtown ladies call him ""treetop lover""
All the mens just call him ""sir""

And it's bad, bad leroy brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old king kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Now leroy he a gambler
And he like his fancy clothes
And he like to wave his diamond rings
In front of everybody's nose
He got a custom continental
He got an eldorado too
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe

And it's bad, bad leroy brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old king kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Well friday bout a week ago
Leroy shootin' dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named doris
And ooh that girl looked nice
Well he cast his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
And leroy brown learned a lesson
'bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man

And it's bad, bad leroy brown
The baddest man in the whole damned town
Badder than old king kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog,

Well the two men took to fightin'
And when they pulled them from the floor
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle
With a couple of pieces gone

And it's bad, bad leroy brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old king kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog",False,False,88377813.0,traditional folk music

He's gonna make it in the city playin guitar in the studio
Well he hadn't been there an hour, when he met a Broadway flower
You know she took him for his money and she left him in a cheap hotel   

Well it's easy for you to see, that that country boy is me
I'm sayin how'm I gonna ever break the news to the folks back home
Well I was gonna be a great success, things sure ended up a mess
But in the process, I got messed up too  

Well hello momma and dad I had to call collect
cause I aint got a cent to my name
Well I'm sleepin in the hotel doorway
And tonight they say it's gonna rain
And if you'd only send me some money
I'd be back on my feet again
Send it in care of the Sunday Mission Box Number 10  

Oh back in southern Illinois, they still worryin' bout that boy
But this boy's goin home soon as he gets the fare
Because as soon as I got my bread, I got a pipe upside my head
You know they left me in an alley, took my money and my guitar too

Well, I'm sorry for the things that I told you
But words only go so far
And if I had my way
I would reach into heaven
And I'd pull down a star for a present
And I'd make you a chain out of diamonds
And pearls from a summer sea
But all I can give you is a kiss in the morning
And a sweet apology

Well, I know that it hasn't been easy
And I haven't always been around
To say the right words
Or to hold you in the mornin'
Or to help you when you're down
I know I never showed you much of a good time
But baby things are gonna change
I'm gonna make up for all of the hurt I brought
I'm gonna love away all your pain

Chorus:
And tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day
There's gonna be some changes
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day
This time you can believe me
No more cryin' in your lonely room
And no more empty nights
'Cause tomorrow mornin' everything will turn out right

Well, there's something that I've got to tell you
Yes I've got something on my mind
But words come hard
When your lying in my arms
And when I'm looking deep into your eyes
But there's truth and consolation
And what I'm trying to say
Is that nobody ever had a rainbow baby
Until he had the rain

Chorus

It's gonna, it's gonna, it's gonna be a brighter day

Photographs and memories
Christmas cards you sent to me
All that I have are these
To remember you

Memories that come at night
Take me to another time
Back to a happier day
When I called you mine

Chorus:
But we sure had a good time
When we started way back when
Morning walks and bedroom talks
Oh how I loved you then

Summer skies and lullabies
Nights we couldn't say good-bye
And of all of the things that we knew
Not a dream survived

Photographs and memories
All the love you gave to me
Somehow it just can't be true
That's all I've left of you

La musica e’ una delle vie per le quali l’anima ritorna al cielo
Music is one of the ways for which the soul returns to heaven
Musik ist eine der Arten, auf die die Seele in den Himmel zurückkehrt
La musique est l'un des moyens par lesquels l'âme retourne au ciel
La música es una de las formas en que el alma regresa al cielo
A música é uma das formas pelas quais a alma retorna ao céu
الموسيقى هي إحدى الطرق التي تعود بها الروح إلى السماء
音乐是灵魂回归天堂的方式之一
音楽は、魂が天国に帰る道の一つです
Музыка - один из способов возвращения души к небу

You go to my head
You go to my head,
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne.

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two.

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought
To my plea casts a spell over me
Still I say to myself: get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it can never be?

You go to my head
With smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Tho I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance,
You go to my head.",False,False,8931598.0,jazz
