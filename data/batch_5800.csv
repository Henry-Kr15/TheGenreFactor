Lyrics:

Sittin' on a bench at West Town Mall
He sat down in his overalls and asked me
You waitin' on a woman
I nodded yeah and said how 'bout you
He said son since nineteen fifty-two I've been
Waitin' on a woman

When I picked her up for our first date
I told her I'd be there at eight
And she came down the stairs at eight-thirty
She said I'm sorry that I took so long
Didn't like a thing that I tried on
But let me tell you son she sure looked pretty
Yeah she'll take her time but I don't mind
Waitin' on a woman",True,True,20594725.0,country music

About Bad Boy Entertainment:

In 1993, Sean “Puff Daddy” Combs, also known as Diddy, launched Bad Boy Records. Nobody could have
imagined the impact the label would have on pop culture. As a subsidiary of the larger Bad Boy
Entertainment, the label became best known for its signature sound of streetwise hip-hop soul and the
ghetto fabulousness that radiated like precious jewels from its very name. Bad Boy was designed for
those who aspired higher, but also wanted to party until the break of dawn. Puffy had seen life from

no better visual embodiment of this merger than the groundbreaking videos that were in heavy rotation

Daddy, Craig Mack, Faith Evans, 112, Total, Mase, Yung Joc, Cassie, Danity Kane, and the rest of the Bad
Boy Family, and your destination for some of the biggest 90s and 00s hip-hop hits of all time like Craig
Mack’s “Flava In Your Ear (Remix)”, the Notorious B.I.G. tribute “I’ll Be Missing You” by Puff Daddy feat.

About Bad Boy Entertainment:

In 1993, Sean “Puff Daddy” Combs, also known as Diddy, launched Bad Boy Records. Nobody could have
imagined the impact the label would have on pop culture. As a subsidiary of the larger Bad Boy
Entertainment, the label became best known for its signature sound of streetwise hip-hop soul and the
ghetto fabulousness that radiated like precious jewels from its very name. Bad Boy was designed for
those who aspired higher, but also wanted to party until the break of dawn. Puffy had seen life from
both sides of the class divide and, with his groove-heavy music, worked hard to merge the two. There is
no better visual embodiment of this merger than the groundbreaking videos that were in heavy rotation
on BET and MTV and now on YouTube.

sochta houn ke woh kitne masoom thay by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan
sochta woh kitne masoom thay Nusrat qawali

The Lyrics of Sochta Hoon Keh Woh Kitne Masoom Thay 

Ab to haathon
Ab to haathon se lakeere mit ti jati hain
Us ko kho kar to mere pass raha kuch bhi nahi

Kal bichadna hai - ""sargam""
Kal bichadna hai to phir ehad-e-wafa soch k baad
Abhi aagaz-e-mohabbat hai gaya kuch bhi nahi
Main to is vaste chup hoon k Tamasha na bane
Tu smjhta hai mujhe tujhse gila kuch bhi nahi
Main - ""Sargam""
Main to is vaste chup hoon k Tamasha na bane
Tu smjhta hai mujhe tujhse gila kuch bhi nahi
Sochta hoon -3
Hashar hai wahashatey Dil ki aawargi -3
Humse pucho mohobbat ki deewangi - 2
Hashar hai wahashatey Dil ki aawargi, Humse pucho mohobbat ki deewangi
Jo pata puchte the kisi ka kabhi -2
Laapata ho gaye dekhte dekhte
Jo pata puchte the kisi ka kabhi, Laapata ho gaye dekhte dekhte -3
Humse ye soch kar koi wada karo -3
Ek wade pe umren guzar jayengi -2
Humse ye soch kar koi wada karo
Ek wade pe umren guzar jayengi
Ye hai dunia yahan kitne aehl-e-wafa -2
Bewafa ho gaye dekhte dekhte
""Sargam""
Ye hai dunia yahan kitne aehl-e-wafa, Bewafa ho gaye dekhte dekhte -3
Ke Humse ye soch kar koi wada karo, Ek wade pe umren guzar jayengi -2
Humse ye soch kar koi wada karo
Din chupgya,
ho din chupgya-chupgya-chupgya -2
Din chup gya sooraj ka kahin naam nahi hai -2
O wada shikal ab bhi teri shaam nahi hai -3
O wada shikal - wada shikal
Shab-e-wada - Shab-e-wada ye raha karti hai baatein dil se
Dehke yaar aata hai pehle ya kaza aati hai
Kal se be kal hoon main
Kal se be kal hoon bhala khaak mujhe kal aaye -2
Kal ka wada tha na vo aaj aaye na vo kal aaye
O wada shikal - wada shikal -2
Roz ka intezar kon kare -2
Aapka aitbaar kon kare
O wada shikal - wada shikal -2
Ho chuka wada k kab aayie ga -2
Dekhiye ab na bhool jaiye ga
O wada shikal - wada shikal -2
Bhala koi wada khilafi ki had hai -2
Hisab apne - hisab apne dil main laga kar to socho
Bhala koi wada khilafi ki had hai
Hisab apne - hisab apne dil main laga kar to socho
Qayamat ka din aa gya rafta-rafta
Mulakaat ka din badalte-badalte
O wada shikal - wada shikal -2
Re humse ye soch kar koi wada karo
Ek wade par umren guzar jayengi -2
Ye hai dunia yahan kitne aehl-e-wafa -2
Bewafa ho gaye dekhte dekhte
Ye hai dunia yahan kitne aehl-e-wafa, Bewafa ho gaye dekhte dekhte
Gair ki baat tasleem kya kijiye -2
Gair ki baat tasleem kya kijiye
Ab to khud par bhi humko bharosa nahi -2
Gair ki baat tasleem kya kijiye, Ab to khud par bhi humko bharosa nahi
Apna saya smjhte the jinko kabhi -2
Vo juda ho gaye dekhte dekhte
Apna saya smjhte the jinko kabhi, Vo juda ho gaye dekhte dekhte
Sochta hoon ke vo kitne masoom the
Kya se kya ho gye dekhte dekhte olne lage to humhi par baras pade
Hashar hai wahshat e dil ki aawargi
Humse poocho mohabbat ki deewangi
Jo pata poochte the kisi ka kabhi
La pata ho gaye dekhte dekhte
Humse ye Soch kar koi wada karo...
Din chup gaya suraj ka kahin naam Nahin hai
O wada shikan ab bhi Teri shaam nahi hai
Ye hai duniya yahan kitne aehle wafa
Bewafa ho gaye dekhte dekhte
Gair ki baat 'Tasleem' kya kijie
Ab to Khud par bhi humko bharosa nahin
Apna saya samajhte the jinko kabhi
Wo juda ho gaye dekhte dekhte

Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan (13 October 1948 – 16 August 1997) was a Pakistani musician, primarily a singer of Qawwali, the devotional music of the Sufis. Widely considered one of the greatest voices ever recorded, he possessed an extraordinary range of vocal abilities and could perform at a high level of intensity for several hours.

He is popularly known as ""Shahenshah-e-Qawwali"", meaning ""The King of Qawwali"". Born in Faisalabad, Khan had his first public performance at the age of 16, at his father's chelum. He became the head of the family qawwali party in 1971. He was signed by Oriental Star Agencies, Birmingham, England.

Welcome to Brandy's official YouTube channel, home of 90s R&B classics “I Wanna Be Down,” “Baby,” “Have You Ever,” “Brokenhearted” and her Grammy Award winning duet with Monica “The Boy Is Mine.” With the successes of her multi-platinum albums ‘Brandy,’ ‘Never Say Never’ and her third album ‘Full Moon,’ Brandy Norwood received the nickname “The Vocal Bible” for her distinct tone, intricate runs, and the way she harmonizes to create a vocal symphony. The multi-talented singer, songwriter, actress, and producer has inspired many artists in the R&B, pop, and gospel genres as well as African American actors in film, television, and on Broadway.

TOTALMENTE SEU
(Marisa Monte/Lucas Silva/Lucio Silva)

Eu levo a sério
Não brinca assim
Não faz assim comigo
Sou totalmente seu

Não nego, confesso
Gostar de alguém
Tem sempre algum perigo
Sou 100% seu

Se vai dar pé 
Ou não vai dar jeito
O tempo irá dizer
Só sei que agora é forte, perfeito
Sou totalmente seu

Eu levo a sério
Não fica assim
Não faz assim comigo
Sou totalmente seu

Não nego, confesso
Ficar com alguém
Envolve um certo risco
Sou 100% seu

Se vai dar certo
Ou não vai ter jeito
O tempo irá dizer
Só sei que agora é forte, perfeito
Sou totalmente seu

Udo L. und Kommissarin Lindholm aka Maria Furtwängler!! Was für ein Powerteam! Erst nahm er sie mit auf die Bühne und auf Tour, jetzt drehen sie gemeinsam oscarverdächtige Filme - ja okay, erstmal nur einen. 

Denn auf ganz geheimnisvolle Weise ist das Musikvideo zum neuen Udo-Song auch mit dem Tatort verwoben.. und schon ein kleiner Vorgeschmack auf den Film, in dem das Lied ""Kompass"" eine nicht ganz unwichtige Rolle spielt. Den gibt's zwar erst am Jahrensende zu sehen - aber das Video zum Song schon HEUTE, yeahhh!! Here we go, Hamburg by night..

Für jeden von uns. Langsam und endgültig bewegen sich die Zeiger vorwärts. Für alle der Anlass, auch mal eine Zwischenbilanz zu ziehen, kurz haltzumachen auf der Brücke, die vom Gestern ins Morgen führt...Für einen Mann wie UDO LINDENBERG wird solch ein Innehalten zu einem ganz außergewöhnlichen Kunstwerk: Es heißt „Wieder genauso“ und ist das Bekenntnis, mit sich selbst im Einklang zu sein, „Ich würd’s wieder genauso tun, genauso wie es war.“ Dieses Gelöbnis wird gleichzeitig ein hoffnungsfroher Ausblick in die Zukunft – wenn die Elementarteilchen der Vergangenheit mit all den falschen Wegen und trügerischen Abbiegungen die Basis einer glorreichen neuen Zeit werden können. Genauso tun, genauso tun, wie’s war.

Gleichermaßen gelingt es in dem Video, die berührenden Lyrics und die Komposition zu diesem Song in bewegende Bilder umzusetzen. Metaphern des Lebens, die die Bunte Republik Deutschland gezeichnet haben. Die Begegnung mit Willy Brandt. Das Aufeinandertreffen mit Honecker, das große Finale der spektakulären Konzerte. Vielleicht ist es noch in keinem von UDO LINDENBERGs Videos gelungen, die Poesie der Worte ein paar Minuten lang lyrisch so kongenial zu bebildern, wie in diesem. Bis hin zum Finale, wenn der Weg ins gleißende Licht nicht das Ende einer Geschichte bedeuten muss, sondern auch den triumphalen Anfang einer Bühnenshow, die Zehntausende glücklich macht.

Ich bin wieder zu Hause und was ich auch mach'
ich denk' immer nur, nur an Dich.
Nein, ich hab' nicht gewusst, dass das alles so stark ist
und irgendwie verfolgt es mich.

Und jetzt bin ich total perplex,
Dein Gesicht und Dein süsser Sex
lässt mich einfach nicht mehr in Ruh'
und ich vermiss' Dich

Wir ganz locker am Airport und ich sag' ganz leger:
Eh, man sieht sich wieder, vielleicht nächstes Jahr.
Doch dann später im Flieger wurd' das Herz mir so schwer
und es wurd' mir klar, dass es viel mehr war

Als nur so'n kleiner Flirt am Rand,
als nur 'ne schnelle Romanze am Strand.
Ist alles erst 'n paar Stunden her
und ich vermiss' Dich so sehr

Dich wiederseh'n - ich muss Dich wiederseh'n
Dich wiederseh'n - ganz schnell wiederseh'n
Dich wiederseh'n - bitte einmal noch und dann immer wieder.

Mit seiner ""MTV Unplugged - Live aus dem Hotel Atlantic""-Show schrieb Udo Lindenberg erneut Musikgeschichte: Zur Krönung holte Mastermind Udo im Juni 2011 mehr als ein Dutzend der besten zeitgenössischen Rock- und Popkünstler in die Hamburger Kulturfabrik Kampnagel, um live und unplugged in seinem ""Wohnzimmer"" des Atlantic Hotels – originalgetreu nachgebaut - über 200 Minuten lang Musik zu machen. Weitere Gäste waren Jan Delay, Clueso, Jennifer Rostock, Inga Humpe, Stefan Raab, Frida Gold, Max Herre, u.a.
Das Konzert wurde am 02. und 03 Juni 2011 auf Kampnagel in Hamburg aufgezeichnet. Regie: Sven Haeusler. Musikalische Leitung: Andreas Herbig, Henrik Menzel, Peter ""Jem"" Seifert.

Lyrics:

I try but I can't seem to get myself to think of anything but you
Your breath on my face your warm, gentle kiss I taste the truth, I taste the truth
We know what I came here for
So I won't ask for more

I wanna be with you
If only for a night
To be the one who's in your arms to hold you tight
I wanna be with you
There's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way
I wanna be with you",True,True,32225504.0,pop music

Lyrics:

I'm so addicted 
To the loving that you're feeding to me 
Can't do without it. 
This feeling's got me weak in the knees 
Body's in withdrawal 
Every time you take it away 
Can't you hear me calling 
Begging you to come out and play? 
So baby come to me 
Show me who you are 
Sweet to me 
Like sugar to my heart 
oooh baby 
I'm craving for you 
I'm missing you like candy 
Sweet sweet loving 
Got me going to the extreme 
Won't go without it 
This vibe has gotta hold on me 
Satisfying baby 
Let me show what i'm made of 
No doubt about it 
Got me feeling crazy can't get enough.",True,True,25343174.0,teen pop

Letras:

Nossa história foi assim
Um olhar, um beijo e mais
Fomos bem mais que só um
E agora quer mudar, conter esse desejo
Aonde nós chegamos

Queria tanto que você fizesse parte da minha loucura
No carro, na rua, na areia do mar
Queria tanto com você uma aventura toda madrugada
Sem hora marcada, sem limite pra amar",True,True,24886358.0,Not Found

Letra: 
De repente você chega
Revirando a minha vida
Cheia de amor pra dar
Pra falar de um sentimento
Que até bem pouco tempo
Você quis me bagunçar

Quando eu penso estar curado
Eu te vejo do meu lado
Louca pra me dominar
Pra fugir dos teus encantos
Procurei outros carinhos
Vou tentando me encontrar

Eu já fiz até promessas
Já tentei todas as rezas
Peço a Deus pra me ajudar
Num remédio pro meu peito
Que consiga dar um jeito
De você me libertar

Eu não consigo te esquecer
Eu tenho medo de voltar
Mas a vontade de te ver supera
Eu não aceito te querer
Não tenho forças pra lutar
Mas a vontade de te ver supera

Eu não consigo te esquecer
Eu tenho medo de voltar
Mas a vontade de te ver supera
Eu não aceito te querer
Não tenho forças pra lutar
Mas a vontade de te ver supera

[2Pac]
Let it be prophesized; niggaz'll die because ya crew's goon
Around the way niggaz get murdered by the full moon
Heard it in whispered tones
Niggaz is bold and they choose to roll
I kill em all, watch now nigga truth be told
Westside was the war cry, look how they scatter
Niggaz dyin by my 30-yard, brains'll splatter
Wonder why these niggaz cross me
I'm certified crazy, so sick the world made me
Now diggy-die, everytime I ride it's for reasons
Hard to kill a nigga cause I'm comin back like Jesus
Bow down to my ill nation runnin from drug cases
Lookin at my congregation so full of thug faces
Momma gave a nigga breath, a life of stress
I invest in a vest and makin niggaz watch they every step
Label me a threat
and I ain't even got started with this shit yet
Thug style baby, hands on my pistol, listen I'm a ridah
Every nigga breathin pay attention
Bout to show you motherfuckers how it feel, to drop a body
The simple gun to my lifestyle, Killuminati

Chorus: Kastro + 2Pac

[Kas] Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
[Pac] Hold it down
[Kas] Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
[Pac] Hold it down

After the fire comes the rain, after pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin again
Til I make it yo; my military be prepared for them bustaz
Similar to, bitches that scary, get too near me we rushin
Visions of over-packed prisons, fiends and niggaz thug livin
Pressures and three strikes, I hope they don't test us
They pull the heater ammunition it cranks, psssh
Move without a sound, as we slide down, pistols in place
They got me fiendin for currency, the money be callin
It's like I'm - dreamin, see in season me ballin
Participated in felonious behavior
Cock the cocked fo'-five, snatchin niggaz pagers
Labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin 40's, moved to harder shit
God damn now I'm a grown man, I follow no man
Nigga got my own plan, and it's called Killuminati

Chorus (w/ minor variations)

[E.D.I. Amin]
I spend most of my time bankin niggaz
because they hate a nigga, comin across fake niggaz
But we made niggaz, old school and I'm thinkin
Y'all some bitch made niggaz and you steadily sinkin
O-U-T, L-A-W-Z ain't nuttin fuckin with that
We bustin back comin back for the stacks
Laugh last cash cash, all I want is the paper
Givin them fuckers tool whips, I rule haters
Y'all can't fade us, we kill steal and peal quickly
The boss niggaz, definitely, put it down strictly
E.D.I. Amin, until the law come for me
Kill em all for shortie, ninety-nine Killuminati

[Kadafi]
They got me thinkin strugglin and hustling's my only fate
Toppin grams on the kichen plate, tryin to keep that money straight
Times is rollin three up these streets sleep
But when I crack, hammer cocked back rapped in my sheets
My life's been crossed, crooked since a seed it hurts
Got a package from the devil, payin my deeds
Preocuppied by the greed, in this crooked life I lead
More funds to spend, or bigger guns to squeeze

Separuh nafas ku terbang
Bersama dirimu
Saat kau tinggalkanku
...salahkanku

Salahkah aku
Bila aku bukanlah
Seperti aku yang dahulu

Ada makna tergali... dari sini
dari pertikaian yang terjadi...

Kau hancurkan diriku...
Bila kau tinggalkan aku...
Kau Dewiku...
Kembalilah padaku
Bawa separuh nafasku
Kau Dewiku...

Lirik Dewa 19 - Selimut Hati

Aku kan menjadi malam-malammu.
Kan menjadi mimpi-mimpimu
Dan selimuti hatimu.yang beku.
Aku kan menjadi bintang-bintangmu.
Kan slalu menyinarimu.
Dan menghapus rasa rindumu yang pilu.

Aku bisa untuk menjadi apa yang kau minta.
Untuk menjadi apa yang kau impikan

Tapi ku tak bisa menjadi dirinya.

Aku kan menjadi embun pagimu.
Yang kan menyejukkan jiwamu.
Dan kan membasuh hatimu yang layu
Aku bisa untuk menjadi apa yang kau minta.
Untuk menjadi apa yang kau impikan
Tapi ku tak bisa menjadi dirinya.

Tinggalkan sejenak lalumu.
beri s'dikit waktu.
Kepadaku tuk meyakinkanmu...
Aku kan menjadi malam-malammu.
Kan menjadi mimpi-mimpimu
Dan selimuti hatimu.
selimuti hatimu...
selimuti hatimu...
selimuti hatimu ...

Tatap matamu bagai busur panah
Yang kau lepaskan ke jantung hatiku
Meski kau simpan cintamu masih
Tetap nafasku wangi hiasi suasana

Saat kau kecup manis bibirmu
Cintaku tak harus, miliki dirimu
Meski perih mengiris-iris segala janji
Aku berdansa diujung gelisah

Di iringi syahdu lembut lakumu
Kau sebar benih anggun jiwamu
Namun kau tiada...menuai buah cintaku
Yang ada…

Lirik The Rock - Aku Cinta Kau Dan Dia

Hancur hatiku, mengenang dikau
Menjadi keping-keping, setelah kau pergi
Tinggalkan kasih sayang
yang pernah singgah, antara kita
Masihkah ada, sayang itu

Memang salahku, yang tak pernaha
Meninggalkan dirinya, 'tuk bersama kamu
Walau 'tuk t'rus bersama
'kan ada hati, yang 'kan terluka
Masihkah ada, sayang itu/Dan ku tahu, kau tak mau

Sekali lagi maafkanlah
karena aku, cinta kau dan dia
Maafkanlah, ku taka
tinggalkan dirinya

Mungkin tak mungkin, 'tuk terus bersama
Jalani semua cinta, yang t'lah dijalani
Tapi bila itu yang
kau pikir yang ter-baik untukmu
Bahagiaku, untuk dirimu

Simpan sisa-sisa, cerita cinta berdua
Walau tak tersisa, cerita cinta berdua
Still I have, in my eyes
Still I have forever

In 1993, Sean “Puff Daddy” Combs, also known as Diddy, launched Bad Boy Records. Nobody could have
imagined the impact the label would have on pop culture. As a subsidiary of the larger Bad Boy
Entertainment, the label became best known for its signature sound of streetwise hip-hop soul and the
ghetto fabulousness that radiated like precious jewels from its very name. Bad Boy was designed for
those who aspired higher, but also wanted to party until the break of dawn. Puffy had seen life from
both sides of the class divide and, with his groove-heavy music, worked hard to merge the two. There is
no better visual embodiment of this merger than the groundbreaking videos that were in heavy rotation
on BET and MTV and now on YouTube.

The Bad Boy Entertainment channel is the official YouTube home of iconic music videos from Puff
Daddy, Craig Mack, Faith Evans, 112, Total, Mase, Yung Joc, Cassie, Danity Kane, and the rest of the Bad
Boy Family, and your destination for some of the biggest 90s and 00s hip-hop hits of all time like Craig
Mack’s “Flava In Your Ear (Remix)”, the Notorious B.I.G. tribute “I’ll Be Missing You” by Puff Daddy feat.
Faith Evans and 112, and Cassie – “Me & U”.

Fo real, dont stop
(And I like it, I, I)
H World dont stop
(And I like it, I, I)
M. Betha, dont stop
(And I like it, I, I)

They wanna roll like me, do a show like me
Wanna jump in the ferrari and roll like me
But I know who I be, wit no ID
So much money think the bank owe me
Yo, I do the thing now what you wanna do?
I make the music that you want with ya boo
Go away bring back somethin just for you
Cant no man stop what we come to do
I been flyin all week, I land for a day
Sit somewhere so I can plan my day
I take you to somewhere like Sandro Pe'
And you though I said San Jose? No way
Come on, you know I wouldnt lead you wrong and
You know I wouldnt lead you on and
If everybody tellin you to keep it off
Who gon say keep it on? Come on

We dont have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no
We can just chill and kick it all night (kick it all night)
Cause it feels so right (feels so right) cause it feels so right

Uh, we dont stop
I tell those, girls in Melrose
That love Chanel clothes
To keep they legs closed
The way we met, gave you major respect
I move bodies like I wave the tech
I make all the young girls stomp like a majorette
You need lights to engage in sex
And just because you got the best ride
Dont mean you the best guy
Like the car, you cant let everybody test drive
And I know you like expensive trips
Expensive whips, and spendin chips
The drink you drink is an expensive sip
I just bought a home in an expensive zip
And ever since I met you it havent been dark since
Hold your hands by a central park bench
Twenty million just for the apartment
No financin tell me when your heart went

We dont have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no
We can just chill and kick it all night (kick it all night)
Cause it feels so right (feels so right) cause it feels so right so right
And I like it, (you know I like it) and I like it
And I like it, (I know you like it) I, I
And I like it, (I know they like it) and I like it
And I like it, (Yeah I like it) I, I
And I like it, (I know you like it) and I like it
And I like it, (You know I like it) I, I
And I like it, (Come on, come on, come on) and I like it
And I like it, (Come on, come on) I, I

Now we can just dance, all I need is a chance
To meet ya old man and go and meet ya whole fam
Aint tryin to weaken ya stance, with a weekend in France
I wanna pay all ya bills like a week in advance
Im not a rude dude that'll reach for ya hand
And if ya tell him no then he'll understand
Even though, everywhere he go he in demand
And gotta give you no E to try to sneak in ya pants

We dont have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no
We can just chill and kick it all night (kick it all night)
Cause it feels so right (feels so right) cause it feels so right

Descontrolado

Dijiste que me querías
Dijiste que no te irías
Y no no no, no era cierto
Y es que tu nunca me has querido

Yo yo yo, soy como un perro
Que abandonaste en el camino
Estoy abandonado maltratado herido
Como un perro me has dejado al lado del camino

Me estoy emborrachando pa´ ver si te olvido
Ahogándome y perdiéndome y no lo consigo
Dijiste que aquí estarías
Conmigo toda la vida

Y no no no, no era cierto
Y es que tu nunca me has querido
Yo yo yo, soy como un perro
Que abandonaste en el camino

Estoy abandonado maltratado herido
Como un perro me has dejado al lado del camino
Me estoy emborrachando pa´ ver si te olvido
Ahogándome y perdiéndome y no lo consigo

Estoy abandonado maltratado herido
Como un perro me has dejado al lado del camino
Estoy descontrolado abrazado a mi pena
Como un perro abandonado y tu ni me recuerdas

Estoy abandonado maltratado herido
Como un perro me has dejado al lado del camino
Me estoy emborrachando pa´ ver si te olvido
Ahogándome y perdiéndome y no lo consigo

Estoy abandonado maltratado herido
Como un perro me has dejado al lado del camino
Estoy descontrolado abrazado a mi pena

Letra:
A Veces Lloro

Hoy entendí que no soy nada
Para ti finges siempre y eso duele
¿Qué piensas tú?
Que mi amor es común
No cariño yo soy mas de lo que aceptas

¿Qué piensas tú?
Abre los ojos por favor
Estoy llorando y el dolor aumenta día con día

Y a veces lloro y no sé que hacer
Tu recuerdo me hiere
Haz sido
Muy cruel

Pero yo sé que me vas a recordar
Cuando pidas amor y te sientas muy mal
Me lastima, me lastima
Tu indecisión

Ahora me voy
No estoy seguro sí este amor
Se borrara tan fácil, oh, de mi mente
Quiero dormir
Para calmar este dolor
Y olvidarme de este amor
Ya estoy demente

Y a veces lloro y no se que hacer
Tu recuerdo me hiere
Haz sido muy cruel

Pero yo sé que me vas a recordar
Cuando pidas amor y te sientas muy mal
Me lastima, me lastima
Tu indecisión

Y a veces lloro y no se que hacer
Tu recuerdo me hiere

Letra
Acuérdate De Mí

Acuérdate de mí
cuando te encuentres sola
y sientas frio en el alma
y te falte la calma.

Acuérdate de mí
cuando pongas a volar
tus pensamientos por la noche
buscando felicidad.

Acuérdate de mi
cuando sientas el dolor atroz
del desamor
y tu frente no brille más.

Acuérdate de mí
cuando escuches esta canción
que pregunte por ti,
de tu soledad.

Acuérdate de mí
cuando te encuentres por la calle
ojos que te miren con ternura
iluminando tu corazón.

Acuérdate de mi
cuando te encuentres lejos
y bajo en árbol recuerdes
donde estuvimos tú y yo.

Ya voy acercándome a ti
El tiempo se agota, pronto cae la tarde
Enciendo las luces al fin

Miro su cadera y los números necios
me dicen que hay infracción

Pero voy contento, ya estoy regresando
en todo este tiempo te estuve extrañando,
Vivía de recuerdos en la lejanía
Siempre amándote a ti.

Traigo las maletas llenas de ilusiones
Y los sentimientos llenos de emociones
Estando tan lejos tu me hiciste falta
Estoy regresando a ti

Pasan los recuerdos, pasan los paisajes
Ya voy acercándome a ti

Lyrics
When routine bites hard
And ambitions are low
And resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads


Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again


Why is the bedroom so cold?
You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed?
Our respect runs so dry
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives


But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again


You cry out in your sleep
All my failings exposed
And there's a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold
Just that something so good
Just can't function no more


Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Then love, love will tear it apart again
Love, love will tear it apart again",True,True,319417413.0,synth-pop

Lyrics:
I've been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand,
Could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man?
These sensations barely interest me for another day,
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, take the shock away.

It's getting faster, moving faster now, it's getting out of hand,
On the tenth floor, down the back stairs, it's a no man's land,
Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now,
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it out somehow.

What means to you, what means to me, and we will meet again,
I'm watching you, I'm watching her, I'll take no pity from your friends,
Who is right, who can tell, and who gives a right now,
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know,
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know,
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know,
I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling,
I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling.

Lyrics

Radio, live transmission
Radio, live transmission


Listen to the silence, let it ring on
Eyes, dark grey lenses frightened of the sun
We would have a fine time living in the night
Left to blind destruction, waiting for our sight


And we would go on as though nothing was wrong
And hide from these days we remained all alone
Staying in the same place, just staying out the time
Touching from a distance, further all the time


Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio


Well I could call out when the going gets tough
The things that we've learnt are no longer enough
No language, just sound, that's all we need know
To synchronise love to the beat of the show
And we could dance


Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio

Lyrics:
Confusion in her eyes that says it all.
She's lost control.
And she's clinging to the nearest passer by,
She's lost control.

And she gave away the secrets of her past,
And said I've lost control again,
And a voice that told her when and where to act,
She said I've lost control again.

And she turned around and took me by the hand and said,
I've lost control again.
And how I'll never know just why or understand,
She said I've lost control again.

And she screamed out kicking on her side and said,
I've lost control again.
And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die.
She said I've lost control.

She's lost control again.
She's lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.

Well I had to 'phone her friend to state my case,
And say she's lost control again.
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes,
And said I've lost control again.

But she expressed herself in many different ways,
Until she lost control again.
And walked upon the edge of no escape,
And laughed I've lost control.

She's lost control again.
She's lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.",True,True,49416451.0,gothic rock

Lyrics:
To the centre of the city where all roads meet, waiting for you,
To the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank, searching for you,
I was moving through the silence without motion, waiting for you,
In a room with a window in the corner I found truth.

In the shadowplay, acting out your own death, knowing no more,
As the assassins all grouped in four lines, dancing on the floor,
And with cold steel, odour on their bodies made a move to connect,
But I could only stare in disbelief as the crowds all left.

I did everything, everything I wanted to,
I let them use you for their own ends,
To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you,
To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you.",True,True,45447935.0,gothic rock

Lyrics:
I walked through the city limits,
Someone talked me in to do it,
Attracted by some force within it,
Had to close my eyes to get close to it,
Around a corner where a prophet lay,
Saw the place where she'd a room to stay,
A wire fence where the children played.
Saw the bed where the body lay,
And I was looking for a friend of mine.
And I had no time to waste.
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.

The cars screeched hear the sound on dust,
Heard a noise just a car outside,
Metallic blue turned red with rust,
Pulled in close by the building's side,
In a group all forgotten youth,
Had to think, collect my senses now,
Are turned on to a knife edged view.
Find some places where my friends don't know,
And I was looking for a friend of mine.
And I had no time to waste.
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.

Down the dark streets, the houses looked the same,
Getting darker now, faces look the same,
And I walked round and round.
No stomach, torn apart,
Nail me to a train,
Had to think again,
Trying to find a clue, trying to find a way to get out!
Trying to move away, had to move away and keep out.

Four, twelve windows, ten in a row,
Behind a wall, well I looked down low,
The lights shined like a neon show,
Inserted deep felt a warmer glow,
No place to stop, no place to go,
No time to lose, had to keep on going,
I guessed they died some time ago.
I guessed they died some time ago.
And I was looking for a friend of mine.
And I had no time to waste.
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.

Lyrics

Walk in silence
Don't walk away, in silence

See the danger
Always danger
Endless talking
Life rebuilding
Don't walk away


Walk in silence
Don't turn away, in silence

Your confusion
My illusion
Worn like a mask of self-hate
Confronts and then dies
Don't walk away

People like you find it easy
Naked to see
Walking on air
Hunting by the rivers
Through the streets
Every corner abandoned too soon
Set down with due care


Don't walk away, in silence
Don't walk away",True,True,48491142.0,punk rock
