Lyrics:

Tomorrow I'm gonna leave here
I'm gonna let you go and walk away like every day I said I would
And tomorrow, I'm gonna listen
To that voice of reason inside my head telling me that we're no good

But tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you
You're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow""",True,True,94827093.0,Not Found

Lyrics:

Tuxedo waiters, black tie,
White table clothes and red wine,
We've been planning, this night,
Looking forward to it, for some time
Now honey I know you love getting dressed up,
And you know I love showing you off,
But watching your baby blue eyes,
Dancing in the candle light glow,
All I can think about, is getting you home
Walking through the front door,
Seeing your black dress hit the floor,
Uh honey there sure ain't nothing, like you loving
Me all night long, and all I can think about is getting you home",True,True,85151710.0,Not Found

Before I got to the door.

Lyrics:
We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you

Lyrics:

I've been a rolling stone all my life
Flying all alone, flying blind
I've seen it all, I've been around
I've been lost and I've been found but

Who I am with you is who I really want to be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you, it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you

I've got a ways to go on this ride
But I got a hand to hold that fits just right
You make me laugh, you make me high,
You make me want to hold on tight, 'cause""

Lyrics:

The bluest skies don't seem so blue
And the stars seem to be a little dimmer too
Now that you're around you put 'em all to shame
Let me break it downcause what I'm trying to say is

No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you

Song Lyrics:
Sapno Mein Aii Ke Jai Ke
O Ri Goriya
Humri Churai Le Neendiya
Sapno Mein Aii Ke Jai Ke
O Ri Goriya
Humri Churai Le Neendiya
Humpe Girai Ke Haaye Re Tu Bijuriya
Humse Churai Le Humka

Baharon Mein Tu Hai
Nazaron Mein Tu Hai
Dekhon Jidhar Mein Wahan Tu Dekhai De
Prem Ki Naiya Hai Ram Ke Bharose
Apni Bhi Naiya Ko Paar Tu Lagai De
Prem Ki Naiya Hai Ram Ke Bharose
Apni Bhi Naiya Ko Paar Tu Lagai De

Haan Katte Katte Kat Na Jaye
Bina Hi Pyaar Ko Paaye
Dekho Meri Sari Hi Umar Karun Mein Kya
Kahin To Hoga Koi Upaaye
Ki Meri Tu Ho Jaye
Chahe Mujhko Tu Bhi Umar Bhar
Karun Mein Kya
Kya Mantar Padhu Mein
Kya Tantar Karu Mein
Aankhon Ki Chahat Tujhe Bhi Dekhai De
Prem Ki Naiya Hai Ram Ke Bharose
Apni Naaiya Ko Paar Tu Lagai De
Prem Ki Naiya Hai Ram Ke Bharose
Apni Bhi Naiya Ko Paar Tu Lagai De

Dil Ko Dil Ki Prem Kahani
Jaruri Hui Sunani
Dil Baat Kaise Mein Kahun
Karun Mein Kya
Samjhe Na Tu Baat Woh Pagali
Ki Dil Ki Adala Badli
Abb To Bin Kiya Na Mein Rahun
Karun Mein Kya
Mein Rah Bhi Na Pau
Mein Keh Bhi Na Pau
Bole Bina Kaise Tujhko Sunai De
Prem Ki Naiya Hai Ram Ke Bharose
Apni Bhi Naiya Ko Paar Tu Lagai De
Prem Ki Naiya Hai Ram Ke Bharose
Apni Bhi Naiya Ko Paar Tu Lagai De

Sapno Mein Aii Ke Jai Ke
O Ri Goriya
Humri Churai Le Neendiya
Humpe Girai Ke Haaye Re Tu Bejuriya
Humse Churai Le Humka
Baharon Mein Tu Hai 
Nazaron Mein Tu Hai 
Dekhon Jidhar Mein Wahan Tu Dekhai De

Prem Ki Naiya Hai Ram Ke Bharose
Apni Bhi Naiya Ko Paar Tu Lagai De
Prem Ki Naiya Hai Ram Ke Bharose

ZUKUNFT PINK // Lyrics 

Alle malen schwarz, ich seh’ die Zukunft pink 
Wenn du mich fragst, wird alles gut mein Kind
(Mmmm… Utopia City go…)

Rolle vor im Transit Pod,
die Sonne scheint auf die Blocks, 
Hab’ meinen Avatar gekillt, 
Weil ich selber auf die Party will 

Alle Almans können die Moves
Oder sie programmieren die Boots, 
Die AI weiß doch was sie tut,
Das Gras ist grün und schmeckt gut

Schwarz, weiß, straight, gay, 
Liebe für alle und für mich selbst, 
Power to the people,
Frauen rulen die Welt 

Seh’ die Zukunft pink, Zukunft pink, 
Alles gut mein Kind, ja, alles gut mein Kind.

Alle malen schwarz, ich seh’ die Zukunft pink 
Wenn du mich fragst, wird alles gut mein Kind,
Mach dein Ding, aber such kein´ Sinn
und was nicht da ist, musst du erfinden,

Oh ja, ich seh’ die Zukunft pink 
Wenn du mich fragst, wird alles gut mein Kind,
Binge Pink Mirror und dazu ein Drink, 
Eis Pink Grapefruit und Gin 
Eis Pink Grapefruit und Gin 

Elon Musk, **** dein Mars Projekt
Scheiß kalt und arsch weit weg, 
Hab Brandenburg entdeckt 
Bianchi Bikes = future flex

Alles wird super geil, basta 
Frische Musik, frisches Wasser
Alle sind cool mit den Nachbarn 
Tax me now ! I’m a rich motherfucker !

Do it yourself, Bauhaus, 
Keiner braucht bissige Wau-Waus
Viehbauern lassen die Sau raus, 
Gibt billige Buden in Downtown 

Ich mal Smileys auf den Weg, 
Denn ich mag, was ich seh’
Der Himmel ist immer noch blau, 
Meine Süßen: Future is now !

Alle malen schwarz, ich seh’ die Zukunft pink 
Wenn du mich fragst, wird alles gut mein Kind,
Mach dein Ding, aber such kein´ Sinn
und was nicht da ist, musst du erfinden,

Oh ja, ich seh’ die Zukunft pink 
Wenn du mich fragst, wird alles gut mein Kind,
Binge Pink Mirror und dazu ein Drink, 
Eis Pink Grapefruit und Gin, 
Weil wir die Zukunft sind, 
seh’ ich die Zukunft pink

LETRA:
 
Si ella supiera 
Que por las noches bailas conmigo 
A la luz de los faros de un coche 
Con la luna de único testigo 
 
Que tú me elevas 
Y que en tus brazos me llevas al cielo  
Cada vez que se escapa un “te amo”  
El tiempo se vuelve de hielo.  
 
Si ella supiera que en cada palabra que sale de tu boca  
Mi voz se cuela…  
 
Ay Dios, si ella supiera lo que hacemos los dos.  
Ay Dios, si ella supiera lo que hacemos tú y yo,  
Si ella supiera que estando contigo  
Desaparece todo lo prohibido  
Si ella supiera que pueden amarse dos desconocidos.  
 
Provocaste un seísmo que lo pudo sentir 
hasta el niño inocente que aún habita en mi 
El espejo no miente, me veo diferente  
Y aunque suene injusto y cruel, 
No sospecha nada, de que estoy contigo  
De que mi universo comienza en tu pecho y 
Termina en tu ombligo…  
Si ella supiera que en cada palabra que sale de tu boca  
Mi voz se cuela…  
 
Ay Dios, si ella supiera lo que hacemos los dos.  
Ay Dios, si ella supiera lo que hacemos tú y yo,  
Si ella supiera que estando contigo  
Desaparece todo lo prohibido  
Si ella supiera que pueden amarse dos desconocidos.  
 
Déjame recorrer tu cuerpo con mi boca, 
Deja la lengua arder como un volcán   
Si sobra hasta la piel, qué hacemos con la ropa?  
al abrazarte fuerte puedo volar 
 
Dejemos que la Magia nos venga a ver  
Entrelazados a mil metros del suelo 
Que no nos quede nada por esconder, 
Y que se entere el mundo que por ti me muero.",True,True,179230151.0,Not Found

LETRA:

Me enamoré de tu alma, tu prisa, tu calma
Tu ruido en la noche que me hace reír
Termino en tus brazos, tu amor a distancia
Porque no hay distancia que me aleje de ti

Estaba con el cora herido, odiando a Cupido
Nadando perdido pa' ahogarme en el alcohol
Recuerdo esa noche, en esa tormenta
Verte llegar fue como ver salir el sol

Seguro que me enamoré
Me enamoré con los 5 sentíos
Me gusta todo lo que soy contigo
Y apriétame y desnúdame hasta el corazón

Me enamoré, me enamoré de lo que hemos vivío
Yo quiero cada instante repetío
Si mi vestido con más nadie convino
Como lo hizo contigo

Te juro que si me dejas
Mami no te dejo sola
Tú y yo somos diferentes
Pero eso es lo que me mola
Tú de Prada y yo de Off White
Eso nos hace más guay
Si se nos filtra un video
Coge más streams que Ibai

Que nos sobra la ropa
Si miro tu boca, la quiero besar de una vez
Cuando tenía la batalla perdida (Sí, Sí)
Llegaste pa'que la ganara, Mi Niña

Que te quiero, te amoy te todo
Que no quiero vivir de otro modo
Que yo quiero un laíto en tu cama
Las llaves de casa, sentarme a beber frente a la ventana
El cafecito en la mañana

Seguro que me enamoré
Me enamoré con los 5 sentíos
Me gusta todo lo que soy contigo
Y apriétame y desnúdame hasta el corazón

Me enamoré, me enamoré de lo que hemos vivío
Yo quiero cada instante repetío
Si mi vestido con más nadie convino
Como lo hizo contigo
Con nadie más...

Seguro que me enamoré
Me enamoré con los 5 sentíos
Me gusta todo lo que soy contigo
Y apriétame y desnúdame hasta el corazón

Me enamoré, me enamoré de lo que hemos vivío
Yo quiero cada instante repetío

LETRA:

La primavera asoma y yo no soy capaz de verla
Se me borran los recuerdos donde tú apareces
Entendí que hay cosas que no basta con quererlas
Por más que ayer nos quisimos hoy se desvanece

De lo que fue nuestro mundo ya no queda nada
Y la foto de aquel viaje no se nos parece
Y aunque tengo claro que eres página pasada
De repente, siento tanto miedo de perderte

Quiero verte y a la misma vez
Quiero verme lejos de tus pasos
Ya no soy, no soy esa mujer
Que se muere por dormir entre tus brazos

Quiero verte aunque sabemos bien
Que lo nuestro terminó hace rato
Yo lo siento y sé que tú también
Pero dime ¿quién se atreve a dar el paso...?

Cada día me despierto con nuestras canciones
Y apagar la radio nunca me sirve de nada
Respirar no significa llenar los pulmones
Y el amor no se alimenta solo de palabras

Acunamos demasiado tiempo la esperanza
Y al final como un bebé se nos quedó dormida
Fuimos cisnes pero solo nos faltó la danza
Y ahora el baile que nos queda huele a despedida

Quiero verte y a la misma vez
Quiero verme lejos de tus pasos
Ya no soy, no soy esa mujer
Que se muere por dormir entre tus brazos

Quiero verte aunque sabemos bien
Que lo nuestro terminó hace rato
Yo lo siento y sé que tú también
Pero dime ¿quién se atreve a dar el paso...?

Si es la hora de partir qué hago aquí todavía
Si sé que no me hace bien, qué hago yo pensando en ti
Por más que me digo que mañana es otro día
Siempre regreso al lugar donde te conocí

Que mala manía la de seguir buscando
Donde nada queda
No sé en qué estamos pensando
No sé y aunque te mire temblando

Quiero verte y a la misma vez
Quiero verme lejos de tus pasos
Ya no soy, no soy esa mujer
Que se muere por dormir entre tus brazos",True,True,1151947.0,Not Found

te siento en esta habitaciÃ³n conmigo 
teniendo tu respiraciÃ³n tan cerca 
haces que se me valla 
mis dudas sobre ti 

me acerco lentamente con mi mano 
sabiendo cual serÃ¡ nuestra respuesta 
voy sin saber lo que harÃ¡s de mi 

prefiero callarme a consefar que me haces sentir 

he abierto mis ojos 
cancelando mis enojos 
y he sentido que te tengo un poco mas 
aprovecho y me cuelo enredendote en mi pelo 
insistiendo en que me vuuelvas a buscar

Tengo marcado en el pecho 
todos los dÃ­as que el tiempo no me dejÃ³ estar aquÃ­. 
Tengo una fe que me apura, 
que va conmigo y me cura desde que te conocÃ­. 
Tengo una huella perdida 
entre tu sombra y la mÃ­a que no me deja mentir. 
Soy una moneda en la fuente, 
tÃº mi deseo pendiente, mis ganas de revivir. 

Tengo una maÃ±ana constante 
y una acuarela esperando verte pintado de azul. 
Tengo tu amor y tu suerte 
y un caminito empinado, tengo el mar del otro lado, 
tÃº eres mi norte y mi sur.

Lyrics:

Look I'm comin straight out of Slauson, a crazy mother****er name Nipsey!
I'm turfed up cause I grew up in the Sixties!
Caution! To you rap *****s try and diss me!
I go hard that's why yo' ***** wanna flip me
Big guns *****s turn rivals into rosaries
Extended clips I give a **** who you 'posed to be
Straight off the block I sold dope to buy groceries
Now it's rap money no advance it's all royalties
You broke ***** you could follow me
It's **** *****es get money keep some hollow tips logically
And I'm from where homicide boost the economy
Pay taxes to these corners and put in work it's a policy
It's white chalk on the corners
It's yellow tape on the gates... choppers up above
That's Cause and turnin Loc's runs the streets where I'm from

This is just a small introduction to this Nipsey Hussle music
Plus money and *****es that's the way that we do it
First get 'yo grind on, then get yo' shine on
We come through daytime with the lights on
Now hit the fast lane, and let yo' chain swang
You gettin dollars like a doctor but you gangbang
Yeah! It's Hussle in the house
Yeah! It's Hussle in the house

Yeah, this your life, you can play with it
You make your bed, you gon' lay in it
Do your thing, just be safe with it
Triple bunks in the state prison
Blue laces in my blue chucks
I ain't never gave two fucks
BET I chucked the hood up
Asking if that nigga Nip hood, what
Like I wouldn't take it to the back with you
Same nigga walk the track with you
Same nigga shot a strap with you
Same nigga bought a sack with you
Nineteen touchin' two birds
Alpinas off a few swerves
Grey leather in my white Lincoln
Shit smellin' like a new purse
Two C's on my bitch shit
My money risin' like Bisquick
Six words help you get this
Rich Rapper On Some Crip Shit
I prayed for blessings as a young nigga
Not to learn the hard lessons of a drug dealer
Triple life with a gang enhancement
The judge triple white and he hate your blackness
He slam the gavel with a racist passion
Got you waitin' on appeals but your patience passin'
All you've got to offer is a fight
It's too late to run to Christ once you caught up in this life
Look
So face the world now or cry

Look Don't cry tears, they don't fly here
And if you don't die here, you supposed to fly Lears
365 here is like a dog year
No wonder why these niggas 20 and got white hairs
Stressin' like they 40 and some change
It's lonely in this game, all my homies is in pain
And brodie is the slang, but it don't mean he your brother
It don't mean you can trust him, it don't mean that he love you
And we was raised wrong but we stayed strong
And when we kept it real, we got faked on
And when we showed up, we got flaked on
While them niggas story's gettin' cake homes
I bet my life I'm a dice shaker
Electric lights on a skyscraper
It's up and downs for a real nigga
But you'll be lame all your life, hater
MAC-10 in my black Benz
Show me signals of betrayal, can't be back friends
Long flights get my mind right
Victory to me is when you spend your time right
Victory to me is when you get your grind right
Victory to me is when you get your moms right
Niggas, got this shit twisted
Like Jean-Michel Basquiat destroyed his pictures
Self-inflicted homicide, don't pull the trigger
I feel like I got to tell you you got something to contribute
Regardless what you into, regardless what you been through
I feel like I got to tell you you got something to contribute
(Something to contribute, something to contribute)
So face the world now or cry
So face the world
So face the world
So face the world now or cry
Face the world now
So face the world now or cry
Face the world now
When all dreams seem to die
The summer's gone, the breeze stops blowing
The sun just leaves the sky
Yeah, this your life, you can play with it
You make your bed, you gon' lay in it
Do your thing, just be safe with it
Triple bunks in the state prison

""LOVE LOST"" è il nuovo singolo dei TEMPER TRAP, la band rivelazione del 2009!!! 
La band australiana si è fatta conoscere al pubblico italiano con il singolo ""SWEET DISPOSITION"", arrivato al #2 del Music Control (canzone straniera più programmata dalle radio italiane per 2 settimane!!!) all'inizio del 2010 e durante l'estate con il secondo singolo ""FADER""! Nonstante entrambi i singoli si trovino nelle programmazioni di tutte le radio, venerdì 27 agosto 2010 arriva ""LOVE LOST"" il terzo estratto dall'album ""CONDITIONS""!!! Il video sarà in rotazione su tutte le tv musicali a partire da lunedì 30 Agosto!!! 
I TEMPER TRAP sono: Dougy Mandagi (voce e chitarra), Jonathon Aherne (basso), Lorenzo Sillitto (chitarra e tastiere) e Toby Dundas (batteria). La band ha iniziato a farsi conoscere tra il 2008 e primi mesi del 2009 esibendosi in festival musicali e manifestazioni in giro per il mondo. Nel marzo del 2009 finiscono di registrare il loro album di debutto ""CONDITIONS"", prodotto da Jim Abbiss, già produttore di artisti come Arctic Monkeys e Kasabian. L'album, è una contaminazione di vari generi, che spaziano dall'indie e l'alternative rock e dal pop alla musica elettronica, la musica dei Temper Trap prende influenza principalmente da artisti come U2, Radiohead, Massive Attack e Prince. 
La band australiana dopo esser stata in concerto negli USA, Australia, UK, Germania, Svizzera, Italia (15 Giugno scorso al Circolo degli Artisti a Roma ed il 16 all'Alcatraz a Milano), sono tornati in America per un nuovo tour che toccherà oltre agli USA anche il Canada ed il Messico. A grande richiesta i TEMPER TRAP lo scorso 30 Luglio in contemporanea mondiale hanno trasmesso in webcast il loro concerto tenuto presso lo Splendour al Grass Festival. 
THE TEMPER TRAP: we shall succeed where science has failed! 

The Temper Trap, lead by frontman Dougy, have been writing and touring Australia, catching the ears of many, including world renowned producer Jim Abiss who made the journey to melbourne to assist the Temper Trap in delivering their debut record. With a series of epic new tracks set for release on their much anticipated debut album, the band has conquered adventurous new territory, building on their rich foundations in a natural progression. Legendary Artic Monkey's and Kasabian Producer Jim Abiss flew over to Melbourne to be at the helm. The Results of this brilliant new evolution in sound will persuasively draw you in. The Temper Trap have undeniably delivered. ""Love Lost"" is one their big hits, in Italy and around the world!

SEJA PARA MIM
(Tales de Polli)

Seja para mim o que você quiser
Contanto que seja o meu amor
Estou indo te buscar, mas eu tô indo a pé
Prende teu cabelo porque tá calor

Traga na tua essência teu jeito mulher
E nos teus lábios todo seu sabor
Mostre nos seus olhos que você me quer
E na tua alma todo teu valor

Quero toda calma do teu cafuné
Todas as promessas de um amor
Que seja o nosso jeito
Mesmo com defeitos
Supere os medos seus

Vamos levar a vida do jeito que der
Pegar a estrada e fazer amor
Nós dois de mãos dadas lá em São Thomé
Ou num fim de tarde no Arpoador

Eu quero que seja o que você quiser
Se fizer frio eu sou teu edredom
Se você cair eu te coloco em pé
Vou te ensinar como viver é bom

PISANDO DESCALÇO
(Tales de Polli)
 
Pisando descalço nesse chão molhado
Deito do teu lado para relaxar
Fazendo fogueira, sem eira nem beira
Deitado na esteira vendo o luar
 
Pego o meu violão
Canto uma canção que já fez maluco se por a dançar
Aquele doce
Que derrete a mente no desembaraço desse meu cantar
Aquela morena
De saia pequena com seus olhos grandes parece voar
Hoje na natureza
Não importa a feira, é dia de doideira e não de trabalhar
 
Brinco pelo espaço, estreitando laços
Eu não tenho fardos para carregar
Minha vida é plena, não faço besteira
Peço a padroeira pra me abençoar
Escuto meu coração
 
Pois a minha razão muitas vezes atrapalha o meu pensar
E ele me trouxe
O discernimento justo no momento em que pensei parar
Saí do dilema
Entre o asfalto duro e olhar paredes prefiro cantar
Hoje na natureza
Não importa a feira, é dia de doideira e não de trabalhar

O DESTINO NÃO QUIS
(Tales de Polli)

O destino não quis a gente junto pra sempre
Mas foi um privilégio me encontrar com você
Tudo aconteceu tão rápido e de repente
Mas foi suficiente pra eu nunca esquecer
Todas as risadas, todas as falas
Não foram ensaiadas, tinham de acontecer
As minhas lágrimas não foram forjadas
Prefiro o sofrer do que nunca conhecer
Teu olhar bem de perto e a força do teu beijo
Esse novo perfume do teu cheiro com o meu
Saiba que mudou o meu velho mundo pra sempre
Se eu viver outras vidas, vou lembrar de você
Imagino momentos, viajo em um tempo
Crio uma vida em que estou com você
Me sinto lento, triste e cinzento
Quando percebo que não está por aqui
Mas perto vou estar, quando lembrar
Do teu grande coração
E até sem perceber, que mesmo longe
Seremos eu e você

SAUDADES DO TEMPO
(Tales de Polli)
 
Saudades do Tempo, dos velhos momentos,
Dos anos passados que foram com o vento,
Sorrisos, lembranças, belos sentimentos,
De transformações e de renascimentos,
Praias, viagens pela madrugada,
Nossa rotina era o pé na estrada,
 
Sempre felizes sem pensar em nada,
Paisagem mais bela é o sorriso da amada,
Contava as estrelas manto prateado,
Sentia o calor de um abraço apertado,
Fazia minha boca tocar o seu lábio,
Lua iluminava com um Bob no rádio,
 
Nas manhãs nubladas, bom humor imperava,
A vida era um jogo, sem cartas marcadas,
A noite no fogo, um bom som que rolava,
Por entre a fumaça, diversas risadas,
 
Como se seus ouvidos pudessem respirar,
O som invadia o corpo, como se fosse o ar,
O som tomava forma, sensação de bem estar,
Momentos de magia, muitas formas para amar,
Marcas de batom na borda de um copo plástico,
No peito euforia, abraços, riso fácil,
E com desconhecidos, seguia, criando laços,
Transpirava alegria era dona dos seus passos,
Consciência admirável como as tintas de uma tela,
Seus olhos tinham o brilho das cores da aquarela,
Seu cabelo ao vento era a paisagem mais bela,
Tinha a complexidade de uma Vênus moderna,
Ascendeu ao azul do céu nos seus próprios pensamentos,
Não pensou no seu futuro, ela era o momento,
Vi a ponta dos seus pés no gelado do cimento,
Entre olhares meu desejo, povoar seu pensamento

ÊXODO
(Tales de Polli)

Êxodo da grande cidade
Completei maior idade
Vou morar junto do mar
Deixar pra trás velhas paisagens
Que eu trago nas tatuagens
Das lembranças de um lugar
Num arco-íris preto e branco
Sentimentos nada francos
Sorriso familiar
Quero um amor pra todo dia
Sem pensar na despedida
Pra poder voltar a sonhar

Que venha com
Cabelo solto
Sorriso fácil
Despreocupado
Dar um abraço
Poder me desligar
Linda morena
Feições amenas
Faço os meus versos
Como um poema

Sem fazer vezes pra vaidade
Eu prezo a minha liberdade
O meu direito de sonhar
Eu sei de todas desvantagens
E também de todos males
Quando a saudade apertar
Quero ser livre como vento
Intenso como o momento
De um casal sobre o altar
Dar um sentido pra minha vida
Sem viver numa mentira
Pra poder voltar a sonhar
Que venha com...

DAQUELE JEITO
(Tales de Polli)

É fim de tarde, eu tô daquele jeito
Sem pressa, bem calmo, direito
Tô devagar, eu tô sem maldade
Pirando, descalço, à vontade
Na calçada de casa, vendo a bola rolar
De longe observo você chegar
Cabelo ao vento, reparo no seu andar

Fico sem jeito
Porque eu sei do seu preconceito
Com moleque maloqueiro
Que só quer pirar
Com moleque maloqueiro
Que só quer cantar
Perna doendo por causa do futebol
Olho vermelho por causa do sol

Sou moleque maloqueiro
Que só quer pirar
Sou moleque maloqueiro
Que só quer cantar
Perna doendo por causa do futebol
Olho vermelho por causa do sol
Sou moleque maloqueiro

LEMBRANÇAS
(Tales de Polli)

São só lembranças suas tranças por entre as minhas mãos
A dança, quadris, movimento, explosão
Éramos crianças esperando anoitecer
Marionetes conduzidas pelos fios do prazer

Sua fala mansa me arde a dor de não ter
Distância que só o tempo vai percorrer

A eternidade nos teus braços era pouco pra eu entender
Que o vermelho dos teus lábios era o sangue do meu ser
Nunca fomos perfeitos

Sem aviso a vida dá, sem aviso a vida tira
Aproveite com prazer enquanto o amor ainda brilha
Não seja só lazer, não se perca pela trilha
Aproveite um bem-querer mesmo que for na despedida
Dentro de um velho quarto tentando me convencer
Que o seu rosto no retrato não vai mais envelhecer

Lyrics: Regenbogenfarben

Hast Du schon einen Regenbogen in 
Schwarz-Weiß gesehen?
Kinder, die immer nur leise sind?
Das gibt es nicht

Hast Du Träume, die Du nicht erreichen kannst?
Gefühle, die Du niemandem zeigen darfst?
Die gibt es nicht

Dreh Dich um, dann kannst Du über'n Tellerrand seh'n 
Alles bunt, musst nur ein Stückchen weiter geh'n 
Ich spiel die Luftgitarre und wir singen!

[Refrain]
Kommt lasst uns die Welt bemalen,
in Regenbogenfarben
Wir wollen sie überall
Regenbogenfarben
Kommt! Kommt! Lasst die Welt erstrahlen
In Regenbogenfarben
Man sieht sie überall
Regenbogenfahnen

Er und Er, zwei Eltern die ihr Kind zur KITA bring'n 
Sie und Sie tragen jetzt den gleichen Ring 
Alles ganz normal

Er und Sie, er schmiert die Brötchen 
die sie nach Hause bringt 
Du und ich, ganz egal wer wir auch sind.
Wir sind ganz normal!

[Refrain]

Dreh Dich um, Dann kannst Du über'n Tellerrand seh'n 
Alles bunt, musst nur ein Stückchen weiter geh'n 
Ich spiel die Luftgitarre und wir singen!

Wenn sich Helene Fischer, die erfolgreichste deutsche Sängerin unserer Zeit, und das renommierte Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in den Abbey Road Studios
in London treffen, um ein Album mit den 35 beliebtesten Weihnachtsliedern der Welt aufzunehmen, kann man zweifelsohne davon ausgehen, dass da etwas
Wundervolles entsteht. Mit dieser ganz besonderen Song-Sammlung, die pünktlich zum Weihnachtsfest erscheinen wird, macht Helene Fischer sich selbst
und ihrem Publikum ein ganz besonderes Geschenk.

Mit leuchtenden Augen werden die Zuhörer der beliebten Entertainerin auf ihrem wahrlich bezaubernden Spaziergang durch ihre ganz persönliche
Winterwunderwelt folgen. In enger Zusammenarbeit mit Star-Produzent Alex Christensen (Paul Anka, Tom Jones) ist ein festlich-weihnachtlicher Sound
der Extraklasse entstanden. „Ich fand es extrem spannend, mit Alex zusammen zu arbeiten“, so Helene. „Einem Produzenten, der schon vorher große und
Grammy-nominierte Orchester-Produktionen mit Paul Anka oder Michael Bolton gemacht hat.“

Mit viel Liebe zum Detail spannen Helene Fischer und das Royal Philharmonic Orchestra den stilistischen Bogen von fröhlich swingenden Neu-Interpretationen
beliebter internationaler Christmas-Songs über einige wunderbare Duette bis hin zu opulent arrangierten Klassikern wie „Stille Nacht“, „Ave Maria“ und
dem auf Deutsch und Latein dargebotenen „Adeste Fideles“.

Eine völlig neue Facette zeigt Helene Fischer mit großartigen Big Band-Versionen amerikanischer Christmas-Songs wie „Let It Snow“ oder „Winter Wonderland“.
Fantastischen Duett-Partnern wie den Legenden Frank Sinatra („Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas“) oder Bing Crosby („White Christmas“), aber auch
Ricky Martin („Last Christmas“), Plácido Domingo („What Child Is This“) oder Xavier Naidoo („Vom Himmel hoch, da komm‘ ich her“) verdanken wir absolute
Höhepunkte und Gänsehaut-Momente. „Es war immer ein Traum für mich, einmal mit Xavier zu arbeiten“, berichtet Helene. „Für mich ist er der Sänger mit
der schönsten Stimme Deutschlands. Und obwohl sie natürlich längst verstorben sind, ist es ein unfassbares Glück, mit Legenden wie Bing Crosby und
Frank Sinatra zu singen.“ Insgesamt umfasst die einzigartige Song-Sammlung 18 deutsche und 17 englische Songs.

Für die Aufnahmen zum Weihnachtsalbum hat Produzent Alex Christensen ein hochrangiges Ensemble der weltweit renommiertesten Musiker
zusammengestellt: angefangen beim Star-Dirigenten Paul Bateman (Andrew Lloyd Webber, Sarah Brightman) und Richard Balcombe (Sir Cliff Richard,
„Phantom Of The Opera“, „Cats“) bis hin zu namhaften Arrangeuren wie Cliff Masterson (Lionel Richie, Kylie Minogue, Oasis), Chris Walden
(Barbra Streisand, Neil Young, Michael Bublé) oder Steve Sidwell (Ex-Wham!-Bandmitglied und Arrangeur/ Komponist). Helene Fischer ist es
zweifelsohne gelungen, ein zweisprachiges Album von internationalem Format zu erschaffen. „Ich wollte all diese schönen Weihnachtslieder
einmal selbst singen und es ist großartig, mein eigenes Weihnachtsalbum zu haben. Ich kann nur hoffen, dass meine Fans die Musik ganz genauso
genießen und ich ihnen eine schöne Weihnachtszeit bescheren kann.“

Zum Release von Weihnachten erscheint das spektakuläre Weihnachtskonzert „Weihnachten – Live aus der Hofburg Wien“, bei dem Helene Fischer
ebenfalls vom Royal Philharmonic Orchestra London unterstützt wird. Das Konzert auch auf DVD erhältlich

Lyrics:
Put the minks down
No for real summertime all the freaks out
Nottingham still slapping off of 3/5
Young nigga probably beat the feds 3 times
And I kept it solid nigga each time
I’m 10 out of 10 still trying to free mines
This ain’t a regular Benz, it’s a S6
Get money fuck hoes and stretch shit
Y’all ain’t even see my best yet
I got now fuck the next nigga
I ain’t even gotta check niggas
One thing for certain, a nigga play with me he die in a hurry
50k a piece, bro fighting a murder and they retired my jersey but I still get off the bench
Glock teal with a switch still hitting licks
Everybody calling Dugg da nigga
Big homie but the littlest nigga
 
Living legend in the flesh
Had a million dollars back when I was wearing Guess
250 three times guess I had a Nina left
Hundred in the dope panel got it leaning the left
Pyrex glass handle yea shout out to my chef
Kitchen fork warm water yea shout out to myself
Send it on a paper towel but Ima need some plastic
Weight these flip those yea we doing gymnastics, on me
Count a million with my eyes close
And I can whip a whole one with a blindfold
And I can, get it to ya nigga next day, air
where ya at nigga, next day, there
Black tape nigga grey tape, seal
Street razor with the V cut, peel
God bless ya, here’s a scorpion stamp
Young Virgil Yea the off white, champ

LYRICS:

To all things housed in her silence  
Nature offers a violence  
The bear that keeps to his own line  
The wolf that seeks always its own kind  
The world that hardens as the harsher winter holds 
The parent forced to eat its young before it grows 
Every bird, gone unheard  
Starving where the ground has froze  
The winter sun rise, red on white  
Like blood upon the snow (2x)
Like Blood upon the snow  

The ground walked here is a wonder  
It ceases never to hunger  
And all things nature’s given  
She takes all things back from the living  
I’ve walked the Earth, and there are so few here that know  
How dark the night,  
And just how cold the wind can blow  
I’ve no more hunger now to see where the road will go 
I’ve no more kept my warmth  
Than blood upon the snow  
Blood upon the snow (3x) 

It’s not my arms that will fail me  
But this world takes more strength than it gave me  
The trees deny themselves nothing that makes them grow  
No rain fall, no sunshine  
No blood upon the snow  
Blood upon the snow (3x)

To all things housed in her silence  
Nature offers a violence

ABOUT GOD OF WAR:
From Santa Monica Studio and creative director Cory Barlog comes a new beginning for one of gaming’s most recognizable icons. His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive…And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat; breathtaking scale; and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest.

ABOUT BEAR MCCREARY:
Emmy® award-winning composer Bear McCreary was first launched into pop culture with his groundbreaking score to the hit series Battlestar Galactica, lauded by Variety as “the most innovative music on TV today.” Io9.com ranked McCreary one of the Ten Best Science Fiction Composers of All Time, and WIRED Magazine declared him one of only five “Secret Weapons” of the television industry. His recent projects include the  successful Universal Pictures / Blumhouse thriller-comedy Happy Death Day, the Anne Hathaway sci-fi-drama Colossal, Danny Strong’s J.D. Salinger biopic Rebel in the Rye, the acclaimed documentary Unrest, the upcoming animated film Animal Crackers, and television series such as The Walking Dead, Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Outlander, and Black Sails. His other video game credits include Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Syndicate: Jack the Ripper, Capcom’s Dark Void, Sony PlayStation’s SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy Seals, and the groundbreaking television / videogame hybrid Defiance.

ABOUT GOD OF WAR:
From Santa Monica Studio and creative director Cory Barlog comes a new beginning for one of gaming’s most recognizable icons. His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive…And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat; breathtaking scale; and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest.

ABOUT BEAR MCCREARY:
Emmy® award-winning composer Bear McCreary was first launched into pop culture with his groundbreaking score to the hit series Battlestar Galactica, lauded by Variety as “the most innovative music on TV today.” Io9.com ranked McCreary one of the Ten Best Science Fiction Composers of All Time, and WIRED Magazine declared him one of only five “Secret Weapons” of the television industry. His recent projects include the  successful Universal Pictures / Blumhouse thriller-comedy Happy Death Day, the Anne Hathaway sci-fi-drama Colossal, Danny Strong’s J.D. Salinger biopic Rebel in the Rye, the acclaimed documentary Unrest, the upcoming animated film Animal Crackers, and television series such as The Walking Dead, Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Outlander, and Black Sails. His other video game credits include Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Syndicate: Jack the Ripper, Capcom’s Dark Void, Sony PlayStation’s SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy Seals, and the groundbreaking television / videogame hybrid Defiance.

Lyrics:

There’s honey in the rock
Water in the stone
Manna on the ground
No matter where I go
I don’t need to worry
Now that I know
Everything I need You’ve got
There’s honey in the rock
 
Praying for a miracle
Thirsty for the Living Well
Only You can satisfy
 
Sweetness at the mercy seat
Now I’ve tasted, it’s not hard to see
Only You can satisfy
 
There’s honey in the rock
 
Freedom where the Spirit is
Bounty in the wilderness
You will always satisfy
 
There’s honey in the rock
Water in the stone
Manna on the ground
No matter where I go
I don’t need to worry
Now that I know
Everything I need You’ve got
 
There’s honey in the rock
Purpose in Your plan
Power in the blood
Healing in Your hands
Started flowing when You said it is done
Everything You did’s enough
 
I keep looking
I keep finding
You keep giving
Keep providing
I have all that I need
You are all that I need
 
I keep praying
You keep moving
I keep praising
You keep proving
I have all that I need
You are all that I need
 
There’s honey in the rock
Water in the stone
Manna on the ground
No matter where I go
I don’t need to worry
Now that I know
Everything I need You’ve got
 
There’s honey in the rock
Purpose in Your plan
Power in the blood
Healing in Your hands
Started flowing when You said it is done
Jesus, who You are is enough
There’s honey in the rock

BRIDGE:
Heal my heart and make it clean

Since we are surrounded 
By such a great cloud of witnesses 
Let us run let us run 
With perseverance 
The race marked out

Every generation every nation 
Every tribe every tongue 
They will sing they will cry 
Oh with one voice 
They will sing

LYRICS:

VERSE 1:
In the darkness we were waiting
Without hope without light
Till from heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes

To fulfil the law and prophets
To a virgin came the Word
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt

CHORUS:
Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit three in one
God of glory
Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

VERSE 2:
To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross

For even in Your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake You died

VERSE 3:
And the morning that You rose
All of heaven held its breath
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death

And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who’d come
To the Father are restored

VERSE 4:
And the Church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel shall not faint

By His blood and in His Name
In His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me

Lyrics:
Who else would rocks cry out to worship
Whose glory taught the stars to shine
Perhaps creation longs to have the words to sing
But this joy is mine
 
With a thousand hallelujahs
We magnify Your Name
You alone deserve the glory
The honor and the praise
Lord Jesus this song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs
And a thousand more
 
Who else would die for our redemption
Whose resurrection means I’ll rise
There isn’t time enough to sing of all You’ve done
But I have eternity to try
  
Praise to the Lord
To the Lamb
To the King of heaven
Praise for He rose
Now He reigns
We will sing forever
 
(We sing) Praise to the Lord
To the Lamb
To the King of heaven
Praise for He rose
Now He reigns

VERSE 1:
In the crushing 
In the pressing
You are making new wine
In the soil I now surrender
You are breaking new ground

PRE-CHORUS:
So I yield to You and to Your careful hand
When I trust You I don’t need to understand

CHORUS:
Make me Your vessel
Make me an offering
Make me whatever You want me to be
I came here with nothing
But all You have given me
Jesus bring new wine out of me

VERSE 2:
In the crushing
In the pressing
You are making new wine
In the soil I now surrender
You are breaking new ground

VERSE TAG:
You are breaking new ground

BRIDGE:
Where there is new wine
There is new power
There is new freedom
The Kingdom is here
I lay down my old flames
To carry Your new fire today

Awake My Soul (Live)
Words and Music by Brooke Ligertwood 
© 2019 Hillsong Music Publishing Australia  
CCLI: 7134998

There is a sound I love to hear
It’s the sound of the Saviour’s robe 
As He walks into the room where people pray
Where we hear praises He hears faith 

There is a sound I love to hear
It’s the sound of the Saviour’s robe 
As He walks into the room where people pray
Where we hear worship He hears faith
 
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud 
 
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud 

There is a sound that changes things
The sound of His people on their knees
Oh wake up you slumbering
It’s time to worship Him 

Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud 
 
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud 

And when He moves
And when we pray 
Where stood a wall now stands a way 
Where every promise is amen 

And when He moves 
Make no mistake
The bowels of hell begin to shake 
All hail the Lord all hail the King

(Hey oh)
Oh let the King of glory enter in
(You are worthy
You are holy God)
Fall down on your knees and worship Him
Let His praise rise up don't hold it in
 
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud 
 
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud 

Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud

""Greek Tragedy"" Lyrics:

We're smashing mics in karaoke bars
You're running late with half your make-up on
This method acting might pay our bills
But soon enough there'll be a different role to fill

I love this feeling
But I hate this part
I wanted this to work so much
I drew up our plans on a chart
Cars are flipping, I'm in hot pursuit
My character's strong but my head is loose

She hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me

The tarot cards say it's not so bad
And the blades rotate there's just no landing pad
And better have said it but darling you're the best
I'm just tired of falling up the Penrose steps

I hate this feeling
But I love this part
She really wants to make it work
And I clearly want to let it start
We'll build a water slide
As soon as I get home

Oh and she hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me
It's wrong but surely worse to leave
She hits like ecstasy
So free up the cheaper seats
Here comes a Greek tragedy

LYRICS

I've met someone that makes me feel seasick
Oh what a skill to have
Oh what a skill to have
So many skills that make her distinctive
But they're not mine to have
No they're not mine

Whenever she looks i read the nearest paper
Though i don't care about the soaps
No i don't care about the soaps
Though i'm acting like i'm in an Eastenders episode

If this is a rom-com
Kill the director
If this is a rom-com
Kill the director please

Carrots help us see much better in the dark
Don't talk to girls; they'll break your heart
And this is my head and this is my spout
*But* they work together; they can't figure anything out

So with the angst of a teenage band
Here's another song about a gender i'll never understand
Here's another song about a gender i'll never understand

If this is a rom-com
Kill the director
If this is a rom-com
Kill the director
If this is a rom-com
Kill the director please

LYRICS

I've just had the craziest week,
Like a party bag of lies, booze and then deceit.
And I don't know why I want to voice this out loud,
It's therapeutic somehow.

So I'm moving to New York cos I've got problems with my sleep,
And we're not the same and I will wear that on my sleeve.
So I'm moving to New York cos I've got issues with my sleep,
Looks like Christmas came early, Christmas came early for me.

I put one foot forward and ended up thirty yards back.
And am I losing touch or am I just completely off the track?
And I don't know why I want to voice this out loud,
It's therapeutic somehow.

So I'm moving to New York cos I've got problems with my sleep,
And we're not the same and I will wear that on my sleeve.
So I'm moving to New York cos I've got issues with my sleep,
Looks like Christmas came early, Christmas came early for me.

So I'm moving to New York cos I've got problems with my sleep,
And we're not the same and I will wear that on my sleeve.
So I'm moving to New York cos I've got issues with my sleep,

""If You Ever Leave, I'm Coming With You"" Lyrics:

I'm forever locking myself
In the glass of your rearview
Trying to make friends
With the friends you're close to
If you ever leave, I'm coming with you

You know I'll do
Whatever you want me to
Throw a banquet in a mosh pit
I'll get out of bed
Stop listening to Radiohead
Take you out of this
Your reluctant optimist

And if you ever leave, I'm coming with you 
Stuck to the gum that's stuck on your shoe
And if you ever leave, I'm coming with you 

I'm forever locking myself
In the glass of your rearview
Trying to make friends
With the friends you're close to
If you ever leave, I'm coming with you

Am I losing you in the dark baby?
Am I losing you in the dark baby?

No more breaking stuff
No more acting up
Filling your head with doubt
You only ever catch me out

Don't wanna be talking to myself in a supermarket
Watching myself sink into a carpet somewhere
Don't wanna end up there

So if you ever leave, I'm coming with you 
Stuck to the gum that's stuck on your shoe
If you ever leave, I'm coming with you 

I'm forever locking myself
In the glass of your rearview
Trying to make friends
With the friends you're close to
If you ever leave me, I'm coming with you

Am I losing you in the dark baby?
Am I losing you in the dark baby?

I'm forever locking myself
In the glass of your rearview
Trying to make friends
With the friends you're close to
If you ever leave me, I'm coming with you

If you ever leave me, I'm coming with you

""Is This What It Feels Like To Feel Like This"" Lyrics:

Ecstasy tragedy doom
I summon monsters to the back of your hotel
Think I might have arrived too soon
I hear the birds harmonise between your yells

I thought it would be more my style
A new bag and an overnight kit
I only ever did it once in a while
Is this what it feels like to feel like this? 

I hear the daffodils are all in bloom
I summon monsters to the door of your hotel
I might disturb the sign on your room
And smash through with the weight of the liberty bell

I thought it would be more my style
Champagne and an overnight kit
I only ever did it once in a while
Is this what it feels like to feel like this? 

And the world is a glass and it's overflown
You can self-improve but you're still on your own
And who am I to tell you what I think you should do?
Oh who am I just but just the third wheel in the room?

And we terrify each other and act obscene 
The world is just a used pinball machine
And strange fluids occupy the shine on your lips

Is this what it feels like to feel like this?

정들었던 내 젊은 날 이제는 안녕
아름답던 우리의 봄 여름 가을 겨울

“Four seasons with no reason.”
비 갠 뒤에 비애(悲哀) 대신 a happy end
비스듬히 씩 비웃듯 칠색 무늬의 무지개
철없이 철 지나 철들지 못해(still)
철부지에 철 그른지 오래 Marchin’ 비발디
차이코프스키 오늘의 사계를 맞이해
마침내 마치 넷이 못내

Boy 저 하늘만 바라보고서 
사계절 잘 지내고 있어 Good-bye 
떠난 사람 또 나타난 사람
머리 위 저세상 
난 떠나 영감의 amazon
지난 밤의 트라우마 다 묻고 
목숨 바쳐 달려올 새 출발 하는 왕복선 
변할래 전보다는 더욱더
좋은 사람 더욱더 
더 나은 사람 더욱더
아침 이슬을 맞고 내 안에 분노 과거에 묻고
For Life

울었던 웃었던 소년과 소녀가 그리워 나
찬란했던 사랑했던 그 시절만 자꾸 기억나

계절은 날이 갈수록 속절없이 흘러
붉게 물들이고 파랗게 멍들어 가슴을 훑고

언젠가 다시 올 그날 그때를 위하여 (그대를 위하여)
아름다울 우리의 봄 여름 가을 겨울

La la la la la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la la la la 

이듬해 질 녘 꽃 피는 봄 한여름 밤의 꿈
가을 타 겨울 내린 눈 봄 여름 가을 겨울

ABOUT KONSHENS 
Since exploding on the music scene in 2005, the Jamaican born Konshens has become one of the few true icons/superstars in Dancehall, Reggae, and Global music. Having worked with the likes of Chris Brown, Cardi B, Doja Cat, Major Lazer, Chainsmokers, Sean Paul, Rick Ross, Nipsey Hussle, Ty Dolla Sign, E40, Enrique Iglesias, Rvssian, Nicky Jam, Farruko, and many more, there is no genre and musical styles off limits to this proven global hit maker. His international smash hits ""Bruk Off"" and 2017's ""Turn Me On”, to name a few, have helped drive towards his goal of elevating Dancehall and Jamaican music to a truly global level and acceptance world wide.
