Formed in Sacramento, CA, in 1988, the multiplatinum GRAMMY¬Æ Award-winning Deftones are an influential alternative presence with over 10 million records sold worldwide. In 2020, Deftones continued their trailblazing arc as an alternative leader with their ninth full-length album, Ohms, and a thrilling full-album remix of White Pony.

Lyrics:
Floating underwater
Ever changing picture
Hours out from land
In tune with all our dreams

The ocean takes me in
To watch you shake it
Watch you wave your powers
Tempt with hours of pleasure

Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight(We ride)

Cruising through the city
After hours with me
Fusing all our powers
Here's to all our dreams

Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight(We ride)

DEFTONES üêé - CHERRY WAVES ‚ô™ LIVE IN PARIS @ L'OLYMPIA 2017.05.02 by Nowayfarer üé∏ FULL ·¥¥·¥∞

In a sea of waves
We hug the same plank
Just as I had rehearsed it over in my brain
(I saw your end)

If the waves suck you in, and you drown

If like you should sink down beneath
I'll swim down
Would you? 
Would you?

You hang anchors over my neck
I liked it at first
But the more you you laughed, the crazier I came

And the waves suck you in, and you drown

If like you should sink down beneath
I'll swim way swim down. Would you?

Is that what you want?
You
Well that's what you've got

Wave, after, wave

If like you should sink down beneath, I'll swim down
Would you?

Is that what you want?
With you
Is this what you want?
With you, you

Escape, below

Lyrics:
I ain‚Äôt that coolA little fucked in the head
They‚Äôll be hanging me quick
When I‚Äôm back from the dead
Get the rope
¬†
I‚Äôm a punk rock kidI came from hell with a curse
She tried to pray it awaySo I fucked her in church
Don‚Äôt you know
¬†
They say you‚Äôre not safe here if I stay
With a knife that sharp no way
¬†
No I leave them broken heartedOh no look at the mess we startedOh no I leave the broken hearts this way
What you sayYou want to play
¬†
Yeah don‚Äôt be fooledI‚Äôm only letting you down
They pursued me on foot
But I hid in the crowd
Like a ghost
¬†
The seats of my carAre filled with cigarette burns
I got a fire in my eyeA little blood on my shirt
Let‚Äôs hit the road
¬†
I know there‚Äôs a special place in hell
That my friends and I know well
There‚Äôs a perfect place to goWhen it‚Äôs time to lose control
¬†
Nightmare daydream
You can‚Äôt save me

Lyrics
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day


And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that


Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be heroes, forever and ever
What d'you say?

I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim


Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes, just for one day


I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)


And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes


We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, just for one day

About David Bowie:
David Bowie redefined musical genres and the potential of live performance for generations of music lovers. Creating and discarding a variety of personae and restlessly challenging musical boundaries, Bowie released timeless albums including Space Oddity, Hunky Dory, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust‚Ä¶, Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs, Young Americans, Station to Station, ""Heroes,‚Äù Let's Dance, Heathen, The Next Day and many more. Blackstar, Bowie‚Äôs 28th and final studio album, was released on his 69th birthday, January 8, 2016. David Bowie died on January 10, 2016, two days after the release of Blackstar. His body of work, his influence on the worlds of music, art, fashion, film, theatre and beyond, and his legacy of innovation and reinvention will live forever. 2022 kicks off with Bowie at 75, a celebration of his 75th birthday with the Brilliant Adventure box set, the previously unreleased Toy, the 50th anniversary of Ziggy Stardust and a series of special events.

The pop legend who died on January 10, 2016, would have turned 74 today. That's why we honour him on our home page with his most famous Toppop recording made back in March 1974. 

David Robert Jones OAL (8 January 1947 ‚Äì 10 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie, was an English singer-songwriter and actor. A leading figure in the music industry, Bowie is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. He was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft had a significant impact on popular music.

During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum, eleven gold and eight silver album certifications, and released 11 number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Rolling Stone named him among the greatest artists in history and ‚Äì after his death ‚Äì the ""greatest rock star ever"".

This is the famous video of David Bowie recorded in the TopPop studios in Hilversum the Netherlands, under the direction of Rien van Wijk.
It was broadcast on 4 March 1974. Davis selected this video himself for the DVD 'Best of Bowie' (2004) as he really liked this recording. It was a big hit in the UK (#5)  and the Netherlands (#8).
On the same day David did a press conference in the Amstel Hotel in Amsterdam where he received an Edison award for 'Hunky Dory'

Lyrics:
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills 
and put your helmet on

Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, 
engines on
Check ignition 
and may God's love be with you

Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff

This is Ground Control 
to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule 
if you dare

This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating 
in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past 
one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much 
she knows

Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead,
there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you....

Here am I floating 
round my tin can
Far above the Moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

About David Bowie:
David Bowie redefined musical genres and the potential of live performance for generations of music lovers.

Blackstar, Bowie‚Äôs 28th and final studio album, was released on his 69th birthday, January 8, 2016. David Bowie died on January 10, 2016, two days after the release of Blackstar. His body of work, his influence on the worlds of music, art, fashion, film, theatre and beyond, and his legacy of innovation and reinvention will live forever. 2022 kicks off with Bowie at 75, a celebration of his 75th birthday with the Brilliant Adventure box set, the previously unreleased Toy, the 50th anniversary of Ziggy Stardust and a series of special events.

Lyrics:
It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling no
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

Lyrics

Ah, ah, ah, ah

(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance)
To the song they're playing on the radio
(Let's sway)
While colour lights up your face
(Let's sway)
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms
And tremble like a flower

(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
For fear your grace should fall
(Let's dance)
For fear tonight is all
(Let's sway)
You could look into my eyes
(Let's sway)
Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms
And tremble like a flower


(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance)
To the song we're playing
(Let's sway)
(Let's sway)
Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

(Let's dance)
(Let's)
(Let's)
(Let's)
(Let's dance)
(Let's)

Let's dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
(Let's dance)
(Let's sway)
(Let's sway)
Let's dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)

Lyrics

I know when to go out
And when to stay in
Get things done
I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try
I try
There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try
I try

Never going to fall for
(Modern Love)
Walks beside me
(Modern Love)
Walks on by
(Modern Love)
Gets me to the Church on Time
(Church on Time)
Terrifies me
(Church on Time)
Makes me party
(Church on Time)
Puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man)
No confessions!
(God and Man)
No religion
(God and Man)
Don't believe
In Modern Love

It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye

But I try
I try

Never going to fall for
(Modern Love)
Walks beside me
(Modern Love)
Walks on by
(Modern Love)
Gets me to the Church on Time
(Church on Time)
Terrifies me
(Church on Time)
Makes me party
(Church on Time)
Puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man)
No confessions!
(God and Man)
No religion
(God and Man)
Don't believe
In Modern Love

Modern love - Modern love - Modern love - Modern love
Modern love - Modern love - Modern love - Modern love

Lyrics:

Oh, yeah
Mmm
Still don't know what I was waitin' for
And my time was runnin' wild
A million dead end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
There's gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

Mmm, yeah

I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence
And so the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're goin' through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

Strange fascinations fascinate me
Ah, changes are taking
The pace I'm goin' through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Ooh, look out, you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah, what up, this is Dr. Dre
The party's goin' on
Thank God it's Friday

[Refrain]
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)

[Hook]
Keep their heads ringin'!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringin'!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)

[Verse 1]
Hey you! Sittin over there
Say what?
(You better get up out of your chair)
That's right
(And work your body down)
Yeah
(No time to funk around, cause we gon')
Funk you right on up
So get up: get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck, so call me ""Blacula""
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains, so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keeping it real enables me to make another mil'
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple: so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes' panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
1, 2 for the crew, 3, 4 for the dough
5 for the hoes (hoes!) 6, 7, 8 for Death Row
Mad niggas about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect - plus a check
Now I fin' to get into my mental
Will take care of this business I need to attend to cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you god damn right: I'm gonna kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
'Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

[Hook]

[Bridge]
If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down

[Verse 3]
Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear
Without a care, running shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sending all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the backdrop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop 'n Go
Dre came to wax you, so just call me Mop 'n Glow
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6'1"", 225, I'm pure chocolate
Your chances of jacking me are slim, G
'Cause I rock from summer until Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow
'Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro
So, check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

[Hook]

[Bridge]
If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down
If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down

[Outro]
I know you're bobbin' your head
'Cause I can see you
I know you're bobbin' your head
'Cause I can see you
You can't see me!
Death Row, let me know you in the house (Beyotch!)
Yeah, that's right, we out

#ItAintMe

Some folks are born made to wave the flag
Ooh, they're red, white and blue
And when the band plays ""Hail to the chief""
Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Lord, don't they help themselves, oh
But when the taxman comes to the door
Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale, yes
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no millionaire's son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks inherit star spangled eyes
Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord
And when you ask them, ""How much should we give?""
Ooh, they only answer ""More! More! More!"" yoh

It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no military son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, one

It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no no no
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate son, no no no

Since their formation in the 1960s, CCR has sold over 50 million records, while their songs remain in heavy rotation on the radio. 

Though the band only released 7 studio albums in their too-short career,  Creedence had an astonishing track record: eight consecutive gold singles (""Proud Mary,"" ""Bad Moon Rising,"" ""Green River,"" ""Down on the Corner,"" ""Who'll Stop the Rain,"" ""Up Around the Bend,"" ""Lookin' Out My Back Door,"" ""Have You Ever Seen the Rain?"") and eight consecutive gold albums. With music that sounds as fresh and compelling today as it did 30 years ago, CCR is one of a handful of bands whose entire body of work has attained true ""classic"" status.

Lyrics:

See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side.
I wait for you.
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait‚Äì without you

With or without you
With or without you.

Through the storm, we reach the shore
You gave it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you‚Äì

With or without you
With or without you.
I can't live with or without you.

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away.

My hands are tied, my body bruised
She got me with nothing to win
And nothing else to lose.

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away.

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you.

#U2 #IStillHaventFoundWhatImLookingFor #Remastered

Lyrics:

I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you.

I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her finger tips
It burned like fire
(I was) burning inside her.

I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one.
But yes, I'm still running.

You broke the bonds
And you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Oh my shame, you know I believe it.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

But I still haven't found

#U2 #One #Remastered

Lyrics: 

Is it getting better, or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now you got someone to blame?
You say one love, one life, when it's one need in the night.
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you baby if you don't care for it.

Did I disappoint you or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love and you want me to go without.
Well, it's too late tonight to drag the past out into the light.
We're one, but we're not the same.
We get to carry each other, carry each other... one

Have you come here for forgiveness,
Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much, more than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got.
We're one, but we're not the same.
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again.

You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law.
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got, when all you got is hurt.

One love, one blood, one life, you got to do what you should.
One life with each other: sisters, brothers.
One life, but we're not the same.
We get to carry each other, carry each other.

Lyrics: 

The heart is a bloom, shoots up through stony ground
But there's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck and the reason that you had to care,
The traffic is stuck and you're not moving anywhere.
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

It's a beautiful day, the sky falls
And you feel like it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if it doesn't ring true
You've been all over and it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

Touch me, take me to that other place
Teach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out
It was a beautiful day
A beautiful day
Don't let it get away

Touch me, take me to that other place
Reach me, I know Im not a hopeless case

What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
You don't need it now, you don't need it now
Beautiful day

Lyrics:

I wanna run, I want to hide
I wanna tear down the walls
That hold me inside.
I wanna reach out
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name.

I wanna feel sunlight on my face.
I see the dust-cloud
Disappear without a trace.
I wanna take shelter
From the poison rain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name.

We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love.
And when I go there
I go there with you
(It's all I can do).

The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust.
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled in dust.
I'll show you a place
High on a desert plain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name.

We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love.
And when I go there

#U2 #Pride #Remastered #InTheNameOfLove

Lyrics:

One man come in the name of love
One man come and go.
One man come he to justify
One man to overthrow.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One man washed up on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

Early morning, April four
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky.
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.",True,True,199004519.0,rock music

#U2 #SweetestThing #Remastered

Lyrics:

My love, she throws me like a rubber ball
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
But she won't catch me or break my fall.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a raincloud
You know she wants a dry kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)

I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?

I wanted to run, but she made me crawl
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
I know I got black eyes
But they burn so brightly for her
I guess it's a blind kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)

I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
Ain't love the sweetest thing?

Blue-eyed boy meets a brown-eyed girl.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
You can sew it up, but you still see the tear.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a rain-cloud,
Ours is a stormy kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)",True,True,106597387.0,pop rock

#U2 #Vertigo 

Lyrics:

Unos dos tres catorce!

Lights go down, it's dark
The jungle is your head
Can't rule your heart
A feeling is so much stronger than
A thought
Your eyes are wide
And though your soul
It can't be bought
Your mind can wander

Hello hello
I'm at a place called Vertigo
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something I can feel, feel

The night is full of holes
As bullets rip the sky
Of ink with gold
They twinkle as the
Boys play rock and roll
They know they can't dance
At least they know.

I can't stand the beats
I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails
Has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music
Swinging to the music
Oh oh oh oh

Hello hello
I'm at a place called Vertigo
It's everything I wish I didn't know
But you give me something I can feel, feel

Check mated
Oh yeah
Hours of fun

All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours

All of this, all of this can be yours
Just give me what I want and no-one gets hurt.

Hello hello
We're at a place called Vertigo
Lights go down and all I know
Is that you give me something

I can feel your love teaching me how
Your love is teaching me how, how to kneel

Yeah yeah yeah yeah",True,True,108148330.0,alternative rock

LYRICS
One man comes in the name of love
One man to come and go.
One man comes he to justify
One man to overthrow.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One boy washed up on an empty beach
One boy never will be kissed

In the name of love
One more in the name of love.
In the name of love
One more in the name of love.

In the evening, April four
A shot rings out in the Memphis sky.
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

In the name of love

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
A party we will throw
A party we will throw now

[Verse 1: The Game]
All I need is the chronic to keep me fit
A bad bitch, a project apartment and 2 pits
Red chucks, a red bic to keep my kush lit
Thank god for what I get but never really needed shit
I'm a hustler nigga, that's how I got this red Bentley
Slay the competition and told them that Dre sent me
Walk through the smoke like what up loc
Cause one always got that bomb dot com that make me choke
We gonna twist up 8 for Nate blow the smoke through the clouds
In hopes that it reaches the pearly gates
Now, how many niggas wanna throw up a dub
And be surrounded by the baddest bitches up in the club yeah
It's the math blood, sixes on the ave cuz
Phantom got your girl pussy wetter than my bath tub
Fuck her all night, wake her up at 6
Lil mama grab your shit, get ghost

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
A party we will throw
A party we will throw now

[Verse 2: Warren G]
Click clack what up, zig zag run up
Nic nac paddie whack, twisting up a fat sack
Tic tac toe up, I be in them streets like an intersection
I got connection, from every section
Critical, political, it's killer Cal'
Roll it up, now pass that shit around
My mental is cynical, original
Thinking you could see us
I'm like nigga how?
I'm in that diamond lane, I'm in that diamond chain
Glissing and glowing, I'm sipping liquor I'm blowing zippers my nigga I'm on one
I'm pushing the zone up, I'm sitting up, my pistol shining my chrome up
My nigga Game got the gun load
One shot mix a nigga brain like some gumbo, uh, oh
All that tough talk nigga, what for?
Shut your scary ass up at the front door

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
A party we will throw
A party we will throw now

[Warren G]
Couldn't nobody diss my nigga, damn I miss my nigga
Pour out a little liquor, big Nate Dogg nigga 213
From the city by the sea, where them G's ride
Turn around baby let me listen to the b-side
Slap that, tap that, after that, east side
As I travel this road I see the street sign
Ready for whatever, Beretta's you know I keep mine

[The Game]
It's the L-B, C-P-T nigga we be, OG to BG, that's where the weed be
Killer (what?) Cali-forni-a, eh
Load the strap, hop into the six trey Snoop, what up loc
I'm headed to the east side, G ride throwing up everything but the peace sign
Gold Daytonas, gangbang persona nigga trip, I'ma pop the top off his Corolla

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road

Lyrics:

[Intro]
I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...

[Verse 1]
I got love - I, got, love, for, my homies who be rollin wit me
Play no game - play, no, games, cause, ain't nobody playin with me
I got love - I, got, love, for my niggas on my family tree
I got love - love for the ghetto, down for whatever
If you was down before, then you still gon' be down with me
I got game - I, got, game, cause, the game was given to me
Say my name - say, my, name, cause, ain't nobody tighter than me
Give it up - give, it, up, if, you like the way I'm rocking this beat
I don't know - know nuttin better, chasin my chedder
If you in love with a whore -- you ain't never listened to me

[Break]
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh

[Verse 2]
Captain save - cap-tain, save, a, hooker cause she hangin on me
She can't hang - she, can't, hang, cause I ain't lookin fo' a wifey
Just in case - just, in, case, I, better take a weapon wit me
And these hoes - hoes keep cover, down for whatever
If she stress me some more, I have to leave her dead in the street
Run me how? Run, me, how? Cause, haters they be all in the mix
And they know - where, they, go-in, ain't gon' get no better than this
Can't they see? Can't, they, see, we, ain't some niggas they wanna diss?
D.P.G. - though I'll love a trick never, treat a bitch never
I told you before, so you better not be fuckin with me

[Break]
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

[Verse 3]
Platinum chains - plat-inum, chains, is, all you ever see on my neck
Diamond ring - dia-mond, rings, as, long as I can keep her in check
All the same - all, the, same, as, long as you don't ever forget
I was taught in the ghetto, wear the tight bellow
If she head for the stash, I always got this pistol with me
Constantly we bustin' to a hell of a beat
Then we came - then, we, came, cause, the bass'll knock you off of your feet
Just that deep - just, that, deep, I, betcha we be movin ya feet
Voice kinda mellow, place from the ghetto
If you still want some more, go and get the fuckin CD

[Outro]
I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...

Lyrics:

[Intro]
I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...

[Verse 1]
I got love - I, got, love, for, my homies who be rollin wit me
Play no game - play, no, games, cause, ain't nobody playin with me
I got love - I, got, love, for my niggas on my family tree
I got love - love for the ghetto, down for whatever
If you was down before, then you still gon' be down with me
I got game - I, got, game, cause, the game was given to me
Say my name - say, my, name, cause, ain't nobody tighter than me
Give it up - give, it, up, if, you like the way I'm rocking this beat
I don't know - know nuttin better, chasin my chedder
If you in love with a whore -- you ain't never listened to me

[Break]
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh

[Verse 2]
Captain save - cap-tain, save, a, hooker cause she hangin on me
She can't hang - she, can't, hang, cause I ain't lookin fo' a wifey
Just in case - just, in, case, I, better take a weapon wit me
And these hoes - hoes keep cover, down for whatever
If she stress me some more, I have to leave her dead in the street
Run me how? Run, me, how? Cause, haters they be all in the mix
And they know - where, they, go-in, ain't gon' get no better than this
Can't they see? Can't, they, see, we, ain't some niggas they wanna diss?
D.P.G. - though I'll love a trick never, treat a bitch never
I told you before, so you better not be fuckin with me

[Break]
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

[Verse 3]
Platinum chains - plat-inum, chains, is, all you ever see on my neck
Diamond ring - dia-mond, rings, as, long as I can keep her in check
All the same - all, the, same, as, long as you don't ever forget
I was taught in the ghetto, wear the tight bellow
If she head for the stash, I always got this pistol with me
Constantly we bustin' to a hell of a beat
Then we came - then, we, came, cause, the bass'll knock you off of your feet
Just that deep - just, that, deep, I, betcha we be movin ya feet
Voice kinda mellow, place from the ghetto
If you still want some more, go and get the fuckin CD

[Outro]
I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...

Lyrics:


Cada vez que me levanto
Y veo que a mi lado est√°s
Me siento renovado
Y me siento aniquilado
Aniquilado si no est√°s
T√∫ controlas toda mi verdad
Y todo lo que est√° de m√°s

Tus ojos me llevan lentamente al sol
Y tu boca me habla del amor y el coraz√≥n
Tu piel tiene el color
De un rojo atardecer

Y es por ti
Que late mi coraz√≥n
Y es por ti
Que brillan mis ojos hoy
Y es por ti
Que he vuelto a hablar de amor
Y es por ti
Que calma mi dolor

Y cada vez que yo te busco
Y no te puedo a√∫n hallar
Me siento un vagabundo
Perdido por el mundo
Desordenado si no est√°s
C√≥mo mueves t√∫ mi felicidad
Y todo lo que est√° de m√°s

Tus ojos me llevan lentamente al sol
Y tu boca me habla del amor y el coraz√≥n
Tu piel tiene el color
De un rojo atardecer

Y es por ti
Que late mi coraz√≥n
Y es por ti
Que he vuelto a hablar de amor
Y es por ti
Que brillan mis ojos hoy
Y es por ti
Que calma mi dolor

Cada vez que me levanto
Y veo que a mi lado est√°s
Me siento renovado

Tus ojos me llevan lentamente al sol
Y tu boca me habla del amor y el coraz√≥n
Tu piel tiene el color
De un rojo atardecer

Y es por ti
Que late mi coraz√≥n
Y es por ti
Que he vuelto a hablar de amor
Y es por ti
Que brillan mis ojos hoy
Y es por ti
Que calma mi dolor

Y es por ti
Y es por ti
Y es por ti
Y es por ti

LETRA

Uno por pobre y feo, hombre
Pero antoja'o, ay ome

Tengo la camisa negra
Hoy mi amor est√° de luto
Hoy tengo en el alma una pena
Y es por culpa de tu embrujo

Hoy s√© que t√∫ ya no me quieres
Y eso es lo que m√°s me hiere
Que tengo la camisa negra
Y una pena que me duele

Mal parece que solo me qued√©
Y fue pura todita tu mentira
Qu√© maldita mala suerte la m√≠a
Que aquel d√≠a te encontr√©

Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor
Yo qued√© moribundo y lleno de dolor
Respir√© de ese humo amargo de tu adi√≥s
Y desde que t√∫ te fuiste, yo solo tengo

Tengo la camisa negra
Porque negra tengo el alma
Yo por ti perd√≠ la calma
Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama

Cama, cama, come on, baby
Te digo con disimulo
Que tengo la camisa negra
Y debajo tengo el difunto

Pa' enterr√°rtelo cuando quieras, mamita

As√≠ como lo oyes, mi'ja

Tengo la camisa negra
Ya tu amor no me interesa
Lo que ayer me supo a gloria
Hoy me sabe a pura

Mi√©rcoles por la tarde y t√∫ que no llegas
Ni siquiera muestras se√±as
Y yo con la camisa negra
Y tus maletas en la puerta

Mal parece que solo me qued√©
Y fue pura todita tu mentira
Qu√© maldita mala suerte la m√≠a
Que aquel d√≠a te encontr√©

Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor
Yo qued√© moribundo y lleno de dolor
Respir√© de ese humo amargo de tu adi√≥s
Y desde que t√∫ te fuiste, yo solo tengo

Tengo la camisa negra
Porque negra tengo el alma
Yo por ti perd√≠ la calma
Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama

Cama, cama, come on, baby
Te digo con disimulo
Que tengo la camisa negra
Y debajo tengo el difunto

Tengo la camisa negra
Porque negra tengo el alma
Yo por ti perd√≠ la calma
Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama

Cama, cama, come on, baby
Te digo con disimulo
Que tengo la camisa negra
Y debajo tengo el difunto

Lyrics:

Que mis ojos se despierten
Con la luz de tu mirada yo
A Dios le pido
Que mi madre no se muera
Y que mi padre me recuerde
A Dios le pido

Que te quedes a mi lado
Y que mas nunca te me vayas mi vida
A Dios le pido
Que mi alma no descanse cuando
De amarte se trate mi cielo
A Dios le pido

Por los d√≠as que me quedan
Y las noches que a√∫n no llegan yo
A Dios le pido
Por los hijos de mis hijos
Y los hijos de tus hijos
A Dios le pido

Que mi pueblo no derrame tanta sangre
Y se levante mi gente
A Dios le pido
Que mi alma no descanse cuando
De amarte se trate mi cielo
A Dios le pido

Un segundo m√°s de vida para darte
Y mi coraz√≥n entero entregarte
Un segundo m√°s de vida para darte
Y a tu lado para siempre yo quedarme
Un segundo m√°s de vida yo

A Dios le pido

Y que si me muero sea de amor
Y si me enamoro sea de vos
Y que de tu voz sea este coraz√≥n
Todos los d√≠as a Dios le pido

Y que si me muero sea de amor
Y si me enamoro sea de vos
Y que de tu voz sea este coraz√≥n
Todos los d√≠as a Dios le pido

A Dios le pido

Que mis ojos se despierten
Con la luz de tu mirada yo
A Dios le pido
Que mi madre no se muera
Y que mi padre me recuerde
A Dios le pido

Que te quedes a mi lado
Y que mas nunca te me vayas mi vida
A Dios le pido
Que mi alma no descanse cuando
De amarte se trate mi cielo
A Dios le pido

Un segundo m√°s de vida para darte
Y mi coraz√≥n entero entregarte
Un segundo m√°s de vida para darte
Y a tu lado para siempre yo quedarme

Lyrics:


Cada vez que yo me voy
Llevo a un lado de mi piel
Tus fotograf√≠as para verlas cada vez
Que tu ausencia me devora entero el coraz√≥n
Y yo no tengo remedio m√°s que amarte

Y en la distancia te puedo ver
Cuando tus fotos me siento a ver
Y en las estrellas tus ojos ver
Cuando tus fotos me siento a ver

Cada vez que te busco te vas
Y cada vez que te llamo, no est√°s
Es por eso que debo decir
Que t√∫ solo en mis fotos est√°s

Cada vez que te busco, te vas
Y cada vez que te llamo, no est√°s
Es por eso que debo decir
Que t√∫ solo en mis fotos est√°s

Cuando hay un abismo desnudo
Que se opone entre los dos
Yo me valgo del recuerdo taciturno de tu voz
Y de nuevo siento enfermo este coraz√≥n
Que no le queda remedio m√°s que amarte

Y en la distancia te puedo ver
Cuando tus fotos me siento a ver
Y en las estrellas tus ojos ver
Cuando tus fotos me siento a ver

Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Te puedo ver, yeah

Cada vez que te busco, te vas
Y cada vez que te llamo, no est√°s
Es por eso que debo decir
Que t√∫ solo en mis fotos est√°s

LETRA

Dar√≠a lo que fuera por volverte a ver
Dar√≠a hasta mi vida y mi fusil, mis botas y mi fe
Por eso en la trinchera de mi soledad
Tus ojos son mi luz y tu esplendor mi coraz√≥n

Y si no fuera por ti yo no podr√≠a vivir
En el vaci√≥ de estos d√≠as de no saber
Y si no fuera por ti yo no seria feliz
Como lo soy cuando con tus besos me veo partir

Y es que solo con saber que al regresar tu esperaras por mi
Aumentan los latidos de mi coraz√≥n

Volverte a ver es todo lo que quiero hacer
Volverte a ver para poderme reponer
Porque sin ti mi vida yo no soy feliz
Porque sin ti mi vida no tiene ra√≠z
Ni una raz√≥n para vivir

Lo √∫nico que quiero es poder regresar
Poder todas las balas esquivar y sobrevivir
Tu amor es mi esperanza y tu mi munici√≥n
Por eso regresar a ti es mi √∫nica mission

Y si no fuera por ti yo no podr√≠a vivir
En el vaci√≥ de estos d√≠as de no saber
Y si no fuera por ti yo no seria feliz
Como lo soy cuando con tus besos me veo partir

Y es que solo con saber que al regresar tu esperaras por mi
Aumentan los latidos de mi coraz√≥n

Volverte a ver es todo lo que quiero hacer
Volverte a ver para poderme reponer
Porque sin ti mi vida yo no soy feliz
Porque sin ti mi vida no tiene ra√≠z
Ni una raz√≥n para vivir

Eres todo lo que tengo
Y no me quiero morir
Sin poder otra vez

Volverte a ver

Porque sin ti mi vida yo no soy feliz
Porque sin ti mi vida no tiene ra√≠z

Volverte a ver es todo lo que quiero hacer
Volverte a ver para poderme reponer
Porque sin ti mi vida yo no soy feliz
Porque sin ti mi vida no tiene ra√≠z
Ni una raz√≥n para vivir

LETRA

Para tu amor lo tengo todo
Desde mi sangre hasta la esencia de mi ser
Y para tu amor que es mi tesoro
Tengo mi vida toda entera a tus pies
Y tengo tambi√©n
Un coraz√≥n que se muere por dar amor
Y que no conoce el fin
Un coraz√≥n que late por vos

Para tu amor no hay despedidas
Para tu amor yo solo tengo eternidad
Y para tu amor que me ilumina
Tengo una luna, un arco iris y un clavel
Y tengo tambi√©n
Un coraz√≥n que se muere por dar amor
Y que no conoce el fin
Un coraz√≥n que late por vos

Por eso yo te quiero tanto que no s√© como explicar
Lo que siento
Yo te quiero porque tu dolor es mi dolor
Y no hay dudas
Yo te quiero con el alma y con el coraz√≥n
Te venero
Hoy y siempre gracias yo te doy a ti mi amor
Por existir

Para tu amor lo tengo todo
Lo tengo todo y lo que no tengo tambi√©n
Lo conseguir√©
Para tu amor que es mi tesoro
Tengo mi vida toda entera a tus pies
Y tengo tambi√©n
Un coraz√≥n que se muere por dar amor
Y que no conoce el fin
Un coraz√≥n que late por vos

Por eso yo te quiero tanto que no s√© como explicar
Lo que siento
Yo te quiero porque tu dolor es mi dolor
Y no hay dudas
Yo te quiero con el alma y con el coraz√≥n
Te venero
Hoy y siempre gracias yo te doy a ti mi amor

Letra / Lyrics: 

Hay mentiras en los labios
hay mentiras en la piel
qu√© dolor

Hay mentiras hay amantes
que por instantes de placer
ponen su vida a temblar

Hay mentiras compasivas
hay mentiras por piedad
que no quieren lastimar
hay mentiras que nos hieren
de verdad ay ay ay

Y hay enga√±os que por a√±os
ocultaron  la verdad
haciendo mucho da√±o

Ay yo me voy a refugiar
a la tierra de tu amor
mi verdad

T√∫ eres mi amor mi alegr√≠a
la verdad de mi vida
mi beb√© que me salta
a los brazos de prisa
t√∫ eres mi refugio y mi verdad
uoh yea
T√∫ eres mi amor mi alegr√≠a
la verdad de mi vida
mi beb√© que me calma
el alma con risas
t√∫ eres mi refugio y mi verdad

Hay mentira en la mirada
hay mentiras en la piel
dibujadas

Hay mentiras hay amantes
que por instantes de placer
ponen su vida a temblar
Hay doctrinas y oradores
dictadores sin piedad
que gobiernan sin verdad
y hay mentiras en los diarios
en las redes y en el bar
ay ay ay

Hay enga√±os que por a√±os
ocultaron la verdad
hiriendo de dolor

Ay yo me voy a refugiar
al oasis de tu amor

T√∫ eres mi amor mi alegr√≠a
la verdad de mi vida
mi beb√© que me salta
a los brazos de prisa
t√∫ eres mi refugio y mi verdad oh yeah
t√∫ eres mi amor mi alegr√≠a
la verdad de mi vida
mi beb√© que me calma
el alma con risas
t√∫ eres mi refugio y mi verdad

En un mundo tan irreal
no s√© en que creer
seeeeoooooo
y amor s√© que t√∫ eres mi verdad
eres mi verdad

T√∫ eres la luz de mi vida
t√∫ eres la voz que me calma
t√∫ eres la lluvia de mi alma
y eres toda mi verdad
T√∫ eres la luz de mi vida
t√∫ eres la voz que me calma
t√∫ eres la lluvia de mi alma

Their lineup consisted of brothers Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb. The trio were successful for most of their decades of recording music, but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as prominent performers of the disco music era in the mid-to-late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies; Robin's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the mid-to-late 1970s and 1980s. The Bee Gees wrote all of their own hits, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists.

Born on the Isle of Man to English parents, the Gibb brothers lived in Chorlton, Manchester, England, until the late 1950s. There, in 1955, they formed the Rattlesnakes. The family then moved to Redcliffe, in Queensland, Australia, and then to Cribb Island. After achieving their first chart success in Australia as the Bee Gees with ""Spicks and Specks"" (their 12th single), they returned to the UK in January 1967, when producer Robert Stigwood began promoting them to a worldwide audience.

The Bee Gees have sold more than 220 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997; the presenter of the award to ""Britain's first family of harmony"" was Brian Wilson, historical leader of The Beach Boys, another ""family act"" featuring three harmonising brothers. The Bee Gees' Hall of Fame citation says, ""Only Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks and Paul McCartney have outsold the Bee Gees.""

Following Maurice's death in January 2003, at the age of 53, Barry and Robin retired the group's name after 45 years of activity. In 2009, Robin announced that he and Barry had agreed the Bee Gees would re-form and perform again. Robin died in May 2012, aged 62, after a prolonged struggle with cancer and other health problems, leaving Barry as the only surviving member of the group's final line-up.",False,False,120135869.0,psychedelic pop

Written by Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb the song  is supposedly about someone who has done or said something horribly wrong, which results in feelings of social alienation. Others have described it as quite spiritual and could in fact be dealing with the Christian savior himself. Robin Gibb talked in 2009 about ""I Started a Joke"": ""This is a very spiritual song. The listeners have to interpret it themselves, trying to explain it would detract from the song"" The hauntingly beautiful melody brings the ballad up to one of the top 2 or 3 songs that the Bee Gees have ever written.",False,False,102310593.0,rock music

Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You better cool it off before you burn it out
You got so much to do and only
So many hours in a day (Ay)

But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want
Or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through (Oooh)
When will you realize... Vienna waits for you?

Lyrics:
She can kill with a smile
She can wound with her eyes
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
She hides like a child
But she's always a woman to me

She can lead you to love
She can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth
But she'll never believe
And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free
Yeah, she steals like a thief
But she's always a woman to me

They showed you a statue and told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
But they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done...
Only the good die young

You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
But that never hurt no one
Come on Virginia show me a sign
Send up a signal I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun
Darling, only the good die young

Lyrics:
Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said, Sonny, move out to the country
Workin' too hard can give you
A heart attack (ack)
You oughta know by now (oughta know)
Who needs a house out in Hackensack
Is that what you get with your money
It seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama if that's movin' up
Then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out
Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mister Cacciatore's down
On Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
He's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillac
You oughta know by now
And if he can't drive
With a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders
It seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama if that's movin' up
Then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out
You should never argue with a crazy mind (mmm)
You oughta know by now
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money
If that's what you have in mind
If that's what you're all about
Good luck movin' up
'Cause I'm moving out
I'm moving out
I'm moving out

Lyrics:
I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cuttin classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since thirteen, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the tre` duce
And the duce duce in my bubblegoose
Now i got the mack in my knapsack
Loungin' black, smoking sacks up in acts
And sidekicks with my sidekicks rockin fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is ""Where the party at?""
And can i bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
But i throw my vest on my chest
'Cause niggaz is a mess
It don't take nothin' but frontin'
For me to start somethin'
Buggin' and barkin' at niggaz like i was duck huntin'
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
Cause all we wanna do is...

Chorus:
Party... And bullshit, and... (x9)

Hugs from the honeys, Pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sei that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my peice
Sure do, two .22's in my shoes
Holler if you need me love i'm in the house
Roam and strollin' see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, hoe hopping, ain't no stopping Big Poppa, I'm a BAD BOY
Niggaz wanna front, who got your back? (BIGGIE!)
Niggaz wanna flex, who got the gat? (BIGGIE!)
It ain't hard to tell I'm the east coast overdoser
Nigga you scared you're supposed to
Nigga I toast ya, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and stuff
Or some brand-nubian shit beatin' down punks!

Chorus

Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, i think i might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, How to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaician rum
Conversations, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jacques got the glock in his waist and
we're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad than this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said ""Let's leave calm""
I'm hittin' skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggaz start to loke out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out

[Music stops, indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing,
Biggie breaks it up yelling ""Yo chill, man, chill!""]

Can't we just all get along?
So i can put hickies on her chest like Li'l Shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of Don Perrignon
And it's on, and I'm gone
that's that.

[Chorus w/ Puff talking after selected lines]

Party... and Bullshit, (Party.)
and Party... and Bullshit, (Bullshit.)
and Party... and Bullshit, (Party.)
and Party... and Bullshit, (Bullshit.)
and Party... and Bullshit, (Yea... Junior Mafia likes that.)

The Notorious B.I.G. channel is the official YouTube home of The Notorious B.I.G. featuring his catalog of official music videos. The Notorious B.I.G. is widely recognized as one of the world‚Äôs most influential rappers and has sold more than 17 million albums in the U.S. alone. Before his murder in 1997, Christopher Wallace recorded two classic albums as The Notorious B.I.G. His debut Ready to Die arrived in 1994 and helped revitalize the East Coast rap scene with massive hits like ‚ÄúBig Poppa‚Äù and ‚ÄúJuicy.‚Äù Life After Death was released in March 1997 just weeks after he was shot and killed in Los Angeles. The record topped the U.S. album charts and featured the hits ‚ÄúHypnotize‚Äù and ‚ÄúMo Money Mo Problems.‚Äù It remains one of the few hip-hop albums to ever achieve Diamond certification from the RIAA.",True,True,113010757.0,gangsta rap

Amiga m√≠a, lo s√©, s√≥lo vives por √©l
Que lo sabe tambi√©n, pero √©l no te ve
Como yo, suplicarle a mi boca que diga
Que me ha confesado entre copas
Que es con tu piel con quien sue√±a de noche
Y que enloqueces con cada bot√≥n que
Te desabrochas pensando en sus manos
√âl no te ha visto temblar, esperando
Una palabra, alg√∫n gesto un abrazo
√âl no te ve como yo suspirando
Con los ojitos abiertos de par en par
Escucharme nombrarle
!Ay, amiga m√≠a! Lo s√© y √©l tambi√©n

Amiga m√≠a, no s√© qu√© decir
Ni qu√© hacer para verte feliz
Ojal√° pudiera mandar en el alma o en la libertad
Que es lo que a √©l le hace falta
Llenarte los bolsillos de guerras ganadas
De sue√±os e ilusiones renovadas
Yo quiero regalarte una poes√≠a
T√∫ piensas que estoy dando las noticias

Amiga m√≠a, ojala alg√∫n d√≠a escuchando mi canci√≥n
De pronto, entiendas que lo que nunca quise fue contar tu historia
Porque pudiera resultar conmovedora
Pero, perdona, amiga m√≠a
No es inteligencia ni sabidur√≠a
Esta es mi manera de decir las cosas
No es que sea mi trabajo, es que es mi idioma

Y amiga m√≠a, princesa de un cuento infinito
Amiga m√≠a, tan s√≥lo pretendo que cuentes conmigo
Amiga m√≠a, a ver si uno de estos d√≠as
Por fin aprendo
A hablar sin tener que dar tantos rodeos
Que toda esta historia me importa
Porque eres mi amiga, oh no

Amiga m√≠a, lo s√©, s√≥lo vives por √©l
Que lo sabe tambi√©n, pero √©l no te ve
Como yo, suplicarle a mi boca que diga
Que me ha confesado entre copas
Que es con tu piel con quien sue√±a de noche

Amiga m√≠a, no s√© qu√© decir
Ni qu√© hacer para verte feliz
Ojal√° pudiera mandar en el alma o en la libertad
Que es lo que a √©l le hace falta
Llenarte los bolsillos de guerras ganadas
De sue√±os e ilusiones renovadas
Yo quiero regalarte una poes√≠a
T√∫ piensas que estoy dando las noticias

Amiga m√≠a, princesa de un cuento infinito
Amiga m√≠a, tan s√≥lo pretendo que cuentes conmigo
Amiga m√≠a, a ver si uno de estos d√≠as
Por fin aprendo
A hablar sin tener que dar tantos rodeos
Que toda esta historia me importa
Porque eres mi amiga
Amiga m√≠a, princesa de un cuento infinito
Amiga m√≠a, tan s√≥lo pretendo que cuentes conmigo

Escucha hermano la canci√≥n de la alegr√≠a
El canto alegre del que espera un nuevo d√≠a

Ven canta, sue√±a cantando
Vive so√±ando el nuevo sol
En que los hombres volver√°n a ser hermanos

Ven canta, sue√±a cantando
Vive so√±ando el nuevo sol
En que los hombres volver√°n a ser hermanos

Si en tu camino solo existe la tristeza
Y el llanto amargo de la soledad completa

Ven canta, sue√±a cantando
Vive so√±ando el nuevo sol
En que los hombres volver√°n a ser hermanos

Si es que no encuentras la alegr√≠a en esta tierra
B√∫scala hermano m√°s all√° de las estrellas

Ven canta, sue√±a cantando
Vive so√±ando el nuevo sol
En que los hombres volver√°n a ser hermanos

Si es que no encuentras la alegr√≠a en esta tierra
B√∫scala hermano m√°s all√° de las estrellas

Lyrics: 
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Lyrics:
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up, I don't know what to do

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done, I'm hanging up on you

I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me, 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day, but it'll be too late

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Every little thing, every little thing
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, waiting for your call
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly, so...
I don't know what to do

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Every little thing, every little thing
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, waiting for your call
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Lyrics:
Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're OK
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light, that's right
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let them be
Some boys try, and some boys lie
But I don't let them play, no way
Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world

Boys may come, and boys may go
And that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich, and now they're after me

'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

A material, a material, a material, a material world

Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world

Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world

Lyrics:
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken

Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

If I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

If I could melt your heart

Lyrics:
¬øC√≥mo puede ser verdad?
[English translation: ""How could it be true?""]

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
[""The beautiful island""]

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
[""He told you, 'I love you.'""]
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Te dijo te amo
El dijo que te ama
[""He said he loves you""]

La isla bonita
Your Spanish lullaby

Lyrics:
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there
Your voice can take me there
Like a prayer

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer

Fikki fikki, ow, ow, c'mon
Ah. yeah, ha, breakdown, c'mon

Hey, uh, c'mon, Madonna

C'mon, boy
I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll
Well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll, mmm
I want somebody to speed it up for me
Then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?

If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word, and I'mma give you what you want

The time is waiting
(We only got four minutes to save the world)
No hesitating
Grab a boy (Then grab a girl)
Time is waiting
(We only got four minutes to save the world)
No hesitating
(We only got four minutes, heh, a-four minutes)

So keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri (Hey) ma donna, uh
You gotta get 'em on, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
That's right, keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri (Hey) ma donna, uh
You gotta get 'em on, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)

Sometimes I think what I need is a ""you"" intervention, yeah
And you know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good, by the way that you move, oh hey
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, yeah
But if I die tonight, at least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how 'bout you?

[Madonna and Justin Timberlake:]

Lyrics:
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat, incomplete, I'd been had
I was sad and blue, but you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you, 'cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold
Oh, your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out what was scared and cold

Like a virgin (hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'til the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel I've nothing to hide

Like a virgin (hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Like a virgin
Like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me, and your heart beats, and you love me

Ooh, baby yeah
Can't you hear my heart beat for the very first time?

Lyrics:
Papa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now, I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy, please be strong
I may be young at heart, but I know what I'm saying

The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe
Please

Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind
I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm

He says that he's going to marry me
We can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice

But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now is some good advice
Please

Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind
I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, aah, ooh

Daddy, daddy, if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love
So please

Daddy, daddy
Daddy, daddy

Daddy, daddy, if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love
So please

Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach

Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach

Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind
I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby

Don't you stop loving me, daddy
I know I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh

Chorus:
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah

Lyrics: 

[Verse 1]
She was walking in the street, looked up and noticed
He was‚ÄÖnameless,‚ÄÖhe was homeless
She‚ÄÖasked him his name and told‚ÄÖhim what hers was
He gave her a story 'bout life
With a glint in his eye and a corner of a smile
One conversation, a simple moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah

[Verse 2]
She's riding in a taxi back to the kitchen
Talking to the driver 'bout his wife and his children
On the run from a country where they put you in prison
For being a woman and speaking your mind
She looked in his eyes in the mirror and he smiled
One conversation, a single moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough

[Bridge]
Everybody rise up
You gonna rise up, ayy

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come (Say you're gonna make it)
Young teachers, student doctors (Yeah)
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah

Lyrics:
[Intro: Whistling]

[Verse 1]
A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately

[Chorus 1]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see

[Verse 2]
Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea

[Chorus 2]
And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny

[Verse 3]
Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree

[Chorus 3]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's just meant to be

[Interlude: Whistling]

[Verse 4]
And when the pastor asks the pews
For reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seat

[Chorus 1]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see

[Outro: Whistling]
