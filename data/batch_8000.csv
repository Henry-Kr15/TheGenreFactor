A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance

Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making

LYRICS

Model house life meltdown
Still a modern dream let down
It kills me you know I‚Äôm dying out here
What would you trade the pain for?
I‚Äôm not sure

We were a hammer to the Statue of David
We were a painting you could never frame and
You were the sunshine
Of my lifetime
What would you trade the pain for?

This city always hangs a little bit lonely on me
Loose
Like a kid playing pretend in his father‚Äôs suit
I‚Äôd never go, I just want to be invited 
Oh
Got to give up
Get the feeling
Get the feeling
Don‚Äôt fight it
Fight it

Sending my love from the other side of the apocalypse 
And I just about snapped
Don‚Äôt look back
Every lover‚Äôs got a little dagger in their hand
Love from the other side of the apocalypse
And I just about snapped
Don‚Äôt look back
Every lover‚Äôs got a little dagger in their hand

Generation sleep I‚Äôm falling in and out of love
I‚Äôm getting that tilted feeling out here
What would you trade the pain for?
I‚Äôm not sure

Nowhere left for us to go but heaven
Summer falling through our fingers again and
You were the sunshine
Of my lifetime
What would you trade the pain for?

They say we gotta get ahead yeah,
No matter what it takes
But there‚Äôs no way off the hamster wheel on this rat race
I‚Äôd never go, I just want to be invited 
Oh
Got to give up
Get the feeling
Get the feeling
Don‚Äôt fight it
Fight it

Sending my love from the other side of the apocalypse 
And I just about snapped
Don‚Äôt look back
Every lover‚Äôs got a little dagger in their hand
Love from the other side of the apocalypse
And I just about snapped
Don‚Äôt look back
Every lover‚Äôs got a little dagger in their hand

I saw you in a bright clear field
Hurricane heat in my head
The kind of pain you feel to get good in the end
Good in the end
Inscribed like stone and faded by the rain:
‚ÄúGive up what you love
Give up what you love before it does you in‚Ä¶‚Äù

Sending my love from the other side of the apocalypse 
And I just about snapped
Don‚Äôt look back
Every lover‚Äôs got a little dagger in their hand
Love from the other side of the apocalypse
And I just about snapped
Don‚Äôt look back
Every lover‚Äôs got a little dagger in their hand

Love Tonight is a song of connectedness and togetherness, uniting the world in solidarity during a time of isolation, and now an anthem as we begin to come together again - in euphoric love during a time of release. The song creates a moment on the dance-floor, uniting us as we shake the isolation out of our limbs. A chant, a refrain, a hymn of connectedness and of the ecstatic: the love of moving and singing together as one. Shouse are delighted that David Guetta feels, and is spreading the Love Tonight!

Becky Hill, David Guetta - Remember (Lyrics)

I‚Äôm doing just fine now its over¬†
I‚Äôve been moving on and living my life¬†
But occasionally I lose composure¬†
And I can‚Äôt get you out of my mind
¬†
If I could go¬†
Back in time
I‚Äôd do things differently yeah I wouldn‚Äôt think twice
I distract myself
Think of someone else
But every now & then you remind me
¬†
It‚Äôs only when I‚Äôm lying in bed on my own
And I wake up and I don‚Äôt see your name on my phone
It‚Äôs in the moments where I think that I‚Äôm better alone
That‚Äôs when I remember¬†
That‚Äôs when I remember
¬†
Every time I walk past your house in the rain
And I tell myself that you were the biggest mistake
And just when I think I‚Äôm finally doing ok
That‚Äôs when I remember¬†
That‚Äôs when I remember¬†
¬†
My friends tell me I shouldn‚Äôt listen
To the voices that go round in my head
So I try to delete all the memories¬†
But you‚Äôre really hard to forget
¬†
I‚Äôm missing you
I‚Äôm missing you

(LYRICS)
Verse
Hello, it‚Äôs me your ex
I called to say not sorry but I wish you the best 
And I don‚Äôt hold no grudges, promise this ain‚Äôt a test, We ok, we ok
 
Pre
Sometimes it works out but sometimes it don‚Äôt
Maybe we‚Äôll fix this or maybe we won‚Äôt 
Sometimes a heart can sink like a stone 
Until you find home 
 
Chorus
This ain‚Äôt a heartbreak anthem, I don‚Äôt care what happened but I ain‚Äôt got no time to dwell on it 
Don‚Äôt want to throw a tantrum, you did what you had to, no i ain‚Äôt got no time to dwell on it 
And I don‚Äôt wanna feel, I don‚Äôt wanna feel hollow
Chasing you and me, chasing all of these shadows
This ain‚Äôt a heartbreak anthem, I don‚Äôt care what happened, but I ain‚Äôt got no time to dwell on it.
 
Verse 2
Hello, it‚Äôs me your ex (again)
I didn‚Äôt want to call but there‚Äôs this pain in my chest
And thanks to you I‚Äôm wearing out this bulletproof vest but I‚Äôll be ok, I‚Äôm ok
 
Pre
Sometimes it works out but sometimes it don‚Äôt
Maybe we‚Äôll fix this or maybe we won‚Äôt 
Sometimes a heart can sink like a stone 
Until you find home 
 
Chorus
This ain‚Äôt a heartbreak anthem, I don‚Äôt care what happened but I ain‚Äôt got no time to dwell on it 
Don‚Äôt want to throw a tantrum, you did what you had to, no i ain‚Äôt got no time to dwell on it 
And I don‚Äôt wanna feel, I don‚Äôt wanna feel hollow
Chasing you and me, chasing all of these shadows
This ain‚Äôt a heartbreak anthem, I don‚Äôt care what happened, but I ain‚Äôt got no time to dwell on it.

Dile que bailando te conoc√≠
Cu√©ntale
Dile que esta noche me quieres ver
Cu√©ntale
Cu√©ntale que beso mejor que √©l
Cu√©ntale
Dile que esta noche t√∫ me vas a ver
Cu√©ntale.
 
Cu√©ntale que te conoc√≠ bailando
Cu√©ntale que soy mejor que √©l
Cu√©ntale que te traigo loca
Cu√©ntale que no lo quieres ver
Cu√©ntale que te conoc√≠ bailando
Cu√©ntale que soy mejor que √©l
Cu√©ntale que te traigo loca
Cu√©ntale que no lo quieres ver.
 
Que quiz√°s fue la noche la que te traicion√≥
O el perfume de mi piel lo que te cautiv√≥
Que ya no tiene excusas pa' tu traici√≥n
Que tuviste mil motivos, que entre en raz√≥n
Que quiz√°s te habl√≥ al o√≠do como ya √©l no
O en mi arde el fuego de la pasi√≥n
Ya no le mientas m√°s y admite tu error
Y si es por m√≠, no pidas perd√≥n, digo
Queda de ti el que lo perdones
El que lo olvides o lo abandones
Porque con llorar no se compone
Entonces, a m√≠, dame otra noche.
 
Otra, otra noche, otra
Ay, que yo no te bot√©
Otra, otra noche, otra
Aunque t√∫ vuelvas con √©l
Otra, otra noche, otra

[Intro: Bad Bunny]
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh
Yeh

[Coro: Bad Bunny]
Hoy quiero que la noche salga
Pa' romperla, pa' romperla
Baby, p√≥nteme de espalda
Pa' romperla, pa' romperla
Hoy‚ÄÖquiero‚ÄÖque la noche‚ÄÖsalga
Pa' romperla, pa' romperla
Mamacita, p√≥ngase de‚ÄÖespalda
Pa' romperla, pa' romperla

[Verso 1: Don Omar]
D-D-D-Don (Ey)
Baby, vamo' a romper
S√© que saliste pa' joder
P√≥nteme linda pa' subir par de video' a mi cel
Y env√≠ame el location pa' pasarte a recoger
Si tocamo' la pista vo'a hacer que explote
Te vo'a meter el peine full, como pistola de bichote
Maquillada pa' que no se note
Que salimo' de noche y andamo' amanec√≠o' en el bote
Vamo' a beber, vamo' a fumar, una rola pa' pichar
Y un amigo pa' tu amiga que se la quiera tirar
A ti te gusta el ticket y contigo lo vo'a gastar
Fronteale a esto' loco' c√≥mo te tiene el pap√°, al d√≠a

[Puente: Don Omar]
P√°sala que est√° prend√≠a'
Ella siempre en la suya
Y yo siempre en la m√≠a
No lo pare', dale
De espalda ere' m√≠a
Te tengo prend√≠a'
T√∫ siempre de la tuya
Yo siempre de la m√≠a

[Coro: Don Omar]
Quiero que la noche salga
Pa' romperla, pa' romperla
Baby, p√≥ngase de espalda
Pa' romperla, pa' romperla
Hoy quiero que la noche salga
Pa' romperla, pa' romperla
Mamacita, p√≥ngase de espalda
Pa' romperla, pa' romperla

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny]
Ey, ey
Quiero que juegue' conmigo como si fuera un Play (Play)
Que suene el dembow y no me de' break
Que se junt√≥ El Rey con El Rey
Pa' que mueva el culo como en el 2006, ey (Ey, ey)
Y dale, no sea' t√≠mida, rompe abusadora
Que yo soy el m√°s duro de ahora
Si la dejan, janguea 24 hora' (Ey)
No est√° pa' casarse y mucho meno' ahora (Nah)
T√∫ est√°' dura y lo sabe' (Wuh)
T√∫ est√°' dura y lo sabe' (T√∫ lo sabe')
Un par de hater' que no la soportan (No)
Yo d√°ndole y el novio en la serie Jordan (Prr)
Si me tiran no se escondan, no (No se escondan)
Si me tiran no se escondan (Ah)
Despu√©' de esto se van a picar (Huh)
Pero tranquilo, que yo le mando un PayPal (Prr)
Las Louis Vuittone' clear y de cien la paca' (Ey)
Conmigo es que tu baby se pone bellaca (Ah)
La tengo temblando y no son las placa'
Aqu√≠ se usa si se saca (Prra)

[Coro: Bad Bunny]
Y yo quiero que la noche salga
Pa' romperla, pa' romperla
Baby, p√≥ngase de espalda
Pa' romperla, pa' romperla
Hoy quiero que la noche salga
Pa' romperla, pa' romperla
Mamacita, p√≥ngase de espalda
Pa' romperla, pa' romperla

Lyrics:

Love You Like a Brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover
You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that

Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire baby
Even when it's do or die
We can do it baby simple and plain

Lyrics:

Damn, cold world
I never thought I see that day that you're my old girl
Now I'm stuck here hollering at old girl
Got one, got two, three four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut one, hut two, told them niggas take a hike
Then it's on to the next one, on, on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

I wonder sometimes
I wonder if I was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone

Cause her eyes
And those hips
And that (ass)
Don't compare, at all (no)
And at best, all they do is distract me
But now, deep down, when I face it

All I want is you
All I want is you (now)
All I want is you now
Now that you're gone, gone, gone

Lyrics:
Hello, stranger
It's been a minute since we last kicked it
By the way, I just got in town
And I won't let cumulus clouds all in the sky ruin my vibe
Usually, I don't do this often
But since we're coolin', is it an option
Due to unusual rain and thunder
Baby, I wonder, baby, I wonder, would you just
Put your sweats on, put your sweats on for me
'Cause I got the plug, I made the call for green
I'm talking late-night for you
Let me lay a great time on you
Don't hesitate, no, don't you
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will

Lyrics:

Frustration, watching you dance
Have attention, to get in them pants
Come closer baby, so I can touch
One question, am I movin' too fast?

Cause I ain't leaving alone, feel like I could be honest, babe!
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna know
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah, you look good and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind I'm hoping you say two or three
You look good, we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time

Lyrics: 
Everyday I wake up(repeated)

can‚Äôt get enough
No I can‚Äôt get enough
Took another rap though I never ended up in cuffs
Had a gat in my hand but I didn‚Äôt want to be that man
Look in the mirror couldn‚Äôt see that man
Pick up the pen, never stick up the men, 
Only pick up the stick if I need to defend
If I did it back then might have dropped dead
Know a nigga doing life cause he‚Äôs a hot head

I‚Ä¶. 
Took a ride through my city the other day
Wonder what would've happened if it all went the other way
Jump in the whip now I reminisce 
On the days when I was running ‚Äòround the Ave
Could have never imagined the way that my life would've turned out
And all of the things that I have
I ain‚Äôt talking material, talking about my material
The shit that I‚Äôm writing, the shit that I‚Äôve been through
I went through the worst but I made it out
Like the Alpha Omega done showed me the way it could go
Yeah he laid it out 
Instead of sitting on the beach
I‚Äôm reconnecting with the streets 
He wasn‚Äôt paying attention
I was praying for ascension 
No need to need to mention my attention to detail
Homie we will prevail, lotta motherfuckers wanna wake up everyday 
Then they murder they own but they know there‚Äôs another way
Fuck all that violence and drugs in communities
This song right here is immunity
They call it the trap cause they trapping us 
Take our money then they don‚Äôt give it back to us
Black man can‚Äôt even get himself a bachelor
Dropped out of school then he picked up a spatula
Cause he never had a good role model just a hood role model 
Now I know that‚Äôs the old model 
We breaking that cycle
I think I see the finish line 
Got a vision now, don‚Äôt diminish mine
Lotta brothers in the hood doing good 
And I know I see see it all the time
But they only wanna push 
All the drugs, and all the crime, on channel 9
Fuck all that fallacy this shit right here for my people
People that struggle, people work hard as they can but don‚Äôt they still don‚Äôt feel equal
Trust me I know
I‚Äôve been there before
Trust me I know
That feeling won‚Äôt never go

Lucy Rose:
On a beautiful autumn day in 2011
Logic and his friends drive through the slums of College Park
In a Chevy Impala
Around the streets of Prince George‚Äôs County
Cruising through an unknown universe 
Beginning a journey that would inevitably alter the course
Of not only their own but the lives of millions of people around the world.

LYRICS

Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling

And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down,
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream ""are we having fun yet?""

Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no

It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
Cause living with me must have damn near killed you

And this is how, you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how, you remind me
Of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken

LYRICS

Well it's midnight, damn right, we're wound up too tight
I've got a fist full of whiskey, the bottle just bit me
Oh
That shit makes me bat shit crazy
We've got no fear, no doubt, all in balls out

We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Oh

We're screaming like demons, swinging from the ceiling
I got a fist full of fifties, tequila just hit me
Oh
We got no class, no taste, no shirt, and shit faced
We got it lined up, shot down, firing back straight crown

We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Oh

Ticking like a time bomb, drinking till the nights gone
Well get you hands off of this glass, last call my ass
Well no chain, no lock, and this train won't stop
We got no fear, no doubt, all in balls out

We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Oh
We're going off tonight

LYRICS
This time, This place
Misused, Mistakes
Too long, Too late
Who was I to make you wait
Just one chance
Just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know,
you know, you know

That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
and you'll never go
Stop breathing if
I don't see you anymore

On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all
I'd give for us
Give anything but I won't give up
'Cause you know,
you know, you know

So far away
Been far away for far too long
So far away
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know

I wanted
I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed
I need to hear you say
That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I forgive you
For being away for far too long
So keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and, never let me go
Keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and, never let me go

LYRICS

How the hell did we wind up like this?
Why weren't we able, to see the signs that we missed
And try turn the tables

I wish you'd unclench your fists, and unpack your suitcase
Lately there's been too much of this
But don't think it's too late

Nothing's wrong, just as long as
You know that someday I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right but not right now
I know you're wondering when

Well I'd hope that since we're here anyway
That we could end up saying
Things we've always needed to say
So we could end up staying
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror

Nothing's wrong, just as long as
You know that someday I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right but not right now

LYRICS

I'm through with standing in line
To clubs we'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth
And I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out
Quite the way I want it to be

(Tell me what you want)

I want a brand new house
On an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough
For ten plus me

(So what you need?)

I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet

(Been there, done that)

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me

(So how you gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair, and well

Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free

(I'll have the quesadilla, ha, ha)

I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me

(So how you gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair

And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial, well

Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a pez dispenser
I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

Well, we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair

And we'll hide out in the private rooms

How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, god, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since god knows when

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, god, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.

I miss that town
I miss the faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could I relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.

Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
Every time I do it makes me...",True,True,218072638.0,alternative rock

LYRICS

My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
Cause the hands of time are never on your side

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?

Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day",True,True,204404663.0,alternative rock

RM explained on the Weverse live stream that his friends are always asking how he can forget things so easily all the time so he began to wonder why he is so forgetful, that‚Äôs how the song came to life, fitting his personality really well. But for me, this song goes perfectly when you're being comforted in nature as Kim Sawol says in the comment at the end of the video.

üíú This video is from a small yet intimate concert at Rolling Hall on December 5, 2022. RM returned to his roots, in the heart of Hongdae, where the rapper made a name for himself in the underground hip-hop scene when he was a teenager. It was his long-time dream to perform at Rolling Hall and 200 lucky fans were able to attend the concert.

üíú Turn on CC if you want to read the subtitle, it's easy. Mouse over to the ‚ÄòCC‚Äô button in your video manager and click on it. That turns on the CC or you can switch it off. The general ‚ÄòOptions‚Äô section allows you to increase the font size, change the font or color, and move the subtitle around to place it where you like.

üíú My goal is to deliver English subtitles that are correctly translated, and easy to read and understand, whilst not being an element that disturbs or irritates you. 
But I cannot make the rappers rap slowly ;) 

üíú Regardless of the translation source for the subtitle, I also search for information about the meaning of the song and the lyrics. I fix errors, sync the subtitles to the video and replace words or sentences that need a better translation to make it easier to understand and/or follow the subtitles.

üíú I work on creating subtitles for BTS videos so that we can understand the songs better, as the lyrics are a big part of BTS music. I know a subtitle, as an option to turn on, will make people enjoy BTS more.

Lyrics:

You know the bed feels warmer
Sleeping here alone
You know I dream in colour
And do the things I want

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

Keep the snow and sleigh rides
Keep those silver bells
Keep the gifts beneath the tree

Keep the reindeer my heart already knows how to fly 

Cause all I‚Äôve ever wanted
Was nothing I got and 
Santa, can‚Äôt you hear me

Tell me what can I do, oh yeah

Keep the mistletoe (keep the mistletoe) 
Unless below is what I need, oh

Keep those bows and boxes
Keep those three wise men
No need for a North Star to show me where I will end

Cause all I‚Äôve ever wanted 
Isn‚Äôt on a shelf and 
Santa, can‚Äôt you hear me 

I don‚Äôt need a thing

Lyrics:

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did,
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

Lyrics:
Every time I look around this room my eyes they tend to fall on you
And I confess nothing but you makes sense
Memories fill my heart 
and I can barely keep my tears from falling
Oh I want your love
Do you ever think of us
 
Is it too late too late to open up 
I‚Äôm dying to say oh how I love you
You‚Äôre walking towards me now 
 
Push my pride aside
When I close my eyes 
It‚Äôs just you and I 
Here under the mistletoe
Magic fills the air
Standing over there
Santa hear my prayer
Here under the mistletoe
All I want hey yeah 
All I want hey hey yeah
All I want hey yeah 
Is under the mistletoe
 
Everything I try to keep you from getting inside 
Works until I see your face
I linger hoping you might stay
Wrapped up in your arms is where I wanna spend my nights so hard how much I want ya
Do you think of us 
How I want your love 
Is it too late too late to let you know
I can‚Äôt quite escape how much I need ya 
You‚Äôre walking towards me now 
 
Push my pride aside
When I close my eyes 
It‚Äôs just you and I 
Here under the mistletoe
Magic fills the air
Standing over there
Santa hear my prayer
Here under the mistletoe
All I want hey yeah 
All I want hey hey yeah
All I want hey yeah 
Is under the mistletoe
 
You‚Äôre walking towards me now
Won't you read my mind somehow
Meet me in the middle underneath a little bit of mistletoe
And indecision take a breath as I 

Push my pride aside 
When I close my eyes
It‚Äôs just you and I 
Here under the mistletoe
Magic fills the air
Standing over there
Santa hear my prayer
Here under the mistletoe
All I want hey yeah 
All I want hey hey yeah 
All I want hey yeah 
Is under the mistletoe  
All I want hey yeah 
All I want hey hey yeah 
All I want hey yeah 
Is under the mistletoe  
 
Push my pride aside aside aside
It‚Äôs just you and I 
All I want 
All I want 
Is you
Is you

Lyrics:

Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway

Rusi nu gucci koi gehna sohneya ehna ta karna paina sohneya
 
(Badshah)

Tell me whachu want tipi tipi tap
Savaa ki kalai saadhe teen ki neck
Geetan di machine badboy on the track
Baby kare bounce jaise hateron ke cheque
Sir pe hai crown baby no cap
Sick meri drip meri sick vocab
Bache bache ko rate mere rap baby
Mind hote blow jab beat kare slap
10 mein se 10 tu main 10 mein se 20
Tere siva aage ne kisi ke bolun please
Berkin lele lele gucci ki kameez
Tere peeche poora town mere peeche hai police
Baby you‚Äôre a good girl and im a bad boy
Mera lifestyle hai thoda flamboyant
I got it I  flaunt it
The only time I  give a fuck is when she wants it

(Devika Badyal)

Sohneya Prada Ni Paranda cahida-2
Fer meluga je dil laina sohneya - 2

(Karan Aujla)

Lagdi a shy honey   hi honey . 
Sun di a bad bunny u bad bunny üê∞ 
Mai khana kehndi lebanese dao money 
Te ledo kehndi tiffany u so funny 

Lagdi ae red chilli Tu red chilli üå∂Ô∏è 
Sohni Eye lash ( eilish ) teri Tu jive Billie .
Tere utto var dva mai few millis 
Te Tenu lage joke kra u so silly 

Menu kehndi sarda ni jattan nal aukha 
Menu kehndi chaah nyio peendi peeni mocha 
Kehndi menu hun ta Tu leja Mexico 
nak val dekh jatta palea mai koka 

Kde kehndi ah lelo te oh lelo 
Ghdiya v matchinga ji do lelo 
Lamboa v krnia ne show lelo 
Menu kehndi u black and me yellow

(Devika Badyal)

Rusi nu gucci koi gehna sohneya ehna ta karna paina sohneya
Sohneya Prada Ni Paranda cahida-2
Fer meluga je dil laina sohneya - 2

üìù Lyrics

Ho jo na paas tu to aati dhangh se saanse nahi ,
Chidhchida sa rehta hu main lagta hu kuch khaas nahi 
Jabse marne lage hai tujhpe , bachne ki koi aas nahi mere 

Zindagi main aayi jabse vibe hi badal gayi 
Ghumta tha main aawara , life si sambhal gayi 
Duniya meri dark si mein light si ek jal gayi , yeaah 
Teri baaton main dil kho sa gaya
Meri raaton main din ho sa gaya
Pyaar kehete jisko , finally wo ho sa gaya
Finally , finally , finally 
Raaha na pehle sa shy ab , samjh main kuch naa aaye ab 
Bolo na kya kia jaaye ab
Aankhon se neenden hai gaayab 
Khush main itna kyu hun ?
Tujhko tavajjo main kyu dun ?
Jaane kya hua mujhe , 
Tere pyaar main chamku jaise jugnu 

Baadal bhi dhikhte mujhko dil ke shape main
Happiness si rehne lagi meri jeb main
Haarne main hai maza yeh wo game hai 
Haalat jo hai teri meri bhi same hai
Teri baaton main dil kho sa gaya
Teri raaton main din ho sa gya
Pyaar kehete jisko , finally wo ho sa gaya
Finally , finally , finally 
Rahi na pehle si shy ab , samjh main kuch naa aaye ab
Bolo na kya kia jaaye ab
Aankhon se neenden hai gaayab 
Khush hu main itna kyu hun?
Tujhko tavajjo main kyu dun ?
Jaane kya hua mujhe , 
Tere pyaar main chamku jaise jugnu 

Tujhko ab door mujhse , ( Kuch na tujhse pehle tha )
kar na koi payega ( kuch na tere baad mein)
Sochna kya jaanejana (Yeh haath tere haath mein)
 Jo hoga dekha jayega ( Yeh duniya jaaye bhaadh mein)
Mujhko ab door mujhse , kar na koi payega 
Sochna kya jaanejana , jo hoga dekha jayega 

Raaha na pehle sa shy ab , samjh main kuch naa aaye ab 
Bolo na kya kia jaaye ab
Aankhon se neenden hai gaayab 
Khush main itna kyu hu?
Tujhko tavajjo main kyu dun ?
Jaane kya hua mujhe , 
Tere pyaar main chamku jaise jugnu

Dino James pens down the difficulties behind missing someone that he has loved. He feels helpless and apologetic. Ikka feels his heart sinking as he is incapable of fixing the broken relationship and cannot deal with the heartache anymore. Badshah‚Äôs verse starts by asserting that it is okay for a man to break down and go through the gut-wrenching feeling of a fleeting romance. ‚ÄòWoh‚Äô is an extremely personal track which is bound to shake you if you have ever loved someone.

Lyrics:
Proper patola
Nakhra ae swag
Suit Patiala shahi chunni teri black
O munde honke bharde
Tainu takk takk ke
Turre jadon hath tu
Lakk utte rakh ke

Proper patola
Nakhra ae swag
Suit Patiala shahi
Chunni meri black
O munde honke bharde
Mainu takk takk ke
Nachan jadon hath main
Lakk utte rakh ke


(Badshah Rap)
Look! Rabb ne husna di rakhi koi thod nahi
Gallan di laali nu makeup di koi lod nahi
Phull ne gulaab de
Bull ne janaab de
Sonh lagge mummy di mainu
Tera koi tod nahi
Thodi te til kaala kudiye ni baatan paave
Suit Patiala, Gucci Vucci nu maatan paave
Ghar tera ni main aape labh loon
Saanu bas das ja tu naa‚Äôm

Proper patola
Nakhra ae swag
Suit Patiala shahi chunni teri black
O munde honke bharde
Tainu takk takk ke
Turre jadon hath tu
Lakk utte rakh ke

Main laa dun tujhe haar
Pehna doon tujhe kangan
Ho taiyyar
Ghuma doon tujhe London
Haath mein rakhun haath rakhe jis cheez pe
Heere jadwa doon teri kaali kameez pe

Na nach mere naal aake tu close
Haan chal patli gali se tu nikal
Tere jaison ko rakhti hoon on-toes

Lyrics:
Kaanon Mein Ikk Dil Ki Baat Sunavaan Ni
Tenu Hansda Vekh Ke Jag Nu Main Bhul Jaavan Ni
Dassde Kiddan Gal Tenu Samjhawan Ni
Oh Ab Tu Shad De Ohnu Jo Ae Tere Naal

Nakhre Kyun Kardi Ae

Kinna Sawaal Kardi Ae
Enna Main Sunta Nahi

Hor Dass Kinniya Tareefan
Chahidi Ae Tenu (x4)

(Badshan Rap)
Baby Mera Mind, Tu Kare Blow
Baaki Kare Shine, Tu Kare Glow
Jeans Hai Daali
Daali Tune Jo Woh Teri Booty Pe Tight
Baby Jaise Mera Flow

Baby God Damn Tu Hai 100
Baaki Average, Tu Hai Savage
Baby Tu Hai Raw
Mujhe Teri Body Ki Har Woh Cheej Lage Sexy
Jo Baakiyon Ko Lagti Hai Flaw

Baby Let‚Äôs Go, Right Now
Dekho Mujhe Wait Na Itni Karaao
Lakk Tera Lean, Baatein Teri Mean
Dieting Pe Hai Toh Kyun Khati Bhaav

Hor Dass Kinniya Tareefan
Chahidi Ae Tenu (x4)

Kyun Samjhe Na Baatein Meri Tu
Kyun Ae Lad‚Äôdi
Soorat Ae Sohni, Seerat Teri Bewafa
Samjhe Na Ishaare

Lyrics:
Ek ho gaye hum aur tum
Humma humma humma‚Ä¶
Toh udd gayi ninde re
Hey humma‚Ä¶

Ek hogaye hum aur tum
Toh udd gayi ninde re
Aur khanki payal masti mein
Toh kangan‚Ä¶

Yeh pehli baar mile
Tumpe ye dum nikle
Tumpe ye jawaani dheere dheere
Maddham machle re

Humma humma‚Ä¶
Humma humma humma
Hey hamma hamma..
Humma humma humma

(Badshah)
Mujhe dar iss baat ka hai bas
Ke kahin na ye raat nikal jaaye
Mere itne bhi paas tu aa mat
Kahin mere haathon se na baat nikal jaaye

Bolunga sach main jo de tu ijazat
Sabar bhi ab karne laga bagawat
Zulfein hain zaalim aur aankhen hain aafat
Lagta hai hone wali hai qayamat

Mat tadpa aise tu
Na kar na-insaafi
Jo ghalti karne wala hoon main
Uske liye pehle se hi maangta hoon maafi

Aye‚Ä¶ aye‚Ä¶

Khili chandni jaisa ye badan
Janam mila tumko
Mann mein socha tha jaisa roop tera
Aaya nazar humko

Sitam khuli khuli
Ye sanam gori gori
Ye baahein karti hai yoon
Humein tumne jab gale lagaya
Toh kho hi gaye hum

Humma humma‚Ä¶
Humma humma humma
Hey hamma hamma‚Ä¶
Humma humma humma


Ek ho gaye hum aur tum
Humma humma humma
Toh udd gayi ninde re
Hey humma‚Ä¶

Jhoothi LIAR
Kala Kala Chashma Jo Jaata Hai Tere Mukhde Pe
Jaisa Kaala Til Jachta Hai Tere Chin Pe
Apni Adaon Se Zyaada Nahin Toh Dus Baara Ladke Toh Maar Hi Deti Hogi Tu Din Mein

Tujh Jaise Chattis Phirtey Hai
Meri Wargi Aur Na Honi Ve 
Tu Munda Bilkul Desi Hai
Main Katrina Toh Sohni Ve

Lyrics:
BADSHAH FT. AASTHA GILL

Usney mujhe
Chhua bhi nahi
Aisa waisa kuch
Hua bhi nahi
Nazar thi paini, hui bechaini
Aankhon aankhon mein shaitani ho gayi
Saiyaan ne dekha aise
Main paani paani ho gayi ( 3)

Rap verse 1
Chalegi kya
Glass pada hai khaali, bharegi kya
Saath aaye launde se daregi kya
Andar ki feeling se ladegi kya
Hadd ho gayi
Hadd se aagey bhi badhegi kya
Nau acre mein farm , farm pe ghodey
Ghodey pe chadhegi kya
123, gaadi ke bonnet se nikle pari
Laundey aagey kahin tikte nahi
Baatein hain kaidi meri, likh le kahin
Chal niklein kahin

Aisi hoon khoyi kabhi khoyi hi nahin
Aankhein mili hain jabsey soyi hi nahi
Duniya se, suney hain, kissey tere
Jaane kya aayega hisse mere
Issi khayaal mein deewani ho gayi
Saiyaan ne dekha aise
Main paani paani ho gayi (2)

Rap verse 2
Image kharaab, kaam galat hai
News mein naam aata har week
Phir bhi jahaan se guzroon
Har bandi ke mooh se nikle cheekh
Haath pakad par dil na laga
Jo kehti hai karke dikhe
Sunne mein aaya hai tu marti hai humpe
Marr ke dikha
Rehne de, mooh bandh rakh
Aankhein jo kehti hain kehne de
Bohot ruki hai aaj tu 
Paani banke khud ko behne de

It‚Äôs yo boy badshah

Nazar thi paini, hui bechaini
Aankhon aankhon mein shaitani ho gayi
Saiyaan ne dekha aise.

Lyrics : 
Ve ek look maahi tera
Jaan le jaaye mera
Sar pe chadh jaaye para
Hosh udd jaaye sara.    X 2

Feeling samjh le Dildara

Dil-e-Naadan haaye Tauba
Hua nuksaan haaye Tauba
In aankhon se tune dekha
Gayi meri jaan haaye Tauba

RAP 
Ye baatein choti choti hain
Inhein badi naa banao
Laal rang wali aankhon walon ko
Jhandi hari naa dikhao
Shaitan hain sire ke hum
Hume pari na dikhao
Ye aag aisi hai
Ise saawan ki jhadi na dikhao

Ghalat hai sab, Par lage hai sahi
Aakhein band kar, Daregi to nahi
Jo bhi mai bolunga, Karegi tu wahi
Jahan mujhe chuaa tune,
Wahan tu gayi

Antra 
Teri mai teri hu teri hu mai
Tu jaan le yaara
Ke dil me phool khile tere naam ke
Ye maan le yaara

Jo chahti hai tu humse
Wo hum kar nahi saktey
Ke jinme dil hi naa ho wo kisi pe
Mar nahi saktey

Feeling samjh le Dildara

Dil-e-Naadan haaye Tauba
Hua nuksaan haaye Tauba
In aankhon se tune dekha
Gayi meri jaan haaye Tauba. X 2

Lyrics

Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand
Oh my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Lyrics

When I'm with you baby
I go out of my head
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
All the things you do to me
And everything you said
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

We walk together
We're walking down the street
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Every time I think of you
I know we have to meet
And I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

It's getting hotter
It's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

And when it rains
You're shining down for me
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Just like a rainbow
You know you set me free
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

You're like an angel
And you give me your love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

Lyrics

Reach out and touch faith

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there

Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer

Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver

Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there

Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver

Reach out and touch faith

Your own personal Jesus

Reach out and touch faith

Lyrics

Precious and fragile things
Need special handling
My God what have we done to you
We always tried to share
The tenderest of care
Now look what we have put you through

Things get damaged
Things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give

Angels with silver wings
Shouldn't know suffering
I wish I could take the pain for you
If God has a master plan
That only He understands
I hope it's your eyes He's seeing through

Things get damaged
Things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give

I pray you learn to trust
Have faith in both of us
And keep room in your hearts for two

Things get damaged
Things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give

Lyrics

You had something to hide
Should have hidden it, shouldn't you
Now you're not satisfied
With what you're being put through
It's just time to pay the price
For not listening to advice
And deciding in your youth
On the policy of truth

Things could be so different now
It used to be so civilised
You will always wonder how
It could have been if you'd only lied
It's too late to change events
It's time to face the consequence
For delivering the proof
In the policy of truth

Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before

Now you're standing there tongue tied
You'd better learn your lesson well
Hide what you have to hide
And tell what you have to tell
You'll see your problems multiplied
If you continually decide
To faithfully pursue
The policy of truth

Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before

Lyrics

Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand
Oh my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Lyrics

There'll be times
When my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable
But when you think I've had enough
From your sea of love
I'll take more than another riverful
And I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Strangelove
Strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove
That's how my love goes
Strangelove
Will you give it to me
Will you take the pain
I will give to you
Again and again
And will you return it

There'll be days
When I stray
I may appear to be
Constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach
I'm not trying to say
I'll have it all my way
I'm always willing to learn
When you've got something to teach
And I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Pain will you return it
I'll say it again - pain
Pain will you return it
I won't say it again

I give in
Again and again
I give in
Will you give it to be
I give in
I'll say it again
I give in

I give in
Again and again
I give in
That's how my love goes
I give in
I'll say it again
I give in

Lyrics:

They‚Äôve been sayin, you‚Äôre sophisticated
They‚Äôre complaining - over-educated
You are saying all the words I‚Äôm dreaming
Say it after me
Say it after me

They will blame us, crucify, and shame us 
We can‚Äôt help it if we are a problem 
We are trying hard to get your attention
Climbing up your wall.
Climbing up your wall.

Don‚Äôt go there cause you‚Äôll never return
I know you think of me when you think of her 
But then it don‚Äôt make sense 
when you‚Äôre trying hard to do the right thing
But without recompense
 And then you did something wrong and they said it was great 
 And now you don‚Äôt know how you could ever complain
Because you‚Äôre all confused cause you want me to
 But then you want me to do it the same as you


You were waiting for the elevator
You were saying all the words I‚Äôm dreaming 
No more asking, questions or excuses
Information‚Äôs here, here and everywhere

Don‚Äôt go there cause you‚Äôll never return
I know you think of me when you think of her
But then it don‚Äôt make sense 
when your trying hard to do the right thing
But without recompense
 And then you did something wrong and they said it was great 
 And now you don‚Äôt know how you could ever complain
Because you‚Äôre all confused cause you want me to
 But then you want me to do‚Ä¶.it the same way as you
But I don‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt want anything 
I know it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs not your fault
I don‚Äôt want anyone
As I do in life for you

Stockholders

Same shit different life
I‚Äòll get it right some time
Maybe not tonight

I don't have love

I don't have fun
Without your love
Life is too short
But I will live for you
You're backin' off
But I will live for you, my selfless love
Bite my tongue, I wait my turn
I waited for a century
Waste my breath, no lessons learned

Lyrics:

Every breath you take and every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take, I'll be watching you
Every single day, every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay, I'll be watching you

Oh can't you see, you belong to me
How my poor heart aches with every step you take

Every move you make and every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake, I'll be watching you

Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around, but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby, please

Oh can't you see, you belong to me
How my poor heart aches with every step you take

Every move you make and every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake, I'll be watching you
Every move you make, every step you take, I'll be watching you

I'll be watching you
(Every breath you take, every move you make)
(Every bond you break, every step you take)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say)
(Every game you play, every night you stay)

Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to sell your body to the night
Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Walk the streets for money
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right

Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light

(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
Oh

I loved you since I knew ya
I wouldn't talk down to ya
I have to tell you just how I feel
I won't share you with another boy
I know my mind is made up
So put away your make up
Told you once I won't tell you again it's a bad way

Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light

(Roxanne) You don't have to put on the red light

Just a castaway, an island lost at sea, oh
Another lonely day with no one here but me, oh
More loneliness than any man could bear
Rescue me before I fall into despair, oh

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, yeah

A year has passed since I wrote my note
I should have known this right from the start
Only hope can keep me together
Love can mend your life but love can break your heart

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, yeah
Oh, message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle

Walked out this morning, don't believe what I saw
A hundred billion bottles washed up on the shore
Seems I'm not alone at being alone
A hundred billion castaways looking for a home

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, oh
Message in a bottle, yeah

- LYRICS -

Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
Ask her if she'll marry me
In some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing, every little thing
Every, every little thing
Every little, every little, every little
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
That she does is magic
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing, she does is magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ey oh, yo oh
Eee oh oh oh oh oh

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

- LYRICS -

Young teacher, the subject
Of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
Inside her there's longing
This girl's an open page
Book marking, she's so close now
This girl is half his age

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration
So bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting
His car is warm and dry

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Loose talk in the classroom
To hurt they try and try
Strong words in the staffroom
The accusations fly
It's no use, he sees her
He starts to shake and cough
Just like the old man in
That book by Nabokov

Don't stand so close to me
Please don't stand so close to me

Well, someone told me yesterday
That when you throw your love away
You act as if you just don't care
You look as if you're going somewhere
But I just can't convince myself
I couldn't live with no one else
And I can only play that part
And sit and nurse my broken heart

So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely

Now no-one's knocked upon my door
For a thousand years, or more
All made up and nowhere to go
Welcome to this one man show
Just take a seat, they're always free
No surprise, no mystery
In this theatre that I call my soul
I always play the starring role

So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely

I feel lonely, I'm so lonely, I feel so low

Giant steps are what you take
Walking on the moon
I hope my legs don't break
Walking on the moon
We could walk forever
Walking on the moon
We could live together
Walking on, walking on the moon

Walking back from your house
Walking on the moon
Walking back from your house
Walking on the moon
Feet they hardly touch the ground
Walking on the moon
My feet don't hardly make no sound
Walking on, walking on the moon

Some may say
I'm wishing my days away
No way
And if it's the price I pay
Some say
Tomorrow's another day
You stay
I may as well play

Giant steps are what you take
Walking on the moon
I hope my legs don't break
Walking on the moon
We could walk forever
Walking on the moon
We could be together
Walking on, walking on the moon

Some may say
I'm wishing my days away
No way
And if it's the price I pay
Some say
Tomorrow's another day
You stay
I may as well play

Keep it up, keep it up
Yo yo yo yo

Don't think me unkind
Words are hard to find
The only cheques I've left unsigned
From the banks of chaos in my mind
And when their eloquence escapes me
Their logic ties me up and rapes me

De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true

Poets, priests, and politicians
Have words to thank for their positions
Words that scream for your submission
And no one's jamming their transmission
Because when their eloquence escapes you
Their logic ties you up and rapes you

De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true

De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you

I've called you so many times today
And I guess it's all true what your girlfriends say
That you don't ever want to see me again
And your brother's gonna kill me and he's six feet ten
I guess you'd call it cowardice
But I'm not prepared to go on like this

I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't stand losing you
I can't stand losing you
I can't stand losing you
I can't stand losing you

I see you've sent my letters back
And my LP records and they're all scratched
I can't see the point in another day
When nobody listens to a word I say
You can call it lack of confidence
But to carry on living doesn't make no sense

I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing

I guess this is our last goodbye
And you don't care so I won't cry
But you'll be sorry when I'm dead
And all this guilt will be on your head
I guess you'd call it suicide
But I'm too full to swallow my pride

I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing

Lyrics

DROPPIN DOWN HOPPIN OUT STRAIGHT OUT THE CASKET
POP LOCK AND DROP YA LIKE HUEY DONE ASKED ME
MUD ON MY CORPSE IF YOU CRAZY IM BAT SHIT
BONES IS THE ONE THE GAME HATE WITH A PASSION
WHEN DID IT START I THINK I KNOW
THE SECOND I CHOSE TO COME OUT OF MY TOMB
EVERYONE GATHER HOLD HANDS AND LET OUT 
A BIG &quot;FUCK YOU BONES&quot; ON 2
1 2 COMIN THROUGH YOUR CREW LOOK LIKE TOO WONG FOO
GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOUR LOOT MOTHERFUCKER GIMME TRUTH
AND IF YOU ALL OUT OF THE LATTER IMA HAVE TO TAKE THE FIRST
TRY TO BOP ME FOR MY SPOT HOLD UP SOMEONE GET THIS BOY A HEARSE
IM TAKING THE LONG WAY HOME TONIGHT
I JUST NEED SOME SPACE I DONT WANNA LIVE TODAY
RAN INTO THE CROW OF THE AFTER LIFE
HE OPENED UP HIS BEAK WHISPERED BONES PLEASE COME WITH ME
DEADBOY WHAT BIG EYES YOU HAVE 
THE BETTER TO SEE YOU
WITH HANDS OF THE WITCH CURSED WITH ONE GRIP
I WILL RISE FROM THE FIRE FINNA BLOW AWAY WITH THE BREEZE

Letra:

S√©
Que hay en tus ojos con solo mirar,
Que est√°s cansado de andar y de andar
Y caminar
Girando siempre en un lugar

S√©
Que las ventanas se pueden abrir,
Cambiar el aire depende de ti‚Ä¶
Te ayudar√°, Vale la pena una vez m√°s.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda,
Quitarnos los miedo, dejarlos afuera‚Ä¶
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el coraz√≥n

Vale m√°s el presente que el futuro,
Dale suave que aqu√≠ no hay apuro
Ya salimos adelante, ya no le des mente
Y abrazo pa¬¥ toda mi gente.

√â melhor perder-se que nunca embarcar
Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
E assim ser√°
E a vida muda, mudar√°.

S√©
Que en lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza alg√∫n d√≠a se ir√° y as√≠ ser√°
La vida cambia y cambiar√°

Sentir√°s que el alma vuela
Por cantar una vez m√°s.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, echarlos pa fuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el coraz√≥n

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro
con el coraz√≥n

Lyrics:

Tengo en una libreta tantas canciones
Tiene tu nombre, y tengo razones
Para buscarte y volverte a hablar
 
Dice en esa libreta sin m√°s razones
La hora y la fecha y dos corazones
Y dice Calle San Sebasti√°n
 
Y si tengo que escoger
Me quedo, me quedo contigo
Y si yo vuelvo a San Juan
Yo bailo, yo bailo contigo
 
Y si te tengo que olvidar
T√∫ sabes que no va a pasar
Y si te vuelvo a ver
Me quedo, me quedo, me quedo, me quedo, me quedo contigo
 
Contigo desde Alaska a Buenos Aires
Contigo desde Londres hasta Nueva York
Maldito castigo le grito al aire
Si yo s√© que contigo siempre estoy mejor
 
Tengo en mi libreta esa canci√≥n boricua
Esa que escrib√≠ pensando en tu boquita
Y yo quiero bailarla bien apretaita
Carita con carita cosita rica
 
Tengo en mi libreta esa canci√≥n bonita
La que siempre, siempre, fue tu favorita
La que siempre, siempre, mueve tu boquita‚Ä¶
 
Y si tengo que escoger
Me quedo me quedo contigo
Y si yo vuelvo a San Juan
Yo bailo, yo bailo contigo
 
Y si te tengo que olvidar
T√∫ sabes que no va a pasar
Y si te vuelvo a ver
Me quedo, me quedo, me quedo, me quedo, me quedo contigo
 
Guardo en una libreta de direcciones
Tu nombre escrito y unas canciones
Y siento ganas de irte a buscar
 
Dice en esa libreta sin m√°s razones
La hora y la fecha y dos corazones
Y dice Calle San Sebasti√°n
 
Y si tengo que escoger
Me quedo, me quedo contigo
Y si yo vuelvo a San Juan
Yo bailo, yo bailo contigo
 
Y si te tengo que olvidar
T√∫ sabes que no va a pasar
Y si te vuelvo a ver
 
Me quedo, me quedo, me quedo, me quedo, me quedo contigo
 
Me quedo, me quedo, me quedo contigo
 
Tengo en mi libreta esa canci√°n boricua
Esa que escrib√≠ pensando en tu boquita
Y yo quiero bailarla bien apretaita
 
Me quedo, me quedo, me quedo contigo
 
Tengo en mi libreta esa canci√≥n bonita
La que siempre, siempre, fue tu favorita
La que siempre, siempre, mueve tu boquita
 
Me quedo, me quedo, me quedo contigo

Puedo no roncar por las ma√±ana
Puedo trabajar de sol a sol

RBD ‚Äì Siempre He Estado Aqu√≠ 

Desde febrero he vuelto a escribirte canciones 
Desde hace tanto quiero darte explicaciones 
Con un lo siento quiero devolver el tiempo 
Para volver y que en un beso me perdones 
Lo bonito de la vida es que no olvidas no 
Nunca olvidaras el primer amor
Pero, aunque se pase el tiempo 
Vuelve el viento que te hizo contener la respiraci√≥n 
Yo siempre he estado aqu√≠ 
Yo nunca te olvide 
Porque un amor tan grande 
No se va no se fue 
Yo siempre he estado aqu√≠ 
Yo nunca me aleje 
Porque mi coraz√≥n siempre estar√° donde tu est√©s
No tengo que volver 
Si yo nunca me fui 
Yo siempre he estado aqu√≠ 
Yo 
Ooh 
Ooh 
Yo siempre he estado aqu√≠ 
Yo 
Ooh 
Ooh 
S√°lvame con este coraz√≥n
Tan solo ens√©name un poco de tu amor 
Y solo qu√©date en silencio 
Que aun hay tanto por contar 
Y hay canciones que nos quedan por cantar 
Volver a sentir, lo que me enamora 
Lo que no se olvida  
Aunque pasen las horas
Yo siempre he estado aqu√≠ 
Yo nunca te olvide 
Porque un amor tan grande no se va no se fue 
Yo siempre he estado aqu√≠ 
Yo nunca me aleje 
Porque mi coraz√≥n siempre estar√° donde tu est√©s
No tengo que volver 
Si yo nunca me fui 
Yo siempre he estado aqu√≠ 
Yo 
Ooh 
Ooh 
Yo siempre he estado aqu√≠ 
Yo 
Ooh 
Ooh
