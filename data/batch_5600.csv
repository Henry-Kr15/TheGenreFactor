Walking out of the door I'm on my way can you 
tell me just where I'm going
Occupational skills would you give me a clue 
what to do cause my minds in motion
Just trying to relax I find myself on the couch with 
big plans but there's always tomorrow
Is something wrong with me or the way that I'm thinking

Come on Come on and tell me why you're staring
Come on Come on it must be what I'm wearing
Come on Come on and tell me why's it taking so long for you to recognize and stop

Another day in the sun I'm having fun feel the heat sneaking up on me
I take a look in the sky a plane goes by is that the reason that I can't breathe
I take a look and I wonder why, why these birds don't fly
It's hard for me to see and I believe my oh my

[Chorus]

I took a trip to the bar does my money go far can you show me just how to spend it
Moving around I like the sound I find myself looking pretty stupid
If I had a gal she'd be in a dress I better slow my drinking down
If I don't get it together tonight they're gonna run me out of town

Lyrics:
I'm so tired of being alone,
I'm so tired of on my own,
Won't you help me, girl,
Just as soon as you can.
People say that I've found a way,
To make you say,
That you love me.
But baby,
You didn't go for that,
Ha, it's a natural fact,
That I want to come back,
Show me where it's at, baby.
I'm so tired of being alone,
I'm so tired of on my own,
Won't you help me, girl,
Soon as you can.
I guess you know that I, uh,
I love you so,
Even though,
You don't want me no more,
Hey, hey, hey, hey I'm cryin' tears,
Through the years,
I tell you like it is,
Honey, love me if you can.
Ya baby,
Tired of being alone here by myself, now
I tell ya, I'm tired baby,
I'm tired of being all wrapped up late at night,
In my dreams, nobody but you, baby.
Sometimes I wonder,
If you love me like you say you do,
You see baby, I, I, I, I've been thinking about you,
I've been wanting to get next to you, baby,
Sometimes I hold my arms and I say,
Oh baby, yeah, needing you has proven to me,
To be my greatest dream, yeah
Awh!
I'm so tired of being alone,
I'm so tired of on my own,
Sometimes late at night I get to wonderin' about you baby,
Baby, baby, ya ya, baby you're my heart's desire

They're tryin' to tear us apart
They don't believe in this love of mine
But they don't know what love is

They don't know what love is

Lyrics:

Hit the message I can hear you calling 
No one's going anywhere tonight 
We conceived a modern generation 
It was free but now we pay the price 

We're the victims of our own creation 
Chasing rainbows that are painted black or white 
Watch the struggle of our own temptation 
Instincts barely keeping us alive 

Back to the rhythm that we all came from 
Voices of Babylon, streets of London 
Back to the people that we know so well 
A space in time removed too soon to tell",True,True,3858649.0,new wave

Lyrics: 

Travelling in a fried-out Kombi
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said:

Do you come from a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover.""",True,True,597510470.0,Not Found

Lyrics: 

Who can it be knockingat my door?
Go away, don't come 'round here no more
Can't you see that it's late at night?
I'm very tired and I'm not feeling right
All I wish is to be alone
Stay away, don't you invade my home
Best off if you hang outside
Don't come in, I'll only run and hide

Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?""",True,True,214168241.0,Not Found

Lyrics:
Moving up and down and from side to side
With so many things to do
I want to go again I want another ride
This time should see it through

We never realized as the years rolled by
No we never really had a clue
But we knew one day we'd come alive
And in the end there's me and you

My babe, she gives me everything
She gives me everything I need

When the winter comes and the cold sets in
As this city's prone to do
They forecast heavy seas and gale force winds
that's really nothing new

When I'm falling down
Deeper than the underground
My thoughts race back to you
Again and again

My babe, she gives me everything
she gives me everything I need

And if you think us fools
And you criticize
Then my friend the joke's on you

My babe, she gives me everything
She gives me everything I need.

Lyrics: 

Dr. Heckyll works late at the laboratory
Where things are not as they seem
Dr. Heckyll wishes nothing more desperately
Than to fulfill all of his dreams
Letting loose with a scream in the dead of night
As he's breaking new ground
Trying his best to unlock all the secrets
But he's not sure what he's found
Dr. Heckyll is his own little guinea pig
'Cos they all think he's mad
Sets his sights on the search of a lifetime
And he's never, never sad

Whoa oh, it's off to work he goes
In the name of science and all its wonders....

This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive
They are a person who feels good to be alive
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive
Believes the underdog will eventually survive",True,True,3465339.0,pop rock

""The Bomb! (These Sounds Fall into My Mind)"" is a house music track by The Bucketheads, released in 1995. ""The Bomb!"" was later dubbed into the project's sole album All in the Mind. It was a commercial hit in the UK in winter/spring 1995, reaching #5 in the singles chart.

The track was produced by Masters At Work member Kenny ""Dope"" Gonzalez, and features samples from Chicago's ""Street Player"". One sample was later used by Nicola Fasano VS. Pat Rich for ""75, Brazil Street"", which was later used by Pitbull with ""I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)"". The subtitle of the song is a mondegreen; the actual lyrics taken from the Chicago sample are ""Street sounds swirling through my mind..."".",True,True,,house music

Lyrics:
(Verse 1)
You know what?
Cause I'm gonna say
Craig David
7 days
Check it out...

On my way to see my friends
Who lived a couple blocks away from me (owh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her name
A six digit number & a date with me tomorrow at nine

Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl aged 24
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? let me update
What did she say? She said she'd love to
Rendezvous
She asked me what we were gonna do
Said we'd start with a bottle of Moët for two


(Chorus)
Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday & Friday & Saturday we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday & Friday & Saturday we chilled on Sunday

(Verse 2)
Nine was the time
Cuz I'll be getting mine
And she was looking fine
Smooth talker
She told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it (back she flipped it, ooh the
Way she
Kicked)
And I oh oh I yeah
Hope that she'd care
Cuz I'm a man who'll always be there

Ooh yeah
I'm not a man to play around baby
Ooh yeah
Cuz a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl hmm you don't seem to be like that
Cuz there's no need to chat for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing of my phone
When your feeling all alone
All you gotta do
Is just call me call me


(Chorus)
Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday & Friday & Saturday we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday & Friday & Saturday we chilled on Sunday

(Break it down, break it down)
Since I met this special lady
Ooh yeah
I can't get her off my mind
She's one of a kind
And I ain't about to deny it
It's a special kind of thing
With you-oh.......

Chorus

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday & Friday & Saturday we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday & Friday & Saturday we chilled on Sunday, Sunday Sunday Sunday....",True,True,259354180.0,pop music

Lyrics
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away oh to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away oh to find a better day
I'm walking away

Sometimes some people get me wrong
When it's something I've said or done
Sometimes you feel there is no fun
That's why you turn and run
But now I truly realise 
Some people don't wanna compromise
Well I saw them with my own eyes spreading those lies
And well I don't wanna live a lie, too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights, I'm sorry to say lady

I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away oh to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away oh to find a better day
I'm walking away

Well I'm so tired baby
Things you say you're driving me away
Whispers in the powder room baby 
Don't listen to the games they play
Girl I thought you'd realise 
I'm not like them other guys
Coz I saw them with my own eyes
You should've been more wise
And well I don't wanna live a lie, too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights, I'm sorry to say lady

I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away oh to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away oh to find a better day

Lyrics:

There’s something in your DNA, cos heaven did it right,
Baby when you were made, you hit it different,
I feel some type of way, I’ll never be, never be the same,
There’s something in your DNA NA, cos heaven did it right,
Baby when
you were made, you hit it different,
I feel some type of way, I’ll never be, never be the same,
There’s something in your DNA
Yeah,
When you close to me,
We can’t help but explore, you touch every part of me (yeah),
And when we kissed, you left me begging
for more (more),
I just want more
You’re in my bones, you’re in my veins,
It feel like home, when you’re holding me,
You’re in my soul, and I can’t explain,
You take me to another place
There’s something in your DNA, cos heaven did it right,
Baby when y
ou were made, you hit it different,
I feel some type of way, I’ll never be, never be the same,
There’s something in your DNA NA, cos heaven did it right,
Baby when you were made, you hit it different,
I feel some type of way, I’ll never be, never be the sa
me,
There’s something in your DNA
Yeah
When I saw you, it felt like we met before,
In another life, another time, I know that for sure,
Let’s not pretend this ain’t, what we been waiting for (for),
What we waited for
You’re in my bones, you’re in my
veins,
It feel like home, when you’re holding me,
You’re in my soul, and I can’t explain,
You take me to another place
There’s something in your DNA, cos heaven did it right,
Baby when you with me, you hit it different,
I feel some type of way, I’ll never
be, never be the same,
There’s something in your DNA NA, cos heaven did it right,
Baby when you with me, you hit it different,
I feel some type of way, I’ll never be, never be the same,
There’s something in your DNA

Lyrics
All right (can you feel me)
Come on
Can you fill me in

I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She phoned said, ""hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down start kissing, caressing
Told me about jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they ran a fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying why were you creeping around late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
When I returned, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in
 
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it cause you felt cold
I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying why can't you keep your promises no more
Say you'll be home by 12, come strolling in at 4
Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in
Wearing a jacket, who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in",True,True,34889112.0,pop music

Lyrics
Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over,
And it seems as though the writings on the wall,
Superstar you finally made it,
But once your picture becomes tainted,
It's what they call,
The rise and fall [x2]

I always said that I was gonna make it,
Now it's plain for everyone to see,
But this game I'm in don't take no prisoners,
Just casualties,
I know that everything is gonna change,
Even the friends I knew before may go,
But this dream is the life I've been searching for,
Started believing that I was the greatest,
My life was never gonna be the same,
Cause with the money came a different status,
That's when things change,
Now I'm too concerned with all the things I own,
Blinded by all the pretty girls I see,
I'm beginning to lose my integrity

Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over,
And it seems as though the writings on the wall,
Superstar you finally made it,
But once your picture becomes tainted,
It's what they call,
The rise and fall

I never used to be a troublemaker,
Now I don't even wanna please the fans,
No autographs,
No interviews,
No pictures,
Endless demands,
Give into vices that was clearly wrong,
The type that seems to make me feel so right,
But some things you may find can take over your life,
Burnt all my bridges now I've run out of places,
And there's nowhere left for me to turn,
Been caught in comprimising situations,
I should have learnt,
From all those times I didn't walk away,
When I knew that it was best to go,
Is it too late to show you the shape of my heart,

Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over,
And it seems as though the writings on the wall,
Superstar you finally made it,
But once your picture becomes tainted,
It's what they call,
The rise and fall

Now I know,
I made mistakes,
Think I don't care,
But you don't realise what this means to me,
So let me have,
Just one more chance,
I'm not the man I used to be,
Used to beeeeeeeeeee

Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over,
And it seems as though the writings on the wall,
Superstar you finally made it,
But once your picture becomes tainted,
It's what they call,
The rise and fall [x4]

Lyrics
(Jim Beanz, give it to me, oh baby I can't!)

Never thought that I'd fall in love, love, love, love
But it grew from a simple crush, crush, crush, crush
Being without you girl, I was all messed up, up, up, up
When you walked out, said that you'd had enough-nough-nough-nough

Been a fool, girl I know
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time, you'll change your mind
Now looking back i wish i could rewind

Because i can't sleep til you're next to me
No i can't live without you no more
Oh i stay up til you're next to me
Til this house feels like it did before
Feels like insomnia ah ah, Feels like insomnia ah ah
Feels like insomnia ah ah, Feels like insomnia ah ah

Remember telling my boys that I'd never fall in love, love, love, love
You used to think I'd never find a girl I could trust, trust, trust, trust
And then you walked into my life and it was all about us, us, us, us
But now I'm sitting here thinking I messed the whole thing up, up, up, up

Been a fool (fool), girl I know (know)
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time (time), you'll change your mind (mind)
Now looking back i wish i could rewind

Because i can't sleep til you're next to me
No i can't live without you no more (without you no more)
Oh i stay up til you're next to me (to me)
Til this house feels like it did before (Because it)
Feels like insomnia ah ah, Feels like insomnia ah ah
Feels like insomnia ah ah (Ah), Feels like insomnia ah ah

Ah, i just can't go to sleep
Cause it feels like I've fallen for you
It's getting way too deep
And i know that it's love because

I can't sleep til you're next to me
No i can't live without you no more (without you no more)
Oh i stay up til you're next to me (to me)
Til this house feels like it did before
Feels like insomnia ah ah, Feels like insomnia ah ah
Feels like insomnia ah ah, Feels like insomnia ah ah

Feels like insomnia ah ah, Feels like insomnia ah ah
Feels like insomnia ah ah, Feels like insomnia ah ah

Lyrics

For all the years that I've known you baby
I can't figure out the reason why lately you've been acting so cold
(didn't you say)
If there's a problem we should work it out
So why you giving me the cold shoulder now
Like you don't even wanna talk to me girl
(tell me)
Ok I know I was late again
I made you mad and dinners thrown in (the bin)
But why are you making this thing drag on so long
(I wanna know)
I'm sick and tired of this silly game
(silly games)
Don't think that I'm the only one here to blame
It's not me here who's been going round slamming doors
That's when you turned and said to me
I don't care babe who's right or wrong
I just don't love you no more.

Rain outside my window pouring down
What now, your gone, my fault, I'm sorry
Feeling like a fool cause I let you down
Now it's, too late, to turn it around
I'm sorry for the tears I made you cry
I guess this time it really is goodbye
You made it clear when you said
I just don't love you no more

I know that I made a few mistakes
But never thought that things would turn out this way
Cause I'm missing something now that your gone
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/craig-david/-/i-just-dont-luv-u-no-more.html]
(I see it all so clearly)
Me at the door with you in a state
(in a state)
Giving my reasons but as you look away
I can see a tear roll down your face
That's when you turned and said to me
I don't care babe who's right or wrong
I just don't love you no more.

Rain outside my window pouring down
What now, your gone, my fault, I'm sorry
Feeling like a fool cause I let you down
Now it's, too late, to turn it around
I'm sorry for the tears I made you cry
I guess this time it really is goodbye
You made it clear when you said
I just don't love you no more

Don't say those words it's so hard
They turn my whole world upside down
Girl you caught me completely off guard
On the night you said to me
I just don't love you more.

Rain outside my window pouring down
What now, your gone, my fault, I'm sorry
Feeling like a fool cause I let you down
Now it's, too late, to turn it around
I'm sorry for the tears I made you cry
I guess this time it really is goodbye
You made it clear when you said
I just don't love you no more

Rain outside my window pouring down
What now, your gone, my fault, I'm sorry
Feeling like a fool cause I let you down
Now it's, too late, to turn it around
I'm sorry for the tears I made you cry
I guess this time it really is goodbye
You made it clear when you said
I just don't love you no more

Dancing
To a different tempo
It could just be an echo
I’ve been reflecting my perspective
And now i know
That love is never simple
No matter high or low
And if it brings you pain then its ok for you to let go

We don’t need no drama don’t need problems in my head
We don’t need no drama dance with my body instead
When the night falls on us one by one we will forget
Every bit of that drama

Cos we don’t need no dramamamamamamama
Need that dramamamamamamama
Cos we don’t need no dramamamamamamama
Need that dramamamamamamama

Talking
In a different lingo
You told me your heart broke
You’ve been reflecting, counting blessings
And now you know
That love is never simple
No matter where it goes
And if it brings you pain then its ok for you to let go
The sun aint always shining
But trust me girl we’ll be fine yeah
Oh we’ve all been hurt before, yeah
Cos love is never simple
We gotta take things slow
And if it brings you pain then its ok for you to let go

We don’t need no drama don’t need problems in my head
We don’t need no drama dance with my body instead
When the night falls on us one by one we will forget
Every bit of that drama

Cos we don’t need no dramamamamamamama
Need that dramamamamamamama
Cos we don’t need no dramamamamamamama
Need that dramamamamamamama

We don’t need
The problems in my head
We don’t need
The things we gon’ forget
We don’t need
A dance with me instead
We don’t need

Cos we don’t need no dramamamamamamama

Lyrics 
Craig David: 
Is it really love, is it all in my mind
Is it crazy I think of you all of the time, baby 
Is it really love, can you give me a sign
Cause I’m losin’ my head tryna make you mine 
 
Is it really love, is it all in my mind
Is it crazy I think of you all of the time, baby 
Is it really love, can you give me a sign
Cause I’m losin’ my head tryna make you mine 
 
KSI:
Gotta lotta time for the one that I’m watchin’ 
Amazon Prime if you wanna get something 
No valentine but my heart beat pumpin’ (pumpin’, pumpin’) 
Now the room poppin
Got plenty views if you hang around me 
So many hearts if you see the IG 
Stung many times by the people that I rate
that my record look great like Mohammed Ali
I’m tryna go, I’m tryna get wavy
On holiday I’m wanting this daily 
Man’s bait when he’s wearing that paisley
Still great coz my living now pays me
Don’t cook but my chef like Ainsley
No look ting when i'm shooting my babies
Top striker, I’m hardly missing
New car so we need to christen, listen..
 
Craig David: 
Is it really love, is it all in my mind
Is it crazy I think of you all of the time, baby 
Is it really love, can you give me a sign
Cause I’m losin’ my head tryna make you mine 
 
Is it really love, is it all in my mind
Is it crazy I think of you all of the time, baby 
Is it really love, can you give me a sign
Cause I’m losin’ my head tryna make you mine, ohhh 
 
KSI: 
Obsessed with the fitness 
That booty got me movin’ with the stiffness 
Prayin’ that I finally get to hit this (Craig David: Tryna make you mine, ohh)
Wreckin’ my balls, Miley 
Makin’ a storm, Kylie 
Showing the fans I’m the only 
Then clockin the wrist with the timing 
Doin’ it bless, doin’ it easy 
Doin’ it best, doin’ it genie 
I got the juice and I’ll give you the world 
Granting' your wishes and doing it well
Let me know when you get freaky
Wanna see E.T,
Give you my number to bell
I got so many to choose
Which one you want
Cause I’m smitten and under your spell
 
Craig David: 
Tryna hold it down but enough's enough
I ain’t really used to this thing called love
But I ain’t afraid to admit I’m feeling so vulnerable
So whatever you decide, let me know what’s the vibe
Cause I’m losin’ my head tryna make you mine, oh
 
Craig David: 
Is it really love, is it all in my mind
Is it crazy I think of you all of the time, baby 
Is it really love, can you give me a sign
Cause I’m losin’ my head tryna make you mine 
 
Is it really love, is it all in my mind
Is it crazy I think of you all of the time, baby 
Is it really love, can you give me a sign
Cause I’m losin’ my head tryna make you mine, ohhh

Letra de ""11 Y 6""

En un café se vieron por casualidad
cansados en el alma de tanto andar
ella tenía un clavel en la mano.
El se acercó, le preguntó si andaba bien
llegaba a la ventana en puntas de pie
y la llevó a caminar por Corrientes.
Miren todos, ellos solos
pueden más que el amor
y son más fuertes que el Olimpo.
Se escondieron en el centro
y en el baño de un bar sellaron todo, todo con un beso.
Durante un mes vendieron rosas en ""La Paz""
presiento que no importaba nada más
y entre los dos juntaban algo.
No sé por qué pero jamás los volví a ver
él carga con 11 y ella con 6
y si reía, el le daba la luna.
Miren todos, ellos solos
pueden más que el amor
y son más fuertes que el Olimpo.
Se escondieron en el centro
y en el baño de un bar sellaron todo, todo, todo, todo con un beso...

""A Rodar Mi Vida'' (Fito Paez)

Se me hacía tarde, ya me iba,
siempre se hace tarde en la ciudad.
Cuando me di cuenta estaba vivo,
vivo para siempre, de verdad.

Hoy compré revistas en el centro,
no pensaba en nada, nada más,
y caí que al fin esto es un juego,
todo empieza siempre una vez más.

Y a rodar, y a rodar, y a rodar,
y a rodar mi vida,
y a rodar, y a rodar, y a rodar,
y a rodar mi amor.
Yo no sé dónde va,
yo no sé donde va mi vida,
yo no sé donde va,
pero tampoco creo que sepas vos.

Quiero salir, yo quiero vivir,
quiero dejar una suerte de señal.
Si un corazón triste pudo ver la luz,
si hice más liviano el peso de tu cruz,
nada más me importa en esta vida, uh,
chau, hasta mañana.

Y a rodar, y a rodar, y a rodar,
y a rodar mi vida,
y a rodar, y a rodar, y a rodar,
y a rodar mi amor.
Yo no sé dónde va,
yo no sé donde va mi vida,
yo no sé donde va,
pero tampoco creo que sepas vos.

Quiero salir, yo quiero vivir,
quiero dejar una suerte de señal.
Si un corazón triste pudo ver la luz,
si hice más liviano el peso de tu cruz,
nadie tiene a nadie, yo te tengo aún
dentro de mi alma, siento que me amas,
chau, hasta mañana.

Shana, shanana, shana, shanana.
Shana, shanana, shana, shanana.
Shana, shanana, shana, shanana.
Shana, shanana, shana, shanana.

""Al Lado del Camino'' (Fito Paez)

Me gusta estar al lado del camino
fumando el humo mientras todo pasa
Me gusta abrir los ojos y estar vivo
Haber sobrevivido a otra resaca
Entonces navegar se hace preciso
En barcos que se estrellen en la nada
Vivir atormentado de sentido, creo que ésta, sí,
Ésta es la parte más pesada
En tiempos donde nadie escucha a nadie
En tiempos donde todos contra todos
En tiempos egoístas y mezquinos
En tiempos donde siempre estamos solos
Habrá que declararse incompetente
En todas las materias del mercado
Habrá que declararse un inocente
Y habrá que ser abyecto y desalmado
Yo ya no pertenezco a ningún ismo
Me considero vivo y enterrado
Yo puse las canciones en tu walkman
El tiempo a mí me puso algunos años
Tendré que hacer lo que es, y no, debido
Tendré que hacerte el bien, tendré que hacerte  daño
No olvides que el perdón es lo divino
Y errar a veces suele ser humano
No es bueno nunca hacerse de enemigos
Que no estén a la altura del conflicto
Que piensan que hacen una guerra
Y se hacen pis encima como chicos
Que rondan por siniestros ministerios
Haciendo la parodia del artista
Que todo lo que brilla en este mundo
Tan solo les da caspa y les da envidia
Yo era un pibe triste y encantado
De Beatles, caña Legui y maravillas
Los libros, las canciones y los pianos,
El cine, las traiciones, los enigmas
Mi padre, las cervezas, las pastillas, los misterios, el whisky malo,
Los óleos, el amor, los escenarios
El hambre, el frío, el crimen, el dinero y mis diez tías
Me hicieron este hombre entreverado
Si alguna vez me cruzas por la calle
Regalame tu beso y no te aflijas
Si ves que estoy pensando en otra cosa
No es nada malo es que paso una brisa
La brisa de la Muerte enamorada
Que ronda como un ángel asesino
Mas no te asustes, nena, siempre se me pasa
Es solo la intuición de mi destino
Me gusta estar al lado del camino
Fumando el humo mientras todo pasa
Me gusta regresarme del olvido
Para acordarme en sueños de mi casa
El chico que jugaba a la pelota
Del 49585
Nadie nos prometio un jardín de rosas
Hablamos del peligro de estar vivos
No vine a divertir a tu familia
Mientras el mundo se cae a pedazos
Me gusta estar al lado del camino
Me gusta sentirte a mi lado
Me gusta estar al lado del camino
Dormirte cada noche entre mis brazos
Al lado del camino
Al lado del camino
Al lado del camino
Es más entretenido y más barato
Al lado del camino.

""Dar Es Dar"" (Fito Paez)

Dar es dar
y no fijarme en ella
y su manera de actuar
Dar es dar
y no decirle a nadie
si quedarse o escapar.
Cuando el mundo me pregunta
del por qué, por qué, por qué, por qué,
por qué das vueltas la rueda
y yo, qué sé?
yo te digo que dar es dar.
Dar es dar
y no marcar las cartas, simplemente dar
dar es dar y no explicarle nada a nadie,
no hay nada que explicar.
Hoy los tiempos van a mil
y tu extraño corazón ya no capta como
antes las pulsiones del amor.
Yo te digo que dar es dar,
yo te digo que dar es amar.
dar es dar
Dar lo que tengo todo me da
da, da, da ,da, da ,da , da, da
no cuento el vuelto siempre es de más
da, da, da ,da, da ,da , da, da
dar es dar,
es solamente mi manera de andar
Dar es dar, lo que recibo de vos
es también libertad.
Cuando estoy perdido un poco loco por
ahí, siempre hay alguien con tus ojos,
esperándome hasta el fin
porque dar es dar,
porque dar es amar
Gracias nena por tu vida una vez más
dar es dar
Dar lo que tengo todo me da
da, da, da ,da, da ,da , da, da
no cuento el vuelto, siempre es de más
da, da, da ,da, da ,da , da, da
cielo o infierno, lo mismo da
da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
estar de menos o estar de más
da, da, da ,da, da ,da , da, da
Dar es dar, dar es dar

""Brillante Sobre el Mic'' (Fito Paez)

Hay recuerdos que no voy a borrar,
personas que no voy a olvidar, uh.
Hay aromas que me quiero llevar,
silencios que prefiero callar, uh.

Son dos, las caras de la luna son dos,
prefiero que sigamos, mi amor,
presos de este sol.

Dejar, amar, llorar,
el tiempo nos ayuda a olvidar.
Y allá, el tiempo que me lleva hacia allá,
el tiempo es un efecto fugaz, uh.

Y hay, yeah, hay cosas que no voy a olvidar,
la noche que dejaste de actuar,
sólo para darme amor,
para darme amor, para darme amor.

Yo vi tu corazón
brillante sobre el mic en una mano,
y ausente de las cosas pensaste en dejarlo
y tirarlo junto a mí, junto a mí.

Hay secretos en el fondo del mar,
personas que me quiero llevar,
aromas que no voy a olvidar,
silencios que prefiero callar,
mientras vos jugás.

""Tu Vida Mi Vida"" (Fito Paez)

Ella se divide en dos,
la sombra y la luz del mundo,
sus ojos son un mar profundo,
hoy sin ella yo no vería el sol.

Yo escribo aquí, en mi habitación,
y el mundo arde, allí afuera,
por fin llegó la primavera,
nada es imposible con su ilusión.

Cuando se revuelcan nuestras piernas en la cama,
y cuando nuestras pieles se conectan al brillar.
Y cuando sus abrazos y mis manos se entrelazan,
entonces, yo siento que me da su vida.

Nena, cuando estoy con vos,
iluminás el camino.
Hiciste que nuestros destinos
sean uno solo en este amor.

Das tanta, tanta calidez,
sin vos ya no entiendo nada,
tu cuerpo se mete en mi alma
y bailan los secretos del corazón.

Todas las palabras son ingrávidas palabras,
y todo el universo se conecta a nuestro amor.
Y cuando ves que soy un chiquitito ante la nada,
entonces, yo siento que me das tu vida.

Todas las palabras son ingrávidas palabras,
y todo el universo se conecta a nuestro amor.
Y cuando ves que soy un chiquitito ante la nada,
entonces, yo siento que me das tu vida.
Entonces, yo siento, que siento,
que te doy mi vida.

Cuando tu me besas
me siento en el aire
por eso cuando te veo
comienzo a besarte.
Y si te despegas yo me despierto
de ese rico sueño que me dan tus besos.

Besame suavecito , sin prisa y con calma
dame un beso bien profundo que me llegue al alma
dame un beso mas que en mi boca cabe
dame un beso despacito, dame un beso suave

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Undeas!
Lil Ceaser!
Queen B!
That's Me!
Lil' Kim!

[Verse 1]
Yo, I be buyin' 'em V's, so all my girls be eyein' Cease
Comin' backstage, dyin' to get pleased
You got me, I rock thee, Versace and linen
While you stop your grinnin' wit' bunch of foxy women
Why you speed ball with cards, that's invalid
I get clothes, custom made, from a stylist
Cruise in my Lexus Land with no mileage
While you walk the street until your feet get calloused
Take you on a natural high, like a pilot
It be all good, toss your clothes like a salad
When it's all over, put your vote in my ballot
It's my diner, I'm Mel, and you're Alice
Spend a night, in Lil' Cease palace
It be all good as long as you don't act childish
While you standin' there with the Crist' in your cup
If worse come to worse keep this on the hush, uhh

[Chorus]
I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin' to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you

[Verse 2]
Ayo shorty, won't you go get a bag of the lethal
I'll be undressed in the bra all see through
Why you count your jewels thinkin' I'ma cheat you?
The only one thing I wanna do is freak you
Keep your stone sets, I got my own baguettes
And I'll be doin' things that you won't regret
Lil Kim, the Queen Bee, so you best take heed
Shall I proceed? (Yes indeed!)
I'ma throw shade if I can't get paid
Blow you up to your girl like the Army grenade
You can slide on my ice like the Escapade
And itchy-gitchy-yaya with the marmalade
Who me? Not you, oh yes, who's he?
I even dig yo' man's style, but I love yo' profile
Whisper in your ear and get you all shook up
But don't blush, just keep this on the hush

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
While you tryin' to catch Sea Breeze, I'm in the PV's
All chrome D3's, decked out TV's
CD's with crazy bass, keep my lady laced
Don't be fooled by the baby face
I hope ya not, 'cause your thighs got me hot
Only one plan, that's to rise to the top
I told you before, when I first pursued
I want a interlude, in the nude

[Verse 4]
You know I love the way you feel-a, sip my tequil-a
Works from the dealers, full-length chinchilla
Heat up the clutch, seven-fifty deluxe
Then we speed down the hutch, breakin' trees in the dutch
I'm not the one you sleep wit', to eat quick
Want a cheap trick, better go down to FreakNik
You got to hit me off, buy this girl gifts of course
So I look sick in my six with my Christian LaCroix

[Chorus]

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Undeas!
Lil Ceaser!
Queen B!
That's Me!
Lil' Kim!

[Verse 1]
Yo, I be buyin' 'em V's, so all my girls be eyein' Cease
Comin' backstage, dyin' to get pleased
You got me, I rock thee, Versace and linen
While you stop your grinnin' wit' bunch of foxy women
Why you speed ball with cards, that's invalid
I get clothes, custom made, from a stylist
Cruise in my Lexus Land with no mileage
While you walk the street until your feet get calloused
Take you on a natural high, like a pilot
It be all good, toss your clothes like a salad
When it's all over, put your vote in my ballot
It's my diner, I'm Mel, and you're Alice
Spend a night, in Lil' Cease palace
It be all good as long as you don't act childish
While you standin' there with the Crist' in your cup
If worse come to worse keep this on the hush, uhh

[Chorus]
I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin' to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you

[Verse 2]
Ayo shorty, won't you go get a bag of the lethal
I'll be undressed in the bra all see through
Why you count your jewels thinkin' I'ma cheat you?
The only one thing I wanna do is freak you
Keep your stone sets, I got my own baguettes
And I'll be doin' things that you won't regret
Lil Kim, the Queen Bee, so you best take heed
Shall I proceed? (Yes indeed!)
I'ma throw shade if I can't get paid
Blow you up to your girl like the Army grenade
You can slide on my ice like the Escapade
And itchy-gitchy-yaya with the marmalade
Who me? Not you, oh yes, who's he?
I even dig yo' man's style, but I love yo' profile
Whisper in your ear and get you all shook up
But don't blush, just keep this on the hush

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
While you tryin' to catch Sea Breeze, I'm in the PV's
All chrome D3's, decked out TV's
CD's with crazy bass, keep my lady laced
Don't be fooled by the baby face
I hope ya not, 'cause your thighs got me hot
Only one plan, that's to rise to the top

Lyrics: 
Lookin’ out my window, feelin’ the crescendo
Sunset on a quiet sea
Sittin with the ones that I’ll forever love
We’re waitin’ on a flash of green
And even when the nights got cold
You have always held me close
You’re the only rock that I could ever stand on
You’re the only one for me
 
The sun goes up, the sun comes down
This old world keeps spinnin’ around
I’m here travelin’ down this long and winding road
Seasons come and seasons go
They take me high, then leave me low
But I’m still standing on the only rock I know
You’re my cornerstone
Oh, no matter where I go, my cornerstone
 
Bible by my bedside
Sweatin’ through a long night
Wrestling the hounds of shame
Tryin’ to turn the hands back
On a troublin’ past
Every move I make’s in vein
 
But even in the shifting winds
You are who you’ve always been
You’re the only rock that I could ever stand on
Through it all you remain
 
On Christ, the solid rock I’m standin’
All of the ground is sinking sand
 
You are the only rock I stand on

LYRICS: 
Last night put the heavy on me 
Woke up, and I’m feeling lonely 
This world gotta a way of showin’ me 
Some days it’ll lift you up 
Some days it’ll call your bluff 
Man, most of my days I ain’t got enough 

And all I know is You’re my only hope 

When I’m up, when I’m down 
When the wolves come around 
When my feet hit the ground 
I just need, I just need U 
On my darkest days, when I’m losing faith 
No, it ain’t gonna change 
I just need, I just need U 
Lord, I need U 
Yeah, I just need U 

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
I will fear no evil for thou art with me 
Thy rod and thy staff … 
They comfort me when I’m beat down broken 
Hold my heart when it’s split wide-open 
Turn these eyes to my sole protector 
And break the will of this born defector 

When You pull me closer I come to life 

Ain’t no way this thing gon’ change, it’s U 
I need on my darkest days, when I’m losing faith 
I need U every single day, every breath I take 
I need U

Lyrics:
You made the rain, so when it falls on me
Should I complain, or feel You calling me
It’s all on me to stay
And really catch what You’re showing
It’s my roots that You’re growing
‘Cause life is more than this moment
You are the light, so when the darkness falls
The greatest heights, they never seem so tall no not at all
You’re right, it’s my roots that You’re growing, don’t wanna miss what You’re showing
 
Ain’t no doubt about You
Everywhere that I go
You keep showing up (Lord You)
Make me wanna shout it
You’re the goodness in my life
And Imma tell You my truth
They may come, they may go
You keep showing up (sure do)
Ain’t no doubt about it
You are, You are
The goodness in my life
 
You are the joy
You’re the smile on the face of Your boy
You’re the flowers at that park in Detroit
Still the words on the back of our coins
Let’s make some noise
You cover me, my defender when You’re rolling up Your sleeves
You’re the truth that’s gonna set the captive free
The only King that’s ever chose to bleed, is what I believe
 
Now they keep trying to make Your glory fade
But I ain’t really sweating what they say
 
Through the good and the bad and the ugly
I can still see the sunshine above me
Lord I love all the ways that You love me
You’re the good, You’re the good, You’re the goodness

LYRICS:
I heard your heart
I see your pain 
Out in the dark 
Out in the rain 
Feel so alone 
Feel so afraid 
I heard you pray in Jesus’ name

It may be midnight or mid-day
Never early, never late 
He gon’ stand by what He claim 
I’ve lived enough life to say 

Help is on the way 
(Roundin’the corner)
Help is on the way 
(Comin’ for ya)
Help is on the way
(Yeah, yeah)
I’ve lived enough life to say 
Help is on the way 

Sometimes it’s days 
Sometimes it’s years
Some face a lifetime 
Of falling tears
But He’s in the darkness 
He’s in the cold 
Just like the morning 
He always shows 

Well I’ve seen my share of troubles 
But the Lord ain’t failed me yet
So I’m holding onto the promise y’all 
That He’s rolling up His sleeves again

Rolling up, rolling up 
Rolling up His sleeves again

SONHO MEU
(Yvonne Lara/Delcio Carvalho)
Intérprete: Maria Bethânia, gentilmente cedida por Biscoito Fino e Zeca Pagodinho

Sonho meu, sonho meu
Vai buscar quem mora longe
Sonho meu

Sonho meu, sonho meu
Vai buscar quem mora longe
Sonho meu

Vai mostrar esta saudade
Sonho meu
Com a sua liberdade
Sonho meu
No meu céu a estrela-guia se perdeu
A madrugada fria só me traz melancolia
Sonho meu

Sinto o canto da noite
Na boca do vento
Fazer a dança das flores
No meu pensamento

Traz a pureza de um samba
Sentido, marcado de mágoas de amor
Um samba que mexe o corpo da gente
E o vento vadio embalando a flor

Traz a pureza de um samba
Sentido, marcado de mágoas de amor
Um samba que mexe o corpo da gente
E o vento vadio embalando a flor
Sonho meu

Sonho meu, sonho meu
Vai buscar quem mora longe
Sonho meu

Sonho meu, sonho meu
Vai buscar quem mora longe
Sonho meu

Vai mostrar esta saudade
Sonho meu
Com a sua liberdade
Sonho meu
No meu céu a estrela-guia se perdeu
A madrugada fria só me traz melancolia
Sonho meu

Sinto o canto da noite
Na boca do vento
Fazer a dança das flores
No meu pensamento

Traz a pureza de um samba
Sentido, marcado de mágoas de amor
Um samba que mexe o corpo da gente
E o vento vadio embalando a flor

VERDADE
Nelson Rufino / Carlinhos Santana

Descobri que te amo demais
Descobri em você minha paz
Descobri, sem querer, a vida
Verdade
Pra ganhar teu amor fiz mandinga
E fui à ginga de um bom capoeira
Dei rasteira na sua emoção
Com o teu coração fiz zoeira
Fui à beira de um rio e você
Uma ceia com pão, vinho e flor
Uma luz pra guiar sua estrada
Na entrega perfeita do amor
Verdade
Descobri que te amo demais
Descobri em você minha paz
Descobri, sem querer, a vida
Verdade
Como negar essa linda emoção
Que tanto bem fez pro meu coração
A minha paixão adormecida
Teu amor, meu amor incendeia
Nossa cama parece uma teia
Teu olhar uma luz que clareia
Meu caminho tal qual lua cheia
Eu nem posso pensar te perder
Ai de mim, esse amor terminar
Sem você, minha felicidade
Morreria de tanto penar
Verdade

Hindi Lyrics: bit.ly/3tx5iHl
English Translation: bit.ly/3tvATtc

The track was conceptualised when DIVINE was stuck in an actual traffic jam in the roads of New York. A gritty track with a dark soundscape and a grungy instrumental makes it a true ‘underground’ anthem in every sense of the word. And who better to bring on such a track than Hip-Hop legend, Jadakiss, who is also one of DIVINE’s early influences. The New York rapper is a true OG and is considered by most a ‘Top 5’ rapper of all time.

Shootter:
Hey,

Senda nota, las baby toa’ locas 
Ella me vio rompiendo y se trepo en el way (ah!)

Gente to el mundo quitamo’ al bouncer (woh!)
Griten la solteras dijo el announcer (hey!)
Aquí la movie es R, nunca PG
Se mojan flow Fiji
Terminó pasándole el squeegee (Vo!)

And I’m just happy to be here
Let’s cheer for that

Kiss replied “You got something for that album?” It took me several days because i know i only had one shot to keep his attention and not send over something he aint feeling! I was already back and forth with Murda Beats about a Rowdy Rebel track and a Bobby Shmurder track! (Before Bobby came home) HINT! So the right vibe was created… Kiss did what he does better than anyone else and we was ready! I thought it was important to shoot vid on the block of the TUNNEL! We both had some great memories of many evenings of parting, mean performances and hot cars circling the block! Me and the LOX over the years have had more ups than downs!

The piece is divided into nine sections played with only three definite pauses. Strauss named the sections after selected chapters of the Nietzsche's book:

1.  ""Einleitung"" (Introduction): according to the interpretations, it should represent the Creation or the coming of the new age of the Overman and so, because of its evocative and declaimed aspect, it is led back to the Overman's motto. 
2.  ""Von den Hinterweltlern"" (Of the Hereaftergo'ers): here the brass quote the gregorian cento ""Credo in unum Deum"" or ""I believe in one God"" to represent faith at the top synthesis.
3.  ""Von der großen Sehnsucht"" (Of the Great Longing): maybe it represents the age of ""Sturm und Drang""; here there's a liturgical quotation from ""Magnificat"".
4.  ""Von den Freuden und Leidenschaften"" (Of the Joys and Passions): the word to the strings, at the top tension; the trombones expose the theme of ""Taedium Vitae"".
5.  ""Das Grablied"" (The Grave-Song): part where the strings prevail. 
6.  ""Von der Wissenschaft"" (Of Science): it is a fugue whose subject all only the twelve notes to represent scientism, positivism and maybe, to ridicule the rising dodecaphony.
7.  ""Der Genesende"" (The Convalescent): it completes the tension of the previous movement, then, after a rough pause determined by a rip of the strings in the bass register, it starts again from the mystery to go to the atmosphere of the following movement.
8.  ""Das Tanzlied"" (The Dance Song): the theme of ""Taedium Vitae"" is taken again trasfigured in a waltz.
9.  ""Nachtwandlerlied"" (Song of the Night Wanderer): coda where the finale is suspended avoiding the cadence on the tonic.

LYRICS:
RZA:
Set the time for the battleground
Guided missiles will hunt you down
Drones’ surrounds your homes
Don’t breathe you’re not safe underground
Political landscape shape has been polarized
Now it is time to reveal the zeal
Everybody breath and get mobilized
Radiation beams out your screens
It’s like a poltergeist
Trying to buy the American dream
But it’s overpriced
5 bill deal for the fighter jets
Being shipped to the Middle East
It’ll cost 10 billion more dollars for neighbors
to feels safe to breathe

The Prodigy: Breathe with me
RZA: Sometimes you got to stop and breathe
The Prodigy: Breathe with me
Come breathe with me
RZA: Sometimes you got to stop

RZA:
He pulls on a cigar
He pulls on the strings of his guitar
She pulled on his pants, bam, he pulled on her bra
Breathe (uh uh), if you believe everything under the sun
It was born to be free
The shadow is bound to the tree and
Cannot leave with the traveler
The battle is fought on the daily basis
The sturdy man replaced the straggler
As long as there is a breath of life, there is always hope
Defeat the strife, don’t let go that rope

The Prodigy: Breathe with me
RZA: Sometimes you got to stop and breathe
The Prodigy: Breathe with me
Come breathe with me
RZA: Sometimes you got to stop and breathe
The Prodigy: Come breathe with me

Quentin Tarantino Lyrics:

Chorus:
He walks the streets at night, his shadow follows him in the moonlight
He only travels at night and he hides during the daylight
Zombie Juice
Once upon a time before my skin color was a crime, so sublime
Read through these akashic lines
So many blessings, I’m in my four cornered room staring at candles, yeah
Feeling like I'm dancin’ in the moonlight
I wear these sunglasses at night, aura too bright
Triumphant, from dusk til dawn, always hustlin’ n*****
The evolution will be digitized
Bobby hit em with rhythm, linguistics to hypnotize
The image, so vivid, baby check out my gravity
The way I be livin’, just tryin’ to get more clarity
Who killed Bill? They shot Kennedy
Malcolm laying dead like how they gon level the playin’ field?
In Glorious all cap, vicarious live through me
They hateful, envious, but they schemin’ wont get to we
Been smokin’, got cotton mouth
Ash in my dungarees
Been smokin’, got cotton mouth
Ash in my dungarees
Don’t let this sin wear you out

In the city of gods, speak from the heart
Lead with action, had a frivolous thought
Bismillah peace to my Umi
My grandfather, he live through me
In the night sometimes I feel like its voices talkin’ to me
Connected to a higher power, they couldn’t find me like Assata
Weh dem a do like mavado
And Imma shoot if a gotta, bow
RZA
What the fucks up in that briefcase? (yo)
What the fucks up in that briefcase? (wait)
What the fucks up in that briefcase? (yo)
What the fucks up in that briefcase?
Erick the Architect
Grindhouse, we slaughter refined amounts
How could we be this Hateful there’s only Eight of us now
Bro RZA slid me this Blade
Systems staking us out
They killing us all but we edurel, reservoir dog
I’m Mr. Orange, so since we sparrin’ I put my all in
Your whip be stallin’, unchained, unhandled Django is dormant
They pat me down, n*****, you don’t know you better ask around
It’s been half an hour, blast the sound, where’s Jackie Brown ?
They happy now, in staccato cut the convo Desperado
Need to switch the toggle, this an album like a Bible
My arrival like, this a sermon, been determined, read the verbiage
We deserve it, yearning’ for them diamonds, yellow like, Uma Thurman
Load the burner, smokin’ herbs and see my earnings
And we just hit the Wu to reconfirm we need your service n*****
I’m walking on deaf ears, I swear they hear me somehow
They speak to me in this vision I see them floating around
I thought I was proof of death, my Death Proof majestic
Known to especially investigate, we check this method
Unnecessarily they still request it, I still respect it
It’s all subjective, they can't relinquish my effervescence
It’s just my blessings, procure this message
Ego is stretchin’ listen to every single suggestion
It’s sin, in my city, regime link the Wu we redeem
May we move with prestige, you aint rude as it seems
They on a the leash, I’m dragon, they maltese
Don’t envy the fear of man, they mute when a god speak, peace

Bridge: RZA
What the fucks up in that briefcase? (yo)
What the fucks up in that briefcase? (wait)
What the fucks up in that briefcase? (yo)
What the fucks up in that briefcase?
Meechy Darko
The moth has no idea that the fires gonna burn him
But the person, the person know that bullets they be hurtin’
Meechy Tarantino but I used shoot like Kubrick baby
Get a hateful eight, my barrel full I do not do the clips
The grindhouse, the trap spot, one time I seen my broke boy break down crack rock
With a slap chop, Jackie Brown, gats be round
I pray police don’t pat me down or badger me
Please don’t let they badge lead to blam blam casualty (casualty)
Lets move on before we find one of your dogs in a reservoir
A legend, I am death proof, flesh made of teflon
Desperado, dancing in gun fire with my weapon
My true romance is bloodshed and armageddon
New York City n*****, yellow coupe, black stripes
Might just Kill Bill these n******, cut em to pieces, hasta la vista
Can’t rebuild these n*****, from dusk to dawn
My heart froze, never feel these n***** (never feel these n*****)
He walks the streets at night, his shadow follows him in the moonlight
He only travels at night and he hides during the daylight

Masta Killa's Myspace:
http://www.myspace.com/mastakilla

....Get the music there.


Elgin Turner (born August 18, 1969, better known as Masta Killa, is an American rapper and member of the Wu-Tang Clan. Though one of the lesser-known members of the group (he was featured on only one track on their 1993 debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)), due to being incarcerated for most of the album's production, He has been prolific on Clan group albums and solo projects since the mid-1990s, and released his debut album No Said Date in 2004 to positive reviews.

""I never performed until we launched Wu-Tang. That was my first time as an MC. I have history since elementary school doing talent shows. Breaking and shit like that. I was that kind of dude. I loved to pop. That was me. Always doing shit around music. As far as with a mic in my hand, Wu-Tang was the first time. There never was next level for me. It was Wu-Tang and that was it. I never tried to get on. Never looked for any of this, because it was never my vision. I'm kinda like hanging out with GZA, and just stumbled across some shit. Oh word? And I was like, maybe I can do this. When I was young going to clubs, I was just hanging out. I never went in there like I was trying to be an MC. I never tried to get a record deal, or pass out tapes. It's just been Wu-Tang and I'm here.""

Born in Brooklyn, New York, Masta Killa was the last member to join the Wu-Tang Clan; consequently he did not appear on the group's debut single ""Protect Ya Neck"". He was also the only member who was not a rapper at the time of the group's formation. He was extensively mentored by the GZA during his early days with the group, evident in the similar flow they both employ. He derived his rap name from the 1978 kung fu film Shaolin Master Killer, (Shao Lin san shi liu fang). Masta only appeared on one track on the Wu-Tang Clan's first album, through his only verse on the album, the closing verse to ""Da Mystery of Chessboxin"". Masta only narrowly made the track, and was almost left off in favor of Killah Priest. In fact, on the No Said Date DVD, Killah Priest claims that he and Masta Killa were in competition for the spot on ""Da Mystery of Chessboxin'"", and while Killah Priest fell asleep, Masta Killa stayed up all night writing and Killah Priest woke up the next morning to Masta Killa's verse. Since he was a developing rapper at the time Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) was being written, his verse in ""Da Mystery of Chessboxin"" was the only one that could hold up with the other, more experienced Wu-Tang members.

During the first round of solo projects, he made several appearances on tracks now considered Wu-Tang classics, such as ""Winter Warz"", ""Duel of the Iron Mic"", and ""Glaciers of Ice"". His flow at the time attracted attention for being very slow and laid-back, in contrast to the more manic, forceful styles of members like Inspectah Deck and Ghostface Killah. Masta Killa is also the Clansman fondest of Chinese martial arts imagery. In 1997 (1997 in music), the Wu-Tang Clan's second album Wu-Tang Forever saw Masta become a mainstay in the group's line-up with regular appearances throughout the double album.

Masta Killa was the last member to release a solo project, after it was delayed for several years and finally released in June 2004 with the title No Said Date; critically acclaimed, it became independent label Nature Sounds' best-selling album, notable for featuring every core member of the Wu-Tang Clan on the album after a period in the group's history that lacked unity. His second album, Made in Brooklyn, was released in August 8, 2006, and includes production from Pete Rock and MF Doom. ""Ringing Bells"", the Bronze Nazareth-produced lead single from the album, was released in March 2006. Also in 2006, Masta Killa became the latest in a succession of hip hop artists to endorse PETA, also participating in an advertisement for the organization and is also a vegetarian.

In September of 2009, news surfaced of a planned Masta Killa album with production from PF Cuttin. It is entitled Loyalty is Royalty, and the first single ""Things Just Ain't the Same"" was released to the internet",False,False,2345302.0,East Coast hip hop

 ‘Plug Addicts’ Lyrics 
 
 
Verse: Erick the Architect 
 
(yeah, uhhh) 
Plug addicts, they love rappin’ with me 
Zombie gang my regime 
We duck the traffic of D’s 
So I’m chasing the speed 
Another slap on my knee 
Somehow I chose this rappin’ instead of wrappin’ a key 
Mackin’ the G, my shit intact so we tap with our feet 
Rather unique Rza’s craft this immaculate beat 
Blast with the heat, impact with this accuracy  
Last one to sleep, just imagine what happened to me  
Factory made, back to the graves and they microwaves 
The type of shit that make a n***** turn the mic away 
The type of shit that make a n***** take ya life away 
Live now or die today, we aint used to holidays, we aint used to common place 
We aint got no common sense, we aint got no confidence  
Fuck a 9 to 5 a n***** worth the length of monuments 
Lion hearted, tiger face 
Any corner, time and place, architect the time it takes 
Inner-city outta state, and globally we outta space 
 
 
Verse: RZA 
 
Wait up Arc hold up wait 
Never in a sober state 
100k we hold the date, I understand we overtake 
Zombie Juice, coordinate  
We got more dough to make  
Darko n***** hold the weight, flow colder than the Dakota states 
Triple OG, beats, break your fuckin shoulder blade 
Strings gliding like n***** upon a rollerblade 
 
 
Verse: Meechy Darko 
 
Killin’ you n*****, pass the shovel, I’m diggin’ your ditches 
Pitiful, I leave you critical, under one condition  
I threw my doggy off the roof, he wouldn’t fetch my paper  
Black Rambo, in Nike vandals, expand coke, that’s not love 
Glocked tucked, shooting slow motion like John Woo flicks 
White doves, black gloves, cut the tongues off loose lips  
Piss on your grave, suck your mother,  I give two shits 
Might rob your favorite rapper, momma need rent for her new whip 
Never was a little n*****, signed my own permission slips  
The acid hits by sunrise, n***** that’s a day trip 
Close your eyes, imagine if n***** lived out,  
just exactly what they’re rappin’ and you have to stand 
From What you press on vinyl packaging  
Buck 140 a rappers face & tell his shorty keep the change 
I cannot be tamed  
 
 
Verse: Zombie Juice 
 
This a murder scene turn this shit to (screams) 
I’m in the passenger, my bitch drunk she feelin’ good  
Smellin’ sweet like lavender  
I’ve got a body in the trunk, had to check for cameras  
And the weed was kinda skunk  
Hope we don't get stopped for nothin’, see the cops we gotta run 
Put the pedal to the floor, got a shovel and a saw 
We can hack em into pieces burn em up buried in feces  
Black suit like John Wick, she got the braid like tomb raider  
I check the news we targets, interviews with our neighbors 
Hope we make it out the state before they set up checkpoints  
Aint tryin’ to see them big gates, wont let them take me alive 
And if you snitched on me bitch I hope it eats you alive 
Text abuela, we’ll see you manana, don't worry nana 
Cant use our credit cards because they track all the places 
But we runnin’ outta gas and we can't hide our faces 
Shit you see them blue lights, she said don't think we can make it  
Shots fired, woke up on the hospital bed  
Enemy of the state, cop killer what they said  
 
Plug addicts they love rappin’ with me

An alle meine Gringos: Back to the roots
Ich stolp're durch's Leben vor lauter Packets in den Boots
Dass ich genial bin, Holmes, hat mit Rappen nix zutun
Ich kann alles, was ich will, ich bin flächendeckend cool
Zurück zum Thema, den Packs in mein' Tretern
Komm in der Pause bei und ich vercheck' dir dein' Zehner
Immer korrekt, nie gestreckt, weil das nich' klar geht
Marathon Smoker, bei uns nennt man sowas ""Athlet""
Während mein Herz im Viervierteltakt schlägt
Wiege ich das Paket, puff Haze, was geht?
Zeug, dass man durch Gitterstäbe in' Knast trägt
Dieses Gift in den Zell'n macht Krebs
Achtzehn Jahre und du glaubst
Dass du weißt, wohin der Hase läuft
Bau' nicht so viel Scheiße, lass die Finger von dem harten Zeug
Jemand anders sein ist leicht und nix besonderes
Schwer ist nur man selbst zu sein ohne Kompromiss, yoa

Ich stolpere durch's Leben vor lauter Packets in den Boots
Vor lauter Packets in den Boots
Maske oder nicht, ich bleib' ich, yo, yo, yo (Yeah)
Maske oder nicht, ich bleib ich, yo (Genetikk)
Ich bleib' ich, yo 
Die Packs in meinen Tretern

De-generic, not athletic, pathetic
Anti-semitic, synthetic rapper deserve no credit
It's not embedded in their genetics
It´s with their proper hip-hop should he only speak the rhetoric
It's MC Karuzo, DJ Sikk produces jo
Music make the girls just ooze out their juice hole
Wu-Tang-Slang gets spreaded
You weaklings you get beheaded, shredded
Wetted down, tatted, tattered
Dipped and beer-battered, you inglorious bastards
You get your ears shattered
Now watch, all you, I've said it
Sippin' on a Heineken, chasin' with a Vicodin
Bring so much pain that they won't touch the mic again
Learn from me, hip-hop raised eternally
Wu-Tang, Genetikk: USA and Germany

Ich stolpere durch's Leben vor lauter Packets in den Boots
Vor lauter Packets in den Boots
Maske oder nicht, ich bleib' ich, yo, yo, yo
Maske oder nicht, ich bleib ich, yo
Ich bleib' ich, yo, die Packs in meinen Tretern

Ich werd' niemals dreißig, doch darauf scheiß' ich
Wetten, in Witten gilt mein Shit als dick, kalt und eisig
Ich bin kein weiser Mann, aber ich kann euch versprechen
Was aus einer Katze kriecht, wird immer Mäuse fressen
Bringt eure Besten, degradiere sie am Fließband
Ganz ohne Machine Gun, mach' einfach nur den Beat an
Aus den Speakern ballern Silben, bist du kugelsicher?
Ich hör nich' auf, bis ich nicht jede deutsche Crew gefickt hab
Wie lange noch? Ich mach' weiter, bis die Taschen platzen
""Bis die Taschen platzen?"" Ja, bis die Taschen platzen
Ich scheiß auf jeden, ihr seid alles keine Member
Macht Mukke für den Sommer, ich nur für November
Immer wenn es regnet, musst du an mich denken
Von Bling-Bling und Strass lasse ich mich nicht blenden
Eure Welt ist bunt, alle sind glücklich und zufrieden
Dann sag mir, warum gibt es auf der Welt keine Liebe? Yoa

LYRICS: 
 SUNSET THROUGH A WINDSHIELD I CAN SEE IT NOW
LIKE A PICTURE IN A FRAME 
BLUE JEANS AND T-SHIRTS - WHO WE WERE, WE WORE IT LIKE A NAME
I WISH I COULD GO BACK TO THOSE DAYS WHEN
 
THAT TOWN WAS THE WHOLE WORLD - LOVE WAS THE GIRL NEXT DOOR 
SOUNDTRACK WAS A SONG IN THE DARK
I MISS THOSE DAYS WHEN OUR DREAMS WERE THERE FOR CHASIN'
BUT TIME WAS BETTER WASTED
WE WERE SUMMER YOUNG AND LIVIN' FOR A FRIDAY
AND FREEDOM WAS A HIGHWAY 
FREEDOM WAS A HIGHWAY 
 
BARBWIRE ON AFENCE-POSTS WITH A CROSS-WIND 
ON A ROAD NO ONE WAS ON 
FIVE-DEEP WITH OUR HANDS UP JUST SINGIN' ALONG TO A HIP HOP SONG
I WISH I COULD REWIND AND REPLAY WHEN 
 
THE TOWN WAS THE WHOLE WORLD - LOVE WAS THE GIRL NEXT DOOR 
SOUNDTRACK WAS A SONG IN THE DARK
I MISS THOSE DAYS WHEN OUR DREAMS WERE THERE FOR CHASIN'
BUT TIME WAS BETTER WASTED
WE WERE SUMMER YOUNG AND LIVIN' FOR A FRIDAY
AND FREEDOM WAS A HIGHWAY 
FREEDOM WAS A HIGHWAY 
 
WHEN YOU'RE 17 AND DRIVIN' YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT THE ROAD RUNNIN' OUT
NO, NO, NO, NO
YOU JUST SET YOUR EYES ON THAT HORIZON CUZ YOU'RE WRAPPED UP IN THE NOW 
 
BUT I WISH I COULD GO BACK TO THOSE DAYS WHEN 
THE TOWN WAS THE WHOLE WORLD - LOVE WAS THE GIRL NEXT DOOR 
SOUNDTRACK WAS A SONG IN THE DARK
I MISS THOSE DAYS WHEN OUR DREAMS WERE THERE FOR CHASIN'
BUT TIME WAS BETTER WASTED
WE WERE SUMMER YOUNG AND LIVIN' FOR A FRIDAY
AND FREEDOM WAS A HIGHWAY  
FREEDOM WAS A HIGHWAY  
FREEDOM WAS A HIGHWAY, BABY
FREEDOM WAS A HIGHWAY  
FREEDOM WAS A HIGHWAY  
FREEDOM WAS A HIGHWAY

Lyrics:

She's a yellow pair of running shoes
A holey pair of jeans
She looks great in cheap sunglasses
She looks great in anything
She's I want a piece of chocolate
Take me to a movie
She's I can't find a thing to wear
Now and then she's moody

She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land
And a good feeling knowing
She's a warm conversation
That I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad
And she's a lover when she's loving

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
'Cause she's everything to me",True,True,113807657.0,country music

Lyrics:

he put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night

He put that bottle to his head and pulled thetrigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said I'll love her till I die
And when we buried himbeneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby

Lyrics:

I've got some big news
The bank finally came through
And I'm holdin' the keys to abrand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside it sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake

There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl, I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires

'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires",True,True,95439261.0,country music

Lyrics:

We didn't care if people stared
We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room
It's hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that we're okay
But I don't want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then I wanna feel that way again

Been so long that you'd forget the way I used to kiss your neck
Remind me, remind me
So on fire so in love. Way back when we couldn't get enough
Remind me, remind me

Lyrics:

When I get where I'm going
On the far side of the sky
The first thing that I'm gonna do
Is spread my wings and fly

I'm gonna land beside a lion
And run my fingers through his mane
Or I might find out what it's like
To ride a drop of rain

Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
