LYRICS:
We‚Äôve been swinging and missin‚Äô
It ain‚Äôt broke yet
But damn it needs fixin‚Äô
Been awhile since your kiss felt like kissing
It‚Äôs just different
We‚Äôve been talking bout forever
Since we‚Äôve been together
Something bout a ring
Makes you think we‚Äôre better off with
All this
But we‚Äôre caught in

Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rolling down your face
When I walked out that door
That‚Äôs when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn I‚Äôm exhausted
What the hell‚Äôs this all for
Is this where it mends or it breaks
Between a rock and a hard place

For the record, shit
Throwing in the towel takes some effort
So I‚Äôd rather ride it out for better weather
Together

Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rolling down your face
When I walked out that door
That‚Äôs when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn I‚Äôm exhausted
What the hell‚Äôs this all for
Is this where it mends or it breaks
Between a rock and a hard place

We‚Äôve been talking bout forever
Since we‚Äôve been together
Something bout a ring
That makes you think we‚Äôre better off with
All this
But we‚Äôre caught in

Between a rock and a hard place
Tears rolling down your face
As I walked out the door
That‚Äôs when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn I‚Äôm exhausted
What the hell‚Äôs this all for
Is this where it mends or it breaks
How much more of this can we take

Establishing himself as one of music‚Äôs most exciting new voices, Bailey Zimmerman strikes a sweet spot between timeless American country, rafter-rattling arena rock, and authentic storytelling. It‚Äôs why in just one year‚Äôs time, he‚Äôs already logged over 400 million global streams, notched two entries on the Billboard Hot 100, and immediately sold out his first headline tour. Growing up in the small town of Louisville, IL, Zimmerman embraced country music on long-haul truck rides with his dad, and 80‚Äôs hair rock at home with his mom. By the time he hit high school, Zimmerman learned old school American values of hard work and dependability through a gig at the local meat market and long hours on a union gas pipeline. Simultaneously, he discovered his natural musical talent and began to sing whenever there was a guitar nearby. After a garage-recorded demo of his song ‚ÄúNever Comin‚Äô Home‚Äù amassed over a million plays overnight, he turned in his union card to fulfill a growing demand for new music. Zimmerman fueled his meteoric rise with anthemic singles including, ‚ÄúFall In Love‚Äù, ‚ÄúRock and A  Hard Place‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWhere It Ends‚Äù. Now, this young artist with the rasp of a seasoned rocker and the heart of a sensitive songwriter has arrived at the cusp of superstardom as he readies his forthcoming debut for Warner Music Nashville/Elektra Records.

LYRICS:
Heard you moved out to South Carolina just like you always said we would.
Packed your bags in that ol‚Äô 4 runner that I bought ya when things were good.
I‚Äôm glad to see the stop sign didn‚Äôt hit ya bring ya back to your senses
Ohhh it waved you gone goodbye.
Yeah it waved you gone goodbye.
 
I heard you found yourself a brand new man
Put a rock on your finger and he vowed you a second chance.
Built a house right by the coast
That ocean view is beautiful but baby I just want you to know.
He don‚Äôt know you like I did.
Money talks but I ain‚Äôt buying.
 
Loves a smoke ring wrapped around your finger
One second it‚Äôs a blessing and the next it‚Äôs already gone.
A broken heart I‚Äôm a walking testimony
My confession is a lesson that I‚Äôm pouring out in this song.
Oh woah woah
Oh woah woah
You don‚Äôt wanna fall in love.
 
Seen your momma walking out the county market and I stopped to ask her how she‚Äôs been.
Said she‚Äôs missing ya and tried to go convincing ya not to settle down with him.
She ain‚Äôt wrong, the whole town knows it, you had a bed of roses
But girl you couldn‚Äôt walk that line.
You can act like you‚Äôre doing fine.

LYRICS:
Rumor round town
You've been getting down
With some ole boy at the bar
Heard he looks like me
Bet your daddy's so proud
He won't get you very far
 
You ain't nothing like your momma
Girl you're so full of drama
And I've got you on your knees
Begging baby come back
I didn't mean that
Saying that you miss me
 
Been on the road for ten months now
Tuesday of next week
The nerve you had to go behind my back
Girl you're lying straight through your teeth
Lights, camera, action
Karma's back at it
And you're jumping back to we
'Cause that ole boy done did you dirty
The same way you did me
 
And I've got you blowing up my phone
'Cause you don't wanna be alone
Closed that door on me
And I ain't never comin' home
Oh, no
Ain't never comin' home
I've said goodbye
Don't make me say it twice
Now I'm a rolling stone
And I ain't never comin' home
Never comin' home
 
Girl we were shining then you two timed it
Two facing me oh, ya shady baby
Why ya trying ain't no silver lining
Coming back to me? Don't be crazy baby
 
And I've got you blowing up my phone
Cause you don't wanna be alone
Closed that door on me
And I ain't never comin' home
 
Ho, home
 
And I've got you blowing up my phone
'Cause you don't wanna be alone
Closed that door on me
And I ain't never comin' home
Oh, no
I ain't never comin' home
I've said goodbye
Don't make me say it twice
Now I'm a rolling stone
And I ain't never Comin' home
Oh, no
 
Ain't never, never, never comin' home

LYRICS:
Yeah we‚Äôre only human
But that don‚Äôt mean that we can‚Äôt change
I can hurt you
You can hurt me
But we feel each other‚Äôs pain
And that‚Äôs what makes us human
That I can break you‚Äôre heart in two
And still love you
Through all the days we‚Äôve
Been gettin‚Äô through

For both our sake
Let‚Äôs put love back in it‚Äôs place

I won‚Äôt give up on you
So darlin‚Äô don‚Äôt give up on me
Don‚Äôt you wanna stay
Don‚Äôt just walk away
From our memories
And I can‚Äôt promise nothing
But the rest of me
I‚Äôll fight for you
I‚Äôll fight for us
I‚Äôll fight to
Never leave

And life don‚Äôt make it easy
But you‚Äôre the reason my heart beats
You swore you‚Äôd never leave me
So I‚Äôve been thinking it‚Äôd be easy
To get down on one knee

For both our sake
Let‚Äôs put love back in it‚Äôs place

I won‚Äôt give up on you
So darlin‚Äô don‚Äôt give up on me
Don‚Äôt you wanna stay
Don‚Äôt just walk away
From our memories
And I can‚Äôt promise nothing
But the rest of me
I‚Äôll fight for you
I‚Äôll fight for us
I‚Äôll fight to
Never leave

I promise not to let you fall
I said that I would give my all
And you know that won‚Äôt change
Yeah it will always be the same

I won‚Äôt give up on you
So darlin‚Äô don‚Äôt give up on me
Don‚Äôt you wanna stay
Don‚Äôt just walk away
From the memories
And I can‚Äôt promise nothing
But the rest of me
I‚Äôll fight for you

LYRICS:
Too little, too late
The wind cries can't make you stay
Blue eyes drowning out the flame
And red lights crashing at your name
 
Flashbacks and memories
Shatter like glass into you and me
Now I'm tryna find a life with meaning
Picking up the pieces
 
'Cause I'm tired of being broken
Living in a home with a heart so hopeless
While you're crying, I'm trying
Everything I can
And I'm tired of being so close
Living in a world where I want to let go
Take my pain with your name
And throw it all away
 
'Cause everything we were yesterday
Is everything I wanna change
 
Your shadow that goes to blame
Chasing me down, it won't fade away
If having everything means leaving
Then baby you're the reason
 
That I'm tired of being broken
Living in a home with a heart so hopeless
While you're crying, I'm trying
Everything I can
And I'm tired of being so close
Living in a world where I want to let go
Take my pain with your name
And throw it all away
 
'Cause everything we were yesterday
Is everything I wanna change
 
'Cause I'm tired of being broken
Living in a home with a heart so hopeless
While you're crying, I'm trying
Everything I can
And I'm tired of being so close
Living in a world where I want to let go
Take my pain with your name
And throw it all away
 
'Cause everything we were yesterday
Is everything I wanna change
 
'Cause I'm tired of being so close
Living in a world where I want to let go
'Cause I'm tired of being broken

Warner Music Nashville / Elektra Music Group breakout country artist Bailey Zimmerman is following an explosive trajectory after an unexpected, whirlwind rise. In just one year since releasing his viral sensation ‚ÄúNever Comin‚Äô Home,‚Äù the first song he‚Äôd ever written or performed, the rising singer/songwriter has already earned more than 100 million global streams to date and charted his latest release, ‚ÄúFall In Love,‚Äù on the Billboard Hot 100. Born and raised in the small town of Louisville, IL, he grew up listening to hour after hour of country radio on long hauls across state lines with his father, who owned a trucking business. Back at home his mom instilled in him a life-long appreciation for the power chords and edgy vocals of 80‚Äôs hair rock. From long hours on the gas pipeline, to late nights of backbreaking roadwork, Zimmerman embodies the old school American values of hard work and dependability and applies the same steadfast mentality to his music. Through his plainspoken charm, contagious enthusiasm and genuine portrayal of life on the back roads, the up-and-comer has already attracted a loyal and passionate fan base. With more new music on the horizon, featuring the grit and gravel of his unmistakably Southern drawl, Zimmerman will continue to showcase the straightforward authenticity for which he is known and loved.

LYRICS:
We‚Äôve been swinging and missin‚Äô
It ain‚Äôt broke yet
But damn it needs fixin‚Äô
Been awhile since your kiss felt like kissing
It‚Äôs just different
We‚Äôve been talking bout forever
Since we‚Äôve been together
Something bout a ring
Makes you think we‚Äôre better off with
All this
But we‚Äôre caught in

Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rolling down your face
When I walked out that door
That‚Äôs when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn I‚Äôm exhausted
What the hell‚Äôs this all for
Is this where it mends or it breaks
Between a rock and a hard place

For the record, shit
Throwing in the towel takes some effort
So I‚Äôd rather ride it out for better weather
Together

Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rolling down your face
When I walked out that door
That‚Äôs when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn I‚Äôm exhausted
What the hell‚Äôs this all for
Is this where it mends or it breaks
Between a rock and a hard place

We‚Äôve been talking bout forever
Since we‚Äôve been together
Something bout a ring
That makes you think we‚Äôre better off with
All this
But we‚Äôre caught in

Between a rock and a hard place
Tears rolling down your face
As I walked out the door
That‚Äôs when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn I‚Äôm exhausted
What the hell‚Äôs this all for
Is this where it mends or it breaks
How much more of this can we take

LYRICS
Look out for yourself!

I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I‚Äôm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world, that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you‚Äôre the greatest
But once you turn they hate us

Oh, the misery!
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy... y... y... y...
Look out for yourself!
My enemy... y... y... y...
Look out for yourself!
But I‚Äôm ready

Your words up on the wall, as you‚Äôre praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls, and the names that I‚Äôve been called
I stack it in my mind, and I‚Äôm waiting for the time
When I show you what it‚Äôs like, to be words spit in a mic!
Tell you you‚Äôre the greatest
But once you turn they hate us

Oh, the misery!
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be 
My enemy... y... y... y...
Look out for yourself!
My enemy... y... y... y...
Look out for yourself!

Look, okay
I‚Äôm hoping that somebody pray for me
I‚Äôm praying that somebody hope for me
I‚Äôm staying where nobody ‚Äòposed to be
P-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever just let me know
The road is long so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy‚Äôs on my trail, my energy unavailable
Imma tell ‚Äòem hasta luego

They wanna plot on my trot to the top, 
I‚Äôve been outta shape, thinkin‚Äô out the box
I‚Äôm an astronaut, I blasted off the planet rock
To cause Catastrophe and it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shockin‚Äô they wanted static with precision
I‚Äôm automatic quarterback, I ain‚Äôt talkin‚Äô sacking
Pack it, pack it up, Iont panic, batter batter up
Who the baddest, it don‚Äôt matter, cause we at ya throat

Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
Oh, the misery!
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be 
My enemy

They say pray it away, I swear, I‚Äôll never be a Saint, no way
My enemy
They say pray it away, I swear, I‚Äôll never be a Saint

Look out for yourself!

Who told you what was down here?
Come along, if you wanted a peek

I‚Äôve seen your face around here
Come alone, tell me under the table
What do you seek?

Welcome to the playground, follow me
Tell me your nightmares and fantasies
Sink into the wasteland underneath
Stay for the night, I‚Äôll sell you a dream

Ohh... Welcome to the playground

What brings you to the lost and found, dear?
Won‚Äôt you pull up a seat?
Everybody got a price ‚Äôround here to play
Make me an offer, what will it be?

Oh... what will it be?

I can hear the sound of a heartbeat before it goes out
Won‚Äôt ever leave my memory of bloodshed all around
I can see a tear on my father‚Äôs face before it falls out
Oh my enemy, how could I have ever let you down, oh
When all these trees saw us grow, cut our teeth, and make our bones right here
We‚Äôd play with shields made of stone, share our dreams and sit our thrones

Be still, ‚Äôcause I see smoke up ahead and I got steel in my hands
We will return like warriors I swear that we‚Äôll find glory up ahead

Tell me, where is my home? I don‚Äôt recognize the faces anymore, no
Where is my friend? The one I‚Äôve known since I was only just a kid

LYRICS
Know you got my blood running
Turn the heat to 600
Wish I could knock your skull in
But I‚Äôm rising above it
Know you‚Äôll crash it and burn it
God knows you didn‚Äôt earn it
My friend karma‚Äôs a bitch
She‚Äôs got some lessons you‚Äôll learn ‚Äòem

NOW WE'RE ENEMIES

You‚Äôre a snake, you‚Äôre a snake
I can see it in your face

Do you feel no shame?
Can‚Äôt you see my rage?
You‚Äôre a snake, you‚Äôre a snake
Just like a spitting image
Fate, how‚Äôs it taste?
It‚Äôs your own medicine
Make no mistake
Got 20/20 vision
If I see your face
Don't think I‚Äôm forgiving

It‚Äôs time we had a discussion
‚ÄòBout your sorry production
Mask your shade and corruption
Grinning teeth lack seduction
Know the crime you committed
I forget not forgive it
Don‚Äôt you dare get it twisted
I‚Äôm nice but I can get wicked

NOW WE'RE ENEMIES

Do you feel no shame?
Can‚Äôt you see my rage?
You‚Äôre a snake, you‚Äôre a snake
Just like a spitting image
Fate, how‚Äôs it taste?
It‚Äôs your own medicine
Make no mistake
Got 20/20 vision
If I see your face
Don't think I‚Äôm forgiving

You‚Äôre a snake, you‚Äôre a snake
I can see it in your face
You‚Äôre a snake, you‚Äôre a snake

LYRICS

Who told you what was down here?
Come along, if you wanted a peek

I‚Äôve seen your face around here
Come alone, tell me under the table
What do you seek?

Welcome to the playground, follow me
Tell me your nightmares and fantasies
Sink into the wasteland underneath
Stay for the night, I‚Äôll sell you a dream

Ohh... Welcome to the playground

Welcome to the wasteland
Me and my people don‚Äôt shake hands
We just swallow souls
And slime foes
Like snakes dance
And we won‚Äôt stop till
You got wrinkles
And gray strands
So I hope you coming up
With a decent escape plan
Cause once you down here it‚Äôs like
Ain‚Äôt nobody heard of you
I could take your life and
I don‚Äôt even have to murder you
I could kill a bird or two
One stone
Please lemme get my gun drawn
Please lemme get my cuss on
You better get yo hush on
So what ya say now don‚Äôt waste my time
Cause on this playground it ain‚Äôt no slides

Welcome to the playground, follow me
Tell me your nightmares and fantasies
Sink into the wasteland underneath
Stay for the night, I‚Äôll sell you a dream

Ohh... Welcome to the playground
Ohh... Welcome to the playground

LYRICS

There‚Äôs a girl in town, and words gone around
She‚Äôs just fine. So I don‚Äôt worry my head
Cause I know her heart is tied to mine
The life that we live, and the love that I give to her
Each day it grows more and more I‚Äôm sure, it shows, well...

Our love, is a bubbling fountain
Our love , that flows into a sea
Our love, deeper than any ocean
Our love, for eternity

Ooo, like Sunday I pray our love will always stay pure
While the world turns around he holds me down for sure

Our love, is a bubbling fountain
Our love, that flows into a sea
Our love, deeper than any ocean
Our love, for eternity.

And after all the rain will fall on us too
But I‚Äôll keep moving on proud and strong with you

Our love, is a bubbling fountain
Our love, that flows into a sea
Our love, deeper than any ocean
Our love, for eternity

Our love, our love, our love, our love

This specially designed white noise video soothes a colicky infant. After a few minutes, they will calm down and even fall asleep, giving both you and your child the rest you deserve. By imitating the sound of the womb, providing a comfortable atmosphere and by blocking out distracting noises, your fussy baby will settle down fast.

While playing white noise for babies, it‚Äôs important to keep tabs on the volume, because any white noise machine, smartphone, or computer can put out levels that are too loud for your child. It's recommended to play the sound at least a few feet from where your infant is sleeping and to keep the volume no louder than the sound of a soft shower.

Parents can download an app to turn their smartphone into a sound level meter. One good, free, option is the sound level meter app created by the U.S. National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) available on the app store as the NIOSH SLM app.

Letra:
Te escribo mensajes todas las noches pero los borro 
Pa quedar en visto, ese mal rato, mejor me lo ahorro  

Mi orgullo es tan grande y abajo me pesan 
No pienso humillarme pero igual quiero que sepas 

Deber√≠as estar aqu√≠ aqu√≠ donde te quiero
Pero al contrario est√°s all√° donde te extra√±o  
Quisiera pedirte que vuelvas que vuelvas 

Deber√≠as estar aqu√≠ aqu√≠ donde te quiero
Pero al contrario est√°s all√° donde te extra√±o  
Quisiera pedirte que vuelvas que vuelvas 

Para que a mi cuerpo, el alma le devuelvas

Letra: 
Tan f√°cil que es enamorarme
Y tan dif√≠cil olvidarte
Porque la vida me juraste
Y hoy te busco y t√∫ no est√°s
Aunque me duela ver tu foto
Entreno a mi coraz√≥n roto
Por si ma√±ana te vuelva a encontrar
Ya no s√© disimular
Llamo y no te puedo hablar
Tu recuerdo no se va
No se va, no se va
Algo en ti quiere volver
Y algo en m√≠ te va a encontrar
Tu recuerdo no se va
No se va, no se va
Qu√©date otra vez
Qu√©date toda la noche
Qu√©date otra vez
Qu√©date m√°s de las 12:00
Qu√©date otra vez
Que mi coraz√≥n no olvida
Amor as√≠ no se olvida, y no se va
No se va, no se va
Qu√©date otra vez
Qu√©date toda la vida
Qu√©date otra vez
T√∫ eres mi bala perdida
Qu√©date otra vez
Que mi coraz√≥n no olvida
Amor as√≠ no se olvida, y no se va
No se va, no se va
Grupo Frontera
Perder mis ojos cuando bailes
Sentir mil besos en el aire
Fue suficiente para convencerme
De que, si te vas
Te buscar√©, aunque suene loco
De Bogot√° hasta Buenos Aires
¬øC√≥mo te explico que no s√© olvidar?
Ya no s√© disimular
Llamo y no te puedo hablar
Tu recuerdo no se va
No se va, no se va
Algo en ti quiere volver
Y algo en m√≠ te va a encontrar
Tu recuerdo no se va
No se va, no se va
Qu√©date otra vez
Qu√©date toda la noche
Qu√©date otra vez
Qu√©date m√°s de las 12:00
Qu√©date otra vez
Que mi coraz√≥n no olvida
Amor as√≠ no se olvida, y no se va
No se va, no se va
Qu√©date otra vez
Qu√©date toda la vida
Qu√©date otra vez
T√∫ eres mi bala perdida

Hace tiempo que nos conocimos
Y pensamos en solo ser amigos
Si te digo la verdad, no era parte del plan
Pero tus ojos me dejaron enamorar

Y ahora muero por decir lo que siento por ti
Y tengo miedo, pues no quiero que te alejes de m√≠
Pero solo al pensar cu√°nto te quiero amar
Haciendo amigos, as√≠ no lo voy a alcanzar

Solo te pido
Que aunque no sientas lo mismo
No vayas a correr
Porque solo la Luna sabe
Lo mucho que no te quiero perder

Si estuvieras conmigo
Calmar√≠as mi pasi√≥n
Y por las noches te miro
Pero solo en mis sue√±os
Ya quisiera tenerte
Para abrazarte y quererte

Ya no quiero ser tu amigo
Quiero ser mucho m√°s
Quiero ser parte de tu vida
Te quiero enamorar

D√©jame ense√±arte
Lo mucho que voy a amarte
Solo d√©jame ser
De tu mundo, mujer

Solo te pido
Que aunque no sientas lo mismo
No vayas a correr
Porque solo la Luna sabe
Lo mucho que no te quiero perder

Si estuvieras conmigo
Calmar√≠as mi pasi√≥n
Por las noches te miro
Pero solo en mis sue√±os
Ya quisiera tenerte
Para abrazarte y quererte

Ya no quiero ser tu amigo
Quiero ser mucho m√°s
Quiero parte de tu vida
Te quiero enamorar

Lo mucho que voy a amarte

Todo era triste
No se como pude estar sin ti

Y yo no imaginaba

Memories follow me left and right 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now 

ever since the da day y-you went away
no I don't know how 
how to erase your body from out my brain 
whatcha gon do now
maybe I should just focus on me instead
But all I think about 
are the nights we were tangled up in your bed

oh no (oh no)
oh no (oh no)
you‚Äôre going round in circles got you stuck up in my head (yeah)

Memories follow me left and right 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
your love stays with me day and night 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now

ever since the da da day y-you went away 
someone tell me how 
how much more do I gotta drink for the pain 
whatcha gon do now
you did things to me that I just can't forget 
now all I think about 
are the nights we were tangled up in your bed 
oh no (oh no)
oh no (oh no)
you're going round in circles got ya stuck up in my head 

Memories follow me left and right 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
your love stays with me day and night 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now

did ya know you‚Äôre the one that got away
and even now baby i'm still not ok 
did ya know that my dreams they're are the same 
everytime I close my eyes 

Memories follow me left and right 
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now
your love stays with me day and night 
I can feel you over here i can feel you over here 
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now

I can feel you over here I can feel you over here
you take up every corner of my mind 
whatcha gon do now

[Intro]
Spit in my face, my love, it won't phase me
Spit in my face, my love, it won't change me
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone crazy
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone mad

[Chorus]
Spit in my face, my love, it won't phase me
Spit in my face, my love, it won't change me
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone crazy
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone mad

[Verse 1]
This is your fault
And I don't need you anyway
Stumble out the bathroom
Stumble out your arms again
She doing crank in the room with a noose and a Backwood
The bitch still call me crazy, lil' ho, how does that work?
She got the guest house jumpin' up with smoke out the attic
You're right, I know we love to argue, let's get at it
Wasted, sippin' on that liquor, you can taste it
Girl, don't touch that drink, I know you laced it
I don't know what to say except you're
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You crush my heart and say it's nothing
You broke me down, I kept on cutting
I bleed for you and now I'm gushing
I bleed for you, but you never cared

[Chorus]
Spit in my face, my love, it won't phase me
Spit in my face, my love, it won't change me
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone crazy
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone mad
Spit in my face, my love, it won't phase me
Spit in my face, my love, it won't change me
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone crazy
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone mad

Lyrics:
This drum gon‚Äô beat
But not for long 
I held my breath 
You held your tongue 
Flowers and Wreaths 
When it‚Äôs all done 
Never knowing 
Where I‚Äôm going 
b*** I keep it tucked!

X2

Fuck a sentimental b*** 
Where‚Äôs my motherfuckin g*n
You gave my cheques 
I gave you none 
Turn me on 
I faked a smile just like you wanted 
And if I‚Äôm never sober give a f*** bout what I do? 
And if she got a problem tell that h** to come and k*** me 
I‚Äôm d*** 

Out here 
Oh yeah 
Oh yeah 

This drum gon‚Äô beat
But not for long 
I held my breath 
You held your tongue 
Flowers and Wreaths 
When it‚Äôs all done 
Never knowing 
Where I‚Äôm going 
B*** I keep it tucked!

X2

B*** I keep it tucked 
B*** I keep it right here 
Liable to trip 
That‚Äôs jus my anxiety 
Whatever happens happens
Babe just know I did psychiatry 
So if I OD while I f*** you, that was my assignment 
She call me lovely 
I call it my money 
I wanna scream and burn it up until I fucking bleed
And if I‚Äôm never sober give a f*** bout what I do? 
And if she got a problem tell that h** to come and k*** me 
I‚Äôm d***

Out here 
Oh yeah 
Oh yeah 

This drum gon‚Äô beat
But not for long 
I held my breath 
You held your tongue 
Flowers and Wreaths 
When it‚Äôs all done 
Never knowing 
Where I‚Äôm going 
B*** I keep it tucked!

[Chorus]
Caroline 
I‚Äôll take you to my cemetery 
And I‚Äôll be fine 
I‚Äôll work it 
I‚Äôll work it 
Out
Count your days 
I‚Äôll roll myself my Mary Jane
Caroline 
I‚Äôll work it 
We‚Äôll work it out 

[Verse 1]
Listen now 
I pray for every beaten soul 
I‚Äôll waste 
Until I become flesh and bone 
Hear me out 
I‚Äôm one foot out the window pane 
I got a litre, a blunt and a cord to ease the weight 

Not falling into your grace
I Thought it all was good until I wrote my plans down
Never thought I‚Äôd feel heartbreak 
Until I looked at you 
And then you held your hands out 
Friends saying that I‚Äôm okay 
But if I‚Äôm okay I‚Äôm the same kid 
Who would‚Äôve thought that we‚Äôd be both fucking the same bitch

[Chorus]
Caroline 
I‚Äôll take you to my cemetery 
And I‚Äôll be fine 
I‚Äôll work it 
I‚Äôll work it 
Out
Count your days 
I‚Äôll roll myself my Mary Jane
Caroline 
I‚Äôll work it 
We‚Äôll work it out

[Verse 2]
Hey uhhh
Promise that when I‚Äôm gone 
I‚Äôll still connect the dots 
From hell I‚Äôll haunt you 
Goddamn
I‚Äôll take 
These words written in vain 
Cover them up in lace 
Diamonds and I‚Äôll 
Engrave 
Them 

[Chorus]
Not falling into your grace
Thought it all was good until I wrote my plans down
Never thought I‚Äôd feel heartbreak 
Until I looked at you 
And then you held your hands out 
Friends saying that I‚Äôm okay 
But if I‚Äôm okay I‚Äôm the same kid 
Who would‚Äôve thought that we‚Äôd be both fucking the same bitch

Caroline 
I‚Äôll take you to my cemetery 
And I‚Äôll be fine 
I‚Äôll work it 
I‚Äôll work it 
Out
Count your days 
I‚Äôll roll myself my Mary Jane
