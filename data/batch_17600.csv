Lyrics:
Stand for you
Fight for you I
Cry for you
Die for you I
Stand for you
Fight for you I

Well they don’t make them like you no more
Eyes like the ocean, you got me floored
A thousand lifetimes would be too short
Just wanna love you
You know I love you

But we take two steps forward and three steps back
I find excuses, you’re the one that shouts out the facts
I step forward and you step back
Woah, woah

See I’m sorry for the things that I’ve done
You’re the one thing that I always get wrong
I can’t say it to your face but I can say it in a song
See, I’m sorry for the things I’ve done

Stand for you
Fight for you I
Cry for you
Die for you I
Stand for you
Fight for you I

I left you flowers outside your door
That night you said you couldn’t take anymore
You told me that you’d heard it all before
Just let me love you
You know I love you

It’s always two steps forward and three steps back
I find excuses you’re the one that shouts out the facts
I step forward and you step back
Woah woah

See I’m sorry for the things that I’ve done
You’re the one thing that I always get wrong
I can’t say it to your face but can say it in a song
See, I’m sorry for the things I’ve done

Stand for you
Fight for you I
Cry for you
Die for you I
Stand for you
Fight for you I

Stand for you
Fight for you I
Cry for you
Die for you I
Stand for you
Fight for you I

There’s two sides to every story only one of them’s right
Let’s get down to the truth before we turn off the light
Instead of fighting one another need to fix this tonight
You know I love you
You know I love you

See I’m sorry for the things that I’ve done
You're the one thing that I always get wrong
I can’t say it to your face but can say it in a song
See, I’m sorry for the things that I’ve done

See I’m sorry for the things that I’ve done
You're the one thing that I always get wrong
I can’t say it to your face but can say it in a song
See, I’m sorry for the things that I’ve done

Lyrics

The birds have left the trees
The light pours onto me
I can feel you lying there all on your own

We got here the hard way
All those words that we exchange
Is it any wonder things get broke?

Cause in my heart and in my head
I never take back the things I said
So high above, I feel it coming down
She said, in my heart and in my head
Tell me why this has to end
Oh, no, oh, no

I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
We built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
We built it up to pull it down

Now all the birds have fled
The hurt just leaves me scared
Losing everything I've ever known

It's all become too much
Maybe I'm not built for love
If I knew that I could reach you, I would go

It's in my heart and in my head
You can't take back the things you said
So high above, I feel it coming down
She said, in my heart and in my head
Tell me why this has to end
Oh, no, oh, no

I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
We built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
We built it up to pull it down

And we build it up and we build it up
Yeah we build it up to pull it down
And we build it up and we build it up

ROÇA EM MIM
(Suheldo Oliveira, Breno Lima Carvalho, Patrick Rego,  Mateus Félix e Luan Pereira)

Coloca o capacete que lá vem pedrada
E pra você não esquecer
É mais uma do LP

Elas gostam da minha voz no ouvido
De sentir o meu cheiro, do love bandido
Elas gostam de sentar no perigo
Se envolve sem medo, sem pensar no risco

Diz se apaixonar no cowboy
Vai com calma bebê, depois do pré tem o pós
Sabe que nós faz bem gostosim
Eu chamei ela pra roça e ela me pediu assim

Roca Roça em Mim
Roça Roca em Mim
Tira o chapéu e a bota e me bota gostosim

Roca Roça em Mim
Roça Roca em Mim
Que hoje tu vira o olho galopando gostosim 

Roca Roça em Mim
Roça Roca em Mim
Tiro o chapéu e a bota e te boto gostosim

REVOADA NO COLCHÃO

(Shylton Fernandes , Lucas Medeiros , Diego barão , djdg e Batidao Stronda)

Vai, vai achando que não vai doer
Que vai ser molezinha esquecer
Se prepara que tu vai sofrer

Quando a balada acabar
Quando o teu porre passar
Quando a ressaca de saudade implorar por mim
Só não esquece que eu te avisei que ia ser assim

Tu pode me evitar, pode me bloquear
Mas não vai conseguir me deletar do coração
Tu pode até beijar, mas depois vai ligar
Querendo aquela nossa revoada no colchão
Fazendo dom dom dom dom dom dom

Ah meu coração se apaixonou 
Por alguém que só me usou
E eu pensando que era amor 
Mas ela só queria curtição
Volta mozão que eu tô viciado

Que amorzinho safado

LETRA:

Eu não vou me envolver
Tem cara de quem vai me sofrer
Não, não vou me envolver
Você é só rolê

Mas pensa num rolê que beija bem
E faz gostoso
Não que eu me apeguei
Mas já to querendo de novo
Só mais uma vez
Aí papai… me apaixonei

Refrão
Esse seu beijo vagabundo
Carinha de quem não vale nada

Senta Danada
Shylton Fernandes / Victor Casagrande / Robson Lima / Kinho Chefão
Producao Musical : Newton Fonseca

Tô com saudade
De beijar você toda
E fazer um amor nível hard
Eu tô com saudade
Eu aposto você também tá

Conheço de longe esse olhar
Mas eu não me importo em dizer
O desejo que eu tô de você

O meu colinho, quer tua sentada
Então senta danada
O meu colinho, quer tua sentada
Então senta danada
Senta danada

50 CÓPIAS 
(Gustavo Henrique, Denner Ferrari, Jimmi Luzzo)

Tô entrando em desespero
Em todo canto eu te vejo
Deve ter umas 50 cópias de você 
Espalhadas por essa cidade

Beijando na boca da mesma pessoa 
Se esfregando na minha frente isso é maldade
Mas é melhor assim do que não te topar
Porque quando cê some eu sei que ele tá 

Fazendo amor com meu amor
Tirando a roupa que eu tirava
Fazendo amor com meu amor
Passando a mão onde eu passava 
Ele te mata de prazer
E me mata de raiva

One of my favorite subjects to harp on is becoming a middle aged rap fan while staying open minded and excited about the evolution of the art. Last week I was at a $uicideboy$ show, feeling extra old, when I saw Ghostemane come out and kill a quick guest appearance during an opening dj set. I’m only surface level familiar with the burgeoning scene / sub-genre of aggressively dark underground rap I would compartmentalize him in. It’s amazing to see this younger generation of underground rappers make their audience go berserk. The shows feel more like hardcore or metal performances than a rap show in a traditional sense. Wanted to talk to the new Los Angeles transplant about this scene, and how he got involved in it. Hear us talk about how the prescription opioid epidemic affected his family, moving to LA 3 weeks ago, and why most young goths have it all wrong about satan.

Remember kids: sharing is caring.

Lyrics:
Mann Bharryaa 2.0

Ve methon tera mann bhareya
Mann bhareya badal gaya saara
Ve tu mainu chad jaana
Gallan teriyan ton lagda hai yaara
Ve methon tera mann bhareya

Mann bhareya badal gaya saara
Ve tu mainu chad jaana
Gallan teriyan ton lagda hai yaara
Gal gal te shaq kardein
Aitbaar zara vi nai
Hun teriyan akhiyaanch
Mere layi pyaar zara vi nai

Mera te koi hai ni tere bin
Tenu mil jana kise da sahara
Ve tu mainu chad jaana
Gallan teriyan ton lagda hai yaara

Kash aisa ho sakda
Rabb de paeri pe jandi
Teri jagah te jaani
Maut mainu le jandi
Jo tu na mila manenge
Woh dehleez nahin hoti
Rabb naam ki yaara
Yahan koi cheez nahin hoti
Ho rabb ohnu kho lendae
Jeda hove uhnu jaan ton pyaara
Ve tu mainu chad jaana
Gallan teriyan ton lagda hai yaara

Tu sabb janda aen
Main chad ni sakdi tenu
Taan hi taan unglan te
Roz nachaunae mainu

Tu sabb janda aen
Main chad ni sakdi tenu
Teri yaad ne unglan te
Roz nachaunae mainu

Agle janam vich allah
Aisa khel racha ke bheje
Mainu tu bana ke bheje
Tainu main bana ke bheje

Hai eko hondi ae ve zindagi
Tu milna ni mainu ve dobara
Ve tu mainu chad jaana
Gallan teriyan ton lagda hai yaara
Ve methon tera mann bhareya

The pain of a selfless yet incomplete love story continues with ‘Filhaal 2 - Mohabbat’,
a romantic ballad  that reinstates the fact, true love never dies and if it does, it was never meant to be. 

The beloved pair of Akshay Kumar and Nupur Sanon return as Dr. Kabir Malhotra and Mehar Grewal respectively, alongside Ammy Virk in a captivating film directed by Arvindr Khaira. Like always, B Praak delivers heart-melting vocals penned down by ace lyricist Jaani. 

Desi Melodies teamed up with Cape of Good Films and Azeem Dayani to create history one more time after making ‘Filhall’.

LETRA:

O Dia Está Lindo,
Clima Ensolarado 
Clima De Piscina Cervejinha E Churrasco
Familia É Intocavél 
Fé Inabalavel 
Peço Ao Meus Deus Que Proteja Meus Aliados 

Pois É 
Essa Vida É Muito Louca Né 
E Eu Ja Fui Sei Bem Como É 
São Varios Mandadão Que Testa Nossa Fé ,
Mais Se Estiver Mandado 
Volta De Ré 

Whisky Laterna Verde 
Pra Nós Embrazar
Chama Essas Danadas Que Estão Doida Pra Sentar 
Uh Lalá
Patricinha Vem Da Pista Pra Sarrar 
No Ak , Vida De Artista Todas 
Elas Quer Me Dar

 É O Poze Do Rodo Lacoste No Peito 
Sempre Posturado
Com O Bolso Cheio De Dinheiro
Posso Fazer Nada 
Vivo A Vida Desse Jeito

Arrasta Pra Cima 
Que Eu Vou Te Contar O Segredo

É
Essa Vida É Muito Louca Né 
E Eu Ja Fui Sei Bem Como É 
São Varios Mandadão Que Testa Nossa Fé ,
Mais Se Estiver Mandado 
Volta De Ré 

É O Poze Do Rodo 
Lacoste No Peito 
Sempre Posturado
Com O Bolso Cheio De Dinheiro 
Posso Fazer Nada 
Vivo A Vida Desse Jeit
 Arrasta Pra Cima Que Eu Vou Te Contar O Segredo

Passando Na Blitz 
Eles Mandam Eu Encostar 
Fala Que Eu Sou Ganso 
Mas Nunca Arruma Nada 
To Na Pista Na Infra 
É Brabão Pra Me Pegar
Passando A Mil Eu Do Fuga Até No Radar.

Eu Sei Bem Que Essas Danadas Quer Me Dar 
Então Pode Sentar 
Então Pode Sentar
Eu Sei Bem Que Essas Danadas Quer Me Dar
Então Pode Sentar 
Então Pode Sentar

Essa Vida É Muito Louca Né
E Eu Ja Fui Sei Bem Como É 
São Varios Mandadão Que Testa Nossa Fé ,
Mais Se Estiver Mandado Volta De Ré 
É O Poze Do Rodo

LETRA
Mas se quiser me olhar como um quadro sem explicação
Tô de um jato lunar, na capital de São Sebastião

Que o sol da manhã te dissolva, seu vampiro de filmes pastelão
Mas quem vai nos julgar?!
Sou seu despenteado leão

Sei que cê me entende bem, sempre foge quando namora
Se você não ama ninguém, porque tá me escutando agora?

Sua linda tão louca, minha Monalisa tira a minha roupa
Me fascina nessa sina, me beija na boca, minha mulher menina, me ensina ser vida louca,
Teu olho piscina, me afoga e faz boca a boca
Renova minha rima, vem de garfo que hoje é sopa
Menina...

Mas se quiser ficar, eu desfaço e agarro sua mão
Vilão particular, sou um blefe de um filme de ação

Se eu subo nesse palco aqui
Foi Deus que me criou assim

E os holofotes vem ao meu encontro, é que eu te amo e nem te conto
Não, não posso ser seu santo...

Sou fato ou hipótese...
Sou rei, cigano ou nômade...

Desculpe esse meu jeito soberano, mas hoje é por você que eu canto,
É por você que eu canto...

Sei que cê me quer também, Marília leoa gostosa, posso te ligar meu bem?!
Que que cê tá fazendo agora?!
Tão lindo, tão louco meu grande amigo, depois de você os outros são outros
Cê, tá fodido, vamos fazer amor cantar
O sertanejo antigo, me beija na boca amor
Pode ser até que você não me dê moral
Até me ver no espaço pela banca de jornal

Mas se quiser me olhar como um quadro sem explicação

[LETRA]
Touch me like the words fly in your head
Touch me like you never touch before
Feel my body in the arms of perfection
let's do, your imagination
Say my name, if I wanna play
I don't need permission
Make me your decision
Say my name, if I wanna play
I don't need permission
Make me your decision

Say my name, say my name no controle você sabe quem
De moto na Brasil fazendo o game
Fazendo merda aqui ouvindo Kayne
Um maço de cigarro eu vou pra júpiter Dayanne
O Rio de janeiro não é Miami
A vida não tá fácil né Raiane, gemidos e barulhos de sirene

Me sinto como um pássaro, não esquenta a cabeça Sr. Palito de Fósforo
Seu raciocínio é mágico
Seu rapper não é lógico
Preciso de um lema e de algum antibiótico
Me sinto como um ácaro
Passeio no tapete do Aladdin por todo sábado
Sério, pô, ontem foi o meu aniversário
Apertei algum do cemitério…

Me enganei, seu jogo é difícil, quatro ases e um orgulho bobo pra nós dois
Eu te enganei, meu jogo é difícil, quatro estações e um bom motivo pra nós dois

Não me leve a mal mas eu não minto, sempre tô blefando por nós dois
Se eu vacilei foi por instinto
Deixa o fim do mundo pra depois
Não te quero tanto, mas te sinto, não me confunda tanto assim
Me desculpe mas não jogo limpo, não arranque palavras de mim

Solidão de Hamlet, ainda tenho uma carta na manga tipo Gambit
Viemos lá de Bangu City
Sem papo de Rambo e jungle eu posso te mostrar o quanto eu te amo
Se tudo der certo ainda te lambo, posso te ensinar a dançar mambo
Acendemos um mango haze
Qual foi a última coisa que tu fez pela primeira vez
Tipo nudes, ficções, falso amor, facções, afters, ratões
Toda noite meu amor eu peço que você me mude em frações,
amor e noções actors, ações
Toda noite amor eu peço pra que você me mande
Nudes, ficções, falso amor e frações, afters
Toda noite amor eu peço que você me mude
Toda noite amor eu peço que me mande nudes",True,True,33854443.0,Not Found

Lyrics:

That’s my bestfriend she a real bad bitch
Got her own money she don’t need nig
On the dance floor she had two three drinks
Now she twerking she throw it out and come back in

That’s my bestfriend she a real bad bitch
Drive her own car she don’t need no lyft
In the strip club know my girl gone tip
Now she twerking throw it out and come back in

Beep beep is that my bestie in a tesi
Fresh blow out skin on 10 owe she ready
Bitch you look goodt with a t at the end
Imma hype her every time that’s my mothafuckin friend
She been down since the jellies and the bo bo’s
Now we steppin out the G in manolo’s
When we pull up to scene hoes be filled with jealousy
If a bitch get finicky she gone bring that energy
I hit her phone with the tea like bitch guess what
All the rich ass boys wanna fuck on us
All this ass sittin up you can look don’t touch
And I’m bad bussin bands every time we link up

That’s my bestfriend she a real bad bitch
Got her own money she don’t need nig
On the dance floor she had two three drinks
Now she twerking she throw it out and come back in

That’s my bestfriend she a real bad bitch
Drive her own car she don’t need no lyft
In the strip club know my girl gone tip
Now she twerking throw it out and come back in

That’s my bestfriend if you need a freak
I aint dumb but mothafucka she my Tweedle D
If she ride for me she don’t need a key
If you sideways she’ll straighten you as needed be
And she so bad that I just can’t take that bitch nowhere
She off her fifth shot I said uh uh don’t go there
Bitch break her back she protect and attack
Get that strap let them buckle
Foot on neck give no air
Whole world wanna be us
My main bitch she my day 1
On my way bitch letcha get drunk
Celebrate cause we the baddest in the club

That’s my bestfriend she a real bad bitch
Got her own money she don’t need nig
On the dance floor she had two three drinks
Now she twerking she throw it out and come back in

That’s my bestfriend she a real bad bitch
Drive her own car she don’t need no lyft
In the strip club, know my girl gone tip
Now she twerking throw it out and come back in

Bust down wrist, not a bust down bitch (Ah)
Said I want your man, no the fuck I don't, sis (Uh, uh)
If he a rich nigga, why he still hitting licks? (Licks)
Nigga spending bread but he still can't hit
Bitch please (Bitch), Lamborghini keys
Pussy dripping ice, he get flown out to me
Bitch please, I want a man with the Bs (Yeah)
Pussy from the Bay, goin' dumb on the D (Hahaha)

Hair ain't nothin' with a inch (Hahaha)
Do it on his face with a thizz (Ugh)

Run it up (Uh), print it up, big bucks (Ayy, ayy)
Try your luck (Uh), none of my bitches been touched

Hennessy on my lips, take a little sip
Privacy on the door, I'ma make the shit grip

Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type

Lyrics:
Can’t stop, won’t stop, get guap
Ten white toes in them Tory flip-flops
Manicures and pedicures, I’m always tip-top
When they say I’m not hot, all these lies need to stop
'Cause I’m icy, wifey, haters wanna fight me
Never been the one get RIP up on a white tee
Keep my hands clean, got some hittas moving sheisty
Ask me if I’m rollin’ with some Gucci, bitch I might be
It’s very unlikely my wrist ain’t looking icy
Charging by the minute 'cause my time is very pricey
Yeah, I be where the bosses be
Judging from my vibe, you can feel it in my energy
Stacking paper steadily so I can live in luxury
Looking in the mirror, I thank God for what I’m about to be
You beefing with my enemy does not make you a friend of me
Girls so weird, stay clear, I’m living drama free
Never living comfortably, got a lot of goals to meet
My team is trying to eat so we grinding 'til our mental bleed
You tryna get a bag of weed? I’m tryna get a bag a week
Put it in my savings and invest in the right companies
My dream is like a child and I’m taking all the custody
Obstacles be slowing me, but that buffer molded me
So I take my time, 'cause I’m always where I’m suppose to be
Keep my niggas close to me 'cause I’m knowing they go for me
You can not get a hold of me? I’m probably in a solo meet
Always making moves, man that’s how I keep my sanity
Yeah, it’s my team's summer
Couple setbacks, bounce back and recover
The clique real small but we making big moves
And we headed to the top so we can get a better view like
I'ma catch a tan overseas while I’m out the country
Let me get some Hennessy while I’m chilling on the beach
I'ma count a couple G’s, let the server bring receipts
Double checking my expenses, never messy, always neat
Never ever, thats how a hot girl do it
Number one stunner, icy girl with a Cuban
Cash money, mama that be dining in Bahamas
Eating Fettucini pasta with the scallops and the lobsters
Huh, I don’t got no time for these hoes
Speaking on my name like I’m someone that they know
I’m the big cat bitch, yes these niggas love me
Is that Gucci on my feet? Shit, bitch it might be

Lyrics:
Pull up in my hood best dressed
Next thing, upgrade, who's next?
Rich boy got him on deck
Good boy, tell that nigga fetch
I put my new man on a leash
Traded in my old nigga, he was just a lease
I ride around town 'til I leave
I gave the boy a round spit him back to the streets
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da
Yeah, I spit him back to the streets
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da
Back to the streets

These dudes don’t owe you a thing
These hoes do it all for a ring
What you thinking?
What’s good?
Fuck how you feeling I wish a nigga would
Had to hit the heisman on ya homies
Stepping in here bad bitches only
My ex used to act like he owned me
Ain’t enough just to treat me like a trophy
I had that passed that knew I had trash that
Bounced on his ass turn that boy into flashback
I’m a fivestar bitch with a price tag
Got to find me somebody that can match that

Last one got on my last nerves
Made me go change my passwords
I hit the curve with that swerve
You know I get the last word

Pull up in my hood best dressed
Next thing, upgrade, who's next?
Rich boy got him on deck
Good boy, tell that nigga fetch
I put my new man on a leash
Traded in my old nigga, he was just a lease
I ride around town 'til I leave
I gave the boy a round spit him back to the streets
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da
Yeah, I spit him back to the streets
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da
Back to the streets

Back to the streets
send you back to your old hood
on hood baby this is for your own good
I'm a player ass bitch and you knew it
had a good time
now I'm ready for some new dick

Pass it to Saweetie now u hit it
through with it
There ain’t really
Nothin else to do with it
yea
You know i leveled up
I can't be stuck
I wish you luck thoooo

Consider yourself blessed
you got to fuck with the baddest
you know that I can't be kept
no I gotta dip out

Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
Bad bitch, I'ma ride the dick all night
Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
That's my type, nigga, that's my type

[Verse 3: Yung Miami]
Hop out the foreign car swingin' my inches (Yup)
All these C's on me like I'm Crippin' (Bitch)
All this ice on me, bitch, I'm drippin'
Never been a quick fuck, more so a ticket (Miami)
I go viral when I talk, period
Bitch, I'm a boss
Watch look small but it cost
I ain't never been bougie
Pull up in the hood, it's a movie
Tights all up in my coochie
[Pre-Chorus: Saweetie]
Hennessy on my lips, take a lil' sip
Privacy on the door, I'ma make the shit grip

[Chorus: Saweetie]
Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
Bad bitch, I'ma ride the dick all night
Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
That's my type, nigga, that's my type

Lyrics:
Hello, nothing whats up 
Look at twitter for what? 
What the fuck? 
These fucking big mouth ass blogs 
Big mouth ass n***as, shut the fuck up 


Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (shhhh) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin 
Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (that’s right) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin (don’t you say a thing) 

Imma put this pussy in his mouf (in his mouf) 
Imma put this pussy in his mouf 
Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (that’s right) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin 

(Verse 1) 
Why niggas always speakin on who I’m fuckin on 
He must’ve got excited when I FaceTimed with nothin on 
Them same lips that’s yappin be the same ones I nutted on 
Hunnid k (please) you know how much paper I be touching on 
That’s light 
Betta check my net worth 
Post a pic in his sweatshirt 
I bet it have my ex hurt 
That’s what I get for kissin on these frogs 
He got mad and told my business to the blogs 
Nigga pause 
I’m appalled 
Need to chill out 
Yeah I pulled up 
Then I bust then I peel out 
Said he was a boss but he Talkin like a groupie 
I knew he wasn’t ready for this pretty bitch coochie 

Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (shhhh) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin 
Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (that’s right) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin (don’t you say a thing) 
Imma put this pussy in his mouf (in his mouf) 
Imma put this pussy in his mouf 
Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (that’s right) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin 

(Bridge) 
Don’t make me refund the dick 
Send his ass back cause he came to quick 
That shit wasn’t bussin 
I knew I shouldn’t have fucked him 
Something told me not to trust this nigga 
Now my business in the streets I should punch this nigga 
That shit wasn’t bussin 
I knew I should’ve fucked him 

(Verse2) 
But His vibe had me so moist 
Told him I wanna fuck him in his rolls Royce 
Sent over a car I had no choice 
Got to his estate and them gates opened up 
Licked around my waist and my legs opened up 
Can’t lie I was stuck For second 
He was givin me that pressure 
Like this nigga might be special 
He was doin all the extras 
I was lovin how he thuggin 
Yea he Pumpin and he pumpin 
Aww shit this nigga cumin 
Yikes 


CHORUS 
Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (shhhh) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin 
Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (that’s right) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin (don’t you say a thing) 
Imma put this pussy in his mouf (in his mouf) 
Imma put this pussy in his mouf 
Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (that’s right) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin

Lyrics:
Let me tell you bout this chick 
Im from the west coast 
Light skin baby hairs, 
I heard I do the most 
I swear Im so saditty 
I cant be approached 
If that bitch hella basic, 
Then that bitch gotta go 
Huh, whats that in my cup? 
That’s that potion 
Rubbin 100s on my skin like its lotion 
Sitting courtside with my my loc and 
presidential rollie on me like I’m voting 
smelling like a rich bitch im too potent 
I don’t do the nose bleeds 
I want floor seats 
Im only fuckin with a nigga 
That can coach me 
I wasn’t raised by IG but the OGs 
If you miss the old me then you aint know me bitch 
The baccarat too trendy so im off it 
I hit the club and get some 1’s and then I toss it 
See every problem for my family 
I done solved it 
The pretty girls gon here this shit and start a moshpit 

Boss shit know you need a boss chick 
Real niggas gon pay what it cost quick (make it quick) 
Long nails only get the tall tips 
That aint MAC girl that’s icy on my lips (x2) 

I aint going no where just embrace me bitch 
Always lurkin on my page you don’t hate me sis 
I aint botherin nobody I just breathe and shit 
Deep down in your heart you wanna be like this 

No hoe, we don’t give a fuck about those like I’m D Lo 
Pretty filipino from the bay like I’m P Lo 
We know 
Yo pockets aint bigger than yo ego 
I need a rich nigga like dinero in casino 

Boss shit know you need a boss chick 
Real niggas gon pay what it cost quick (make it quick) 
Long nails only get the tall tips 
That aint MAC girl that’s icy on my lips (x2) 

 
(Bridge Out) 
510 stay down ten white toes 
Pretty hoes pull up to my show 
916 always poppin shit 
Getting thick, pretty bitch get rich

Lyrics:

Yeah, I doubt, I doubt myself
And I'm too proud to ask for help
When you see me beside myself
I don't have to explain it, baby
Yeah, I'm over picking fights
And trying to mend it with the high
Don't wanna know that I'm not right
I know that I've been lately, lately

Yeah, sometimes I need someone to pick me up
Overdose my mind with the things I love
You can take me there
When my heart beats, when my heart beats free

Take my hand in the middle of a crisis
Pull me close, show me, baby, where the light is
I was scared of a heart I couldn't silence
But you make me, you make me feel good, I like it

Take my hand in the middle of a crisis
Pull me close, show me, baby, where the light is
I was scared of a heart I couldn't silence
But you make me, you make me feel good, I like it

But you make me, you make me feel good

Yeah, I get over-overwhelmed
When all these problems burn like hell
Maybe I just need a friend
Who never calls me crazy, crazy

You pull me off the front line before I run
Keep me cool, but not get overdone
You can take me there
When my heart speaks, when my heart speaks free

Take my hand in the middle of a crisis
Pull me close, show me, baby, where the light is
I was scared of a heart I couldn't silence
But you make me, you make me feel good, I like it

Take my hand in the middle of a crisis
Pull me close, show me, baby, where the light is
I was scared of a heart I couldn't silence
But you make me, you make me feel good, I like it

But you make me, you make me feel good, I like it, I like it
You make me, you make me feel good

Taking the weights off
To help with the pressure
And I was here stressing
Thinking it mattered
Been with you for hours, but it feels like seconds
It's only moments and I'm in heaven
It's only moments and I'm in heaven, oh

You make me feel good
You make me feel good
You make me, you make me feel good, I like it

Take my hand in the middle of a crisis
Pull me close, show me, baby, where the light is
I was scared of a heart I couldn't silence
But you make me, you make me feel good, I like it

Na-na-na-na-na-na, oh
Na-na-na-na-na-na

Lyrics:

I hope that you finally found it all
All the things that you said that you needed after all
All those times we had, they left a mark
And I know life goes on but I miss you in the dark
Based on two years time
Two stories we tell about
All of the good times and times that were hell
When we were young
We were broke
We were chasing a fire and watching it turn to smoke
And some of us just let go
You got lost
Had enough
Time it did what it does and turned what you had to rust
But wherever you are, understand me
You were loved
You were loved
I hope that our paths, they cross again
Cause I’m dying to know all the places you have been
Some day when the future meets the past
That’s when we’ll make up for all of the years that went so fast
Cause days became years became stories we tell
That I know you can’t deal but here’s wishing you well
We were young
We were broke
We were chasing a fire that suddenly turned to smoke
And some of us had to let go, yeah
You got lost, had enough
Time it did what it does and turned what we had to rust
But wherever you are you should know
You were loved
You were loved
You were loved
Loved
You were loved

Lyrics:

Don't lie, I know you've been thinking it
And two times, you let it slip from your lips
You've got too much pride to make any promises
Thinking that we got time, and you want to keep it in

I want you out in the pouring rain
I want you down on your knees
Prayin' to God that I feel the same
I'm right here, baby, so please

Hold me up, tie me down
'Cause I never wanna leave your side
Swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive
You can take me home
You can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up

And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me down, down

Nine lives until you fall at my feet
Don't hide, you're wasting your energy
You're not shy, so baby, it's useless
So don't try, 'cause you'll end up losin' it

I want you out in the pouring rain
I want you down on your knees
Prayin' to God that I feel the same
I'm right here, baby, so please

Hold me up, tie me down
'Cause I never wanna leave your side
Swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive
You can take me home
You can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up

And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me down, down

So wrap your arms around my chest
And I'll put my hands around your neck
'Cause nobody wins these waiting games
You push and you pull, but you should stay
Stay

Hold me up, tie me down
'Cause I never wanna leave your side
Swear to never let you down (never let you down)
And it's been eatin' me alive (oh)
You can take me home
You can never let me go (never let me go)
Hold me up, hold me up

And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me down, down
Down, down

Lyrics: 
 
All the nights I was drowning in the rain
Hold my breath, tell myself I would see you again
Let the storm blow over for better days
 
Looking back, never knew what I left behind
Find it hard the view changes all the time
I was always yours and you were always mine
 
Cause I needed space, my heart to break
Cause giving you up was my greatest mistake
 
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn’t live without it
I hate I couldn't hold you up
When we were in the waters drowning
Now I painted over our mistakes
Just trying to find my way back to you
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn’t live without it
To know I couldn’t live without it
 
I see your face in the moment I feel lost
Cause I lost my way and I feel the fault
All I’m wanna say is I'm sorry
Woah
 
I just needed space, my heart to break
Cause giving you up was my greatest mistake
 
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn’t live without it
I hate I couldn't hold you up
When we were in the waters drowning
Now I painted over our mistakes
Just trying to find my way back to you
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn’t live without it
To know I couldn’t live without it
Woah
It's like the world stands still
Without your love
Nothing's real
 
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn’t live without it
I hate I couldn't hold you up
When we were in the waters drowning
Now I painted over our mistakes
Just trying to find my way back to you
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn’t live without it
 
Woah 
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn’t live without it
Woah
It's like the world stands still
Without your love
Nothing's real

“Caught Up (with Olivia O’Brien)” Lyrics:
 
I’ve been thinking
That I want you
Cause I’m caught up in everything little thing you do
 
Am I dreaming?
Yeah I wonder
Cause I’m caught up
 
I’ve been missing you all night long
I don’t even know why
Listening to my favorite song
I got you on my mind
 
See your face everywhere I go
And I don’t even try, no
I don’t even try
Don’t even try
 
It goes on and on and on and on
Is it so wrong?
I hate the sound of moving on
Look what you do
Look what you do to me, yeah
I got you on repeat, so
 
I’ve been thinking
That I want you
Cause I’m caught up in everything little thing you do
Am I dreaming?
Yeah I wonder
Cause I’m caught up in every little thing you do
 
You got more than a piece of me
You could have the whole thing
Think I’m stuck in my favorite dream
Wake me up in fifteen
 
I’m obsessing and it’s no good
But I don’t even mind, no
I don’t even mind
 
It goes on and on and on and on
Is it so wrong?
I hate the sound of moving on
Look what you do
Look what you do to me, yeah
I got you on repeat, so
 
I’ve been thinking
That I want you
Cause I’m caught up in everything little thing you do
 
Am I dreaming?
Yeah I wonder?
Cause I’m caught up in every little thing you do
 
Every little thing you do

Lyrics:

Who cares what the world′s gonna say?
'Cause you know they′re gonna say it anyway
Who cares if they laugh at what we do?

'Cause it's only me and you that know the truth

Middle finger to the sky
They don′t know ′bout you and I
We've been rollin′ deeper than they'll ever know
Even though I broke your heart
No, that won′t keep us apart
Baby, I know, I know, I'm not giving you up

If you want my lovin′ you got it, anytime you want it
Baby, bring your body back to me
They can call me foolish and stupid
Don't know why I do this
But, baby, bring your body back to me
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
I know, I know, I′m not giving you up
If you want my lovin′ you got it, anytime you want it
Baby, bring your body back to me

Who cares what the world's gonna think?
′Cause you know they're gonna think it anyway
I love all the bad things that we do
So shut your mouth and put your hands where I want you to

Middle finger to the sky
They don′t know 'bout you and I
We′ve been rollin' deeper than they'll ever know
Even though I broke your heart
No, that won′t keep us apart
Baby, I know, I know, I′m not giving you up

If you want my lovin' you got it, anytime you want it
Baby, bring your body back to me
They can call me foolish and stupid
Don′t know why I do this
But, baby, bring your body back to me
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
I know, I know, I′m not giving you up
If you want my lovin' you got it, anytime you want it
Baby, bring your body
Bring your body back to me

Ooh, body back to me
Ooh, baby, bring your body

If you want my lovin′ you got it, anytime you want it
Baby, bring your body back to me
They can call me foolish, stupid
Don't know why I do this
Oh, baby, ooh
Bring your body back to me
Bring your body back to me
Baby, bring your body back to me

Lyrics:
Been following signs on the road
Pretendin’ to know where to go
Now we’re bending and breaking the mold
Searching for hope, out on our own

Don’t know what comes next
Haven’t been there yet
But we feel the weight on our shoulders
It’s a wild ride
Only got one life
And we’ll take on whatever it throws us

Always living on the run
Never setting with the sun
Our hearts have broken and they’ve loved
But we’re still young
And the best is yet to come

Always living on the run
Never setting with the sun
Our hearts have broken and they’ve loved
But we’re still young
And the best is yet to come

Living our life to the full
Chasing our dreams as we go
When it’s taking a toll we will hold on
Searching for hope, out on our own

Don’t know what comes next
Haven’t been there yet
But we feel the weight on our shoulders
It’s a wild ride
Only got one life
And we’ll take on whatever it throws us

Always living on the run
Never setting with the sun
Our hearts have broken and they’ve loved
But we’re still young
And the best is yet to come

Always living on the run
Never setting with the sun
Our hearts have broken and they’ve loved
But we’re still young
And the best is yet to come

Lyrics:
You the wave upon my ocean  
pounding rhythm and motion
its full moon kinda night yeah 
I don’t wanna go home yet

You can question my devotion
Wear my heart on my shoulder
just relax and let the riptide pull you close

ahh
Baby all i want to do is coast
with you
energy the body flows
ahhh
baby all i want to do is coast 
with you 
Frequency of all we know

Feelin like I caught a wave with ya
I been dealin with a lot of changes 
And all the people that I like to hang with 
They all been sayin that I ain’t the same
Listen, I been chillin with you for a couple days 
If you ain’t afraid me and you should rage in the sun rays
Come on out the cage don’t wanna tame
Live it your way
Body go for days
Got me in a daze 
Parties in LA feel like holidays 
Hit the PCH
And we on our way to a place I was born and raised 
You live on the screen and the stage
I wanna fit in between your legs 
Let’s pick a day 
Everything can wait 
Words can’t relay but it’s giving… fate

Baby all i want to do is coast
with you
energy the body flows
ahhh
baby all i want to do is coast 
with you 
Frequency of all we know

nothing feels as real when we’re connected
so relax and let the riptide pull you close
ahhh
baby all i want to do is coast 
with you 
Frequency of all we know

the stars come down
ya drown them out
I’m sinking deeper into you
i breath you in 
i breathe you out 
im sinking deeper into  

ahh
Baby all i want to do is coast
with you
energy the body flows
ahhh
baby all i want to do is coast 
with you 
Frequency of all we know

nothing feels as real when we’re connected
so relax and let the riptide pull you close
ahhh
baby all i want to do is coast 
with you 
Frequency of all we know

Most Girls Lyrics
Some girls, feel best in their tiny dresses
Some girls, nothin' but sweatpants, looking like a princess
Some girls, kiss new lips every single night
They're stayin' out late cause they just celebrating life

You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in
'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen
We're all just playing a game in a way, trying to win at life

Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
Most girls, work hard, go far, we are unstoppable
Most girls, our fight to make every day, no two are the same
I wanna be like, I wanna be like, most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like, most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like

They're stayin' out late cause they just celebratin'
I wanna be like, I wanna be like
They're stayin' out late cause they just celebratin'
I wanna be like, I wanna be like

Some girls, like to keep their physique real private
Some girls, wear jeans so tight, 'cause it feels so right, yeah
Some girls, every day searching, keep the page turning
Sleepin' in late cause they just celebrating life

You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in
'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen
We're all just playing a game in a way, trying to win at life

Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
Most girls, work hard, go far, we are unstoppable
Most girls, our fight to make every day, no two are the same
I wanna be like, I wanna be like, most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like, most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like

They're stayin' out late cause they just celebratin'
I wanna be like, I wanna be like

Most girls, (yeah)
Most girls, (wanna be, wanna be, wanna be)
Most girls, our fight to make every day, no two are the same
I wanna be like...

Most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like, most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like
They're stayin' out late cause they just celebratin'
I wanna be like, I wanna be like
They're stayin' out late cause they just celebratin'
I wanna be like
They're stayin' out late cause they just celebratin' life

►""Wrong Direction"" Lyrics:

I don't hate you
No, I couldn't if I wanted to
I just hate all the hurt that you put me through
And that I blame myself for letting you
Did you know I already knew?

Couldn't even see you through the smoke
Lookin' back, I probably should have known
But I just wanted to believe that you were out sleepin' alone

Loved me with your worst intentions
Didn't even stop to question
Every time you burned me down
Don't know how; for a moment it felt like heaven 
Loved me with your worst intentions
Painted us a happy ending
Every time you burned me down
Don't know how; for a moment it felt like heaven

And it's so gut-wrenchin'
Fallin' in the wrong direction

On my tip-toes
But I still couldn't reach your ego
Guess I was crazy to give you my body, my mind
Don't know what I was thinkin' 'til now
Everyone thinks that you're somebody else
You even convinced yourself

Couldn't even see you through the smoke
Lookin' back, I probably should have known
But I just wanted to believe that you were out sleepin' alone

Loved me with your worst intentions
Didn't even stop to question
Every time you burned me down
Don't know how; for a moment it felt like heaven
Loved me with your worst intentions
Painted us a happy ending
Every time you burned me down
Don't know how; for a moment it felt like heaven

And it's so gut-wrenchin' (Ooh, ooh)
Fallin' in the wrong direction (Ooh, ooh)
How did you sweep me right off my feet?
Baby, I can't keep
Fallin' in the wrong direction
How did you sweep me right off my feet?
Right off my feet

Couldn't even see you through the smoke
Lookin' back, I probably should have known
But I just wanted to believe that you were out sleepin' alone

Loved me with your worst intentions
Didn't even stop to question (No)
Every time you burned me down (Me down)
Don't know how; for a moment it felt like heaven
Loved me with your worst intentions
Painted us a happy ending (Ooh)
Every time you burned me down (Me down)
Don't know how; for a moment, it felt like heaven

And it's so gut-wrenchin'
Fallin' in the wrong direction

Lyrics:

Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah
Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah
Doo-bee-doo-bee

Where do I begin?
I'm sittin' here jaded
Yeah, I fell asleep with my makeup still on my skin
Wide awake again
I'm prayin' I make it
I step in the twelve but it's somewhere I've already been

Diamonds won't fool me 'cause I'm too far gone
Wish I could get back the air in my lungs
I've been so fucked up it's bad for my heart
My heart

So, no more I love you's (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
It's too easy to say, yeah (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
No more I love you's (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
Until I'm okay (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)

Yeah, I blamed it on the time zones (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
I blamed it on my eyes closed (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
I blamed it on the world like it owes me (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
So stop me before it's too late (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
No more I love you's (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
Until I'm okay (Doo-bee-doo-bee)

Oh, I face my sins
And I wish it was easy
Now I fall asleep with the light on but still without you
So I'll make amends
And I'll buy myself flowers
And then when they die, I'll be happy that they got me through

Diamonds won't fool me 'cause I'm too far gone
Wish I could get back the air in my lungs
I've been so fucked up it's bad for my heart
My heart

So, no more I love you's (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
It's too easy to say, yeah (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
No more I love you's (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
Until I'm okay (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)

Yeah, I blamed it on the time zones (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
I blamed it on my eyes closed (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
I blamed it on the world like it owes me (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
So stop me before it's too late (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
No more I love you's (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
Until I'm okay (Doo-bee-doo-bee)

It's not on my lips and I love it
No weight on my chest, I'm above it
I'm taking a moment to cut it out (Oh)
I feel my conscience is callin'
Now there's no fear, no more runnin'
I don't want words that mean nothin', no

Oh, no more I love you's (No, no more I love you's)
It's too easy to say, yeah (It's too easy to say)
No more I love you's (No)
Until I'm okay (Until I'm okay), yeah

I blamed it on the time zones (Time zones)
I blamed it on my eyes closed (Eyes closed)
I blamed it on the world like it owes me (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
So stop me before it's too late (Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah)
No more I love you's (Ooh, no)
Until I'm okay (Until I'm okay)

Lyrics:
Aye
When it come to you
Pistol I bust 
Issue with trust
Won’t let no one get a piece of your love
Yeah, base it on loyalty base it on us
I ain’t the picture-perfect type 
But I’m making it up
You say you want a bag flipper
I can’t get enough
I’m rich alone but when I’m with you 
I’m richer as fuck
Forbidden fruit on apple juice
Can I sip on the cup
Mix it with some 1942 and I’m hitting you up

Girl you chosen
Fuck it up when you bust wide open
It’s an ocean
I’m just imposing that you give it to me 
And just me only yeah
Girl you chosen
Fuck it up when you bust wide open
It’s an ocean
I’m just imposing that you give it to me 
And just me only

Girl you chosen
Sign this NDA, no you can’t bring no phones in
We walkin in there like what’s all the commotion
No he can’t step a foot in here if we don’t know him
Treat you special girl I hit you with the roses
Cancel your boyfriend he’s too controlling
Get along better with me
Fuck it up when you bust wide open

Girl you chosen
Fuck it up when you bust wide open
It’s an ocean
I’m just imposing that you give it to me 
And just me only yeah
Girl you chosen
Fuck it up when you bust wide open
It’s an ocean
I’m just imposing that you give it to me 
And just me only

Yeah I fuck with her
Brand new Rollie got you frozen
Two more shots got that pussy wide open
Say she wanna go another round don’t provoke him
Shawty up and down on the pole like she voting
I like when you talk that shit to me
Bitches ain’t nothing new 
but you know how to do it to me
Ass up face down we can make a lil movie
I’m the rapper you the groupie
Got it wetter than jacuzzi
She love me like Lucy
I’m a dog, I’m a dog like Snoopy
Getting head under sheets and you sweating out ya weave
Rich n*gga I ain’t cheap when I like what I see

Girl you chosen
Fuck it up when you bust wide open
It’s an ocean
I’m just imposing that you give it to me 
And just me only yeah
Girl you chosen
Fuck it up when you bust wide open
It’s an ocean
I’m just imposing that you give it to me 
And just me only

Lyrics:

I’m in rare form know that they praying for him to stop (I won’t) 
New foreign I just did a coupe tour in the lot (Let’s go) 
Entertaining the opps know it hurt ‘em to watch  
Never heard of this watch but I still gotta cop  
I just touched down threw a surprise party for Pops 
Back in the field you know it’s more to the plot 
I ain’t even checkin the scoreboard I stopped (What for?) 
Double up on this world tour then drop again 
While you looking for a block to spin 
I’m international Blxst you can’t box me in  
My circle full of elites we could not be them 
Put a lot of folks in position guess I gotta be him 
If it’s real let it be known we ain’t gotta pretend 
Long as we got respect we ain’t gotta be friends 
You know hustlers don’t sleep I embody the trend 
Maybe that be the reason she keep calling, she keep calling again  
 
Yeah  
Keep calling hmm I keep ballin 
Baby I’m standing on business so flawless 
Sheee 
Baby my diamonds still hit and they flawless 
Yeah  
Aye they keep calling hmm I keep on ballin 
Baby I’m standing on business so flawless 
Sheee 
Baby my diamonds still hit and they flawless 
 
Phone ringing she got the news 
I’m movin on you ain’t get the clue? 
You did me wrong I’m done with you 
Ten thousand blues what I’m thumbin through 
Picking up my… in this Bentayga  
Fly her out the way secret location 
Kiss her on the lips right before breakfast 
Coppin Van Cleef nigga with the extras  
Rose gold piece and the diamonds special 
Pulled of in the Porsche playing My Confessions 
I just play the game never sweat her 
Knew I had to change got my bread up 
I keep ballin putting in work still turning down offers 
International with it yeah I get it round the globe 
I’m focused on growth nigga staying on my toes what’s happenin 
 
Yeah  
Keep calling hmm I keep ballin 
Baby I’m standing on business so flawless

Lyrics

You be trippin on the time we don’t spend
I pull up and gotta slide once again
You signed up said you’d ride to the end
Yeah
But you don’t wanna be alone
If it’s something on your mind let me in
(Let me know)
I be hoping that the vibe never end 
I just hope you know that I understand
That you don’t wanna be alone

I been on the late night
Making sure your plate right
You be paranoid hearing sirens again (sheee)
I been tryna make time
I been movin statewide
Hope I’m on the safe side 
Flyin in the wind
Aye
You know I double back
Right after running laps
I thought you wanted a hustler 
Girl it come with that
I need that duck off duffle
I need that humble pack
And I’m tryna put you on to something
You ain’t never had

You be trippin on the time we don’t spend
I pull up and gotta slide once again
You signed up said you’d ride to the end
Yeah
But you don’t wanna be alone
If it’s something on your mind let me in
(Let me know)
I be hoping that the vibe never end 
I just hope you know that I understand
That you don’t wanna be alone

Cause lately I been stingy with the time
I hate to say you killin off the vibe
Play your position 
You the realest on my side
Cause you the one I mention on my mind
You be pressing on my line
Look , I promise imma try
To get it right 
But I got money on my mind 
You say it aint always bout money all the time
Yeah
But she don’t wanna be alone 

You be trippin on the time we don’t spend
(Ohhh)
I pull up and gotta slide once again
(Ohhh)
You signed up said you’d ride to the end
Yeah
But you don’t wanna be alone
If it’s something on your mind
(Let me know)
I be hoping that the vibe never end 
I just hope you know that I understand
That you don’t wanna be alone

You be trippin on the time we don’t spend

Lyrics:
Cold heart, she ain't with it
Hard to love again and I get it (sheesh)
Time and time she tried to deal with it
But fuck boys fuck it up for real niggas, yeah
I been in my bag for a minute
I got time today I might spend it
I'm just tryna say I might heal it
But fuck boys fuck it up for real niggas, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Know you heard a lotta broken promises
Like how he's gonna treat you better ,then he did the opposite
Come and let me show you what the difference is
I got it, keep your wallet in your purse 'cause we ain't splittin' shit
Tickets is booked, got a Michelin cook
When these bitches give looks I don't give 'em no push
Give you love and affection, trust and attention
One bad ex really fucked up the next one
Yeah, I won't forfeit but bringin' baggage from your past
Gonna make this be a short trip
Questionin' me daily sayin' baby please don't play me
I say, girl, I understand I do but at a certain point
Gotta take the steerin' wheel back and reach a turnin' point
Always tryna argue every other night
Girl, who the fuck is he to fuck you up for life?
Cold heart, she ain't with it (yeah)
Hard to love again and I get it (sheesh)
Time and time she tried to deal with it
But fuck boys fuck it up for real niggas, yeah
I been in my bag for a minute
I got time today I might spend it
I'm just tryna say I might heal it
But fuck boys fuck it up for real niggas, yeah
Yeah, yeah
'Cause I know what you need
But we can take it slow and I'll let you lead
I know you heard it all before but this a new breed
And I been respected, you can check the newsfeed
I don't got time to waste
But for you I'm willin' to spend all the time it take
Your heart the last thing I'm tryna break
If I don't come correct gotta find a way
You just gotta set the bar for me
It's hard to reach
For a lame type nigga, but not for me
I'm tryna kill whatever guy curiosity
Lil' baby it's the way you keep it on lock for me
We may fall off track, we may lose contact
But you know we gon' get right back
And it be like that, we go beyond that
So you know we gone get right back
You know that I got you
Cold heart, she ain't with it
Hard to love again and I get it (sheesh)
Time and time she tried to deal with it
But fuck boys fuck it up for real niggas, yeah
I been in my bag for a minute
I got time today I might spend it
I'm just tryna say I might heal it
But fuck boys fuck it up for real niggas, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Lyrics:
Ye
You the type I really vibe with 
So I forever keep it solid 
We go public or keep it private, Ye 
Ain’t no hesitation about it 
No competition, babe
Got it like you got it  
So I forever keep it solid 
We go public or keep it private, Ye 
Ain’t no hesitation about it 
And if I Dey for you na forever 
We Dey vibe as long as we  Dey together
Baby no time its now or never 
Because the way the body Dey bounce no regular 
There’s ups and downs to say I’m imperfect 
Love is beautiful, but it comes with hurting 
The keys and purses may defeat the purpose 
Love is really deep that meets the surface yeaaaa
You the type I really vibe with 
Hold me down I forever keep it solid 
We can go public or move in silence 
Ye, chee
Ain’t no hesitation about it
No competition mam, they don’t got it like you got it 
Hold me down I forever keep it solid 
We go public or keep it private, Ye 
Ain’t no hesitation about it 
You know the streets I’m juggling
but you’re the only piece I’m puzzling 
Gal you Dey give me peace no trouble ye
It your choice, get a rolls Royce color den
You know the bag got to keep on coming in 
Promise the only time need to run it up again
I gotta make the street freeze before the summer end
I hope you understand bring you back another win
Yeaaa
You the type I really vibe with 
Hold me down I forever keep it solid 
We can go public or move in silence 
Ye, chee
Ain’t no hesitation about it
No competition mam, they don’t got it like you got it 
Hold me down I forever keep it solid 
We go public or keep it private, Ye 
Ain’t no hesitation about it 
And if they ask yea
Make sure you don’t lack yea 
Make sure you on task for it no cap on it
I like it when you brag on me
The shit deep for real 
Deeper what they see for real 
I’m playing for keeps for real
Queen recognize queen for real
That’s me for real, real
They ain’t  know how to treat you
They ain’t know how to keep you 
Everyone before might as well keep score on how to please you 
Maybe they ain’t see you
You the type I really vibe with 
Hold me down I forever keep it solid 
We can go public or move in silence 
Ain’t no hesitation about it
No competition mam, they don’t got it like you got it 
Hold me down I forever keep it solid 
We go public or keep it private, Ye 
Ain’t no hesitation about it 
And if I Dey for you na forever 
We Dey vibe as long as we  Dey together
Baby no time its now or never 
Because the way the body Dey bounce no regular 
There’s ups and downs but who said I’m imperfect 
Love is beautiful  but it comes with hurting

Lyrics:
Put me on top city on lock they like “When you gon drop?” 
He done shook the game up when he gon pop 
Yeah they know the name but is he gon stop 
Back-to-back runnin fucking up the whole summer 
On the road imma take the whole globe from ‘em 
We ain’t had enough  
Niggas speaking down but they know who comin up 

And I’m still on my way  
But the top don’t look too far from me 
Never called off not one day  
And I’m still on my way  
Still on my way
 
Yeah 
I’m just greedy like Chubbz with a hustle like Pooh 
Tryna get it out the mud like what else I’m supposed to do  
It was in my blood shit my family even knew 
‘22 I blew  
I owe everything to Tru 
Something outta nothing that’s a cold situation 
Know they prolly hot but they froze in the faces 
I didn’t even rush I was chosen but patient 
Feelin like Russ I went gold out the basement 
Get it by the cases runnin Evgle chains by the dozen 
Told gang that I love ‘em it’s a whole celebration  
Barely getting started but still gotta embrace it 
When it’s from the bottom it’s a different foundation  
Yeah 
It’s a different bag waiting on the other side I just want to live in salvation 
We ain’t had enough  
Niggas speaking down but they know who comin up 

And I’m still on my way  
But the top don’t look too far from me 
Never called off not one day  
And I’m still on my way  
Still on my way 

And I’m still on my way  
But the top don’t look too far from me 
Never called off not one day  
But I’m still on my way

MC Davi 
O desespero do meu travesseiro
Virou pesadelo (tem seu cheiro la )2x
O meu espelho me chamou de feio 
Gelado chuveiro (está sem funcionar) 2x

Meu guarda roupa quebrou a porta 
Minha geladeira não tá cheia não
As minhas roupas me ignora 
mais ce tu precisar voltar a luz vai estar acesa 

Fecha a porta apaga a luz e concentra e senta 
Vai descendo em mim em câmera lenta 
Sei que tu gosta eu sei que tu aguenta 
Sei que tu aguenta 2x

MC Don Juan 
Juro que estou me esforçando para não terminar 
Me desagradar para te agradar difícil Ta 
Ela me xinga, mama, me Arranha 
Esta menina é bipolar, é bipolar...
Eu vou com carinho, ela quer com força
Ela bota mão, depois bota boca,
Ela gosta que nois e vida louca
Ela ama que noix e vida louca 2x

MC G15 
E lembra daquela mina bandida 
Fui nela dizia que era sua amiga é conversa
Falava o tempo todo que era melhor do que você ,
Hoje nós Ta cheio de mulher vem, 
A revoada começou 
Depois que tudo isto acaba eu fico no cao 
Eu lembro daquela mandraka me chamando de amor 

Ela sentava sem cao vem, 
Na minha pica meu amor 2x

Fecha,  fecha , fecha, a porta apaga a luz
E concentra e senta senta 
Fecha a porta apaga a luz e concentra e senta senta

MC Pedrinho  
Pra mim tanto faz 
Se eu tenho ou não tenho ela aqui 
prometi jamais sofrer de amor vou ser feliz
quanto tempo que eu não saio pra zoar 
mais agora tem baile eu vou estar la 

Vivendo várias conhecendo se me encontrar 
Já sei que está sabendo 2x

Que eu tô firmão longe de stress 
Fugindo do cao caindo pro jet 
Que eu tô firmão longe d stress 
Brindado de fe caindo pro jet

MC Ryan 
Eu quebrei a cara em uma relação 
Sei da importância de se confiar 
No peito calejado e a decepção 
Di si apaixonar meu voto de confiança deixei na ciroc 
Vários bailes vários combos eu dei vários goles 
Mais sempre que eu trombo ela ainda entro em choque 
Sinto falta da sua cara e causa um hipnose 
Minha boca e tipo sol e sua boca e tipo a lua 
No eclipse do amor minha boca beija a sua 
Então vem me visitar minha porta não Ta trancada 
Meu colo senti saudade da sua sentada 

Abre a porta apaga a luz e concentra e senta 
Vai descendo em mim em câmera lenta 
Sei que tu gosta mano eu sei que tu aguenta ela aguenta 

Abre a porta apaga a luz e concentra e senta 
Sei que ela gosta mano sei que ela aguenta, 
Sei que ela gosta mano sei que ela 
Aguenta sei que ela aguenta

MC Jottape
Eu tenho dó é do lençol 
Que nunca fica esticado na cama
Eu tenho dó do edredom
Que sempre ta no chão
Sete dias da semana

Coitado do travesseiro 
Nem consegue dormir
Com tanta mordida

E o pé da cama ta com gesso 
Quebrou em mil pedaços 
Com essa rotina

Eu até desisti 
De arrumar a minha cama
Acho que agora eu vou levar
Elas pro chão

Nem king star que quando um mexe 
O outro não sente
Ta aguentando o desce sobe 
De bundão

Desce sobe de bundão
Desce sobe de bundão
Quebrar a cama é fácil quero ver
Quebrar o chão

Desce sobe de bundão
Desce sobe de bundão
Quebrar a cama é fácil quero ver
Quebrar o chão

Fecha a porta
Apaga a luz se concentra e senta
Vai descendo em mim 
em camera lenta
Sei que tu gosta e eu sei
Que tu aguenta 
Eu sei que tu aguenta

Fecha a porta
Apaga a luz se concentra e senta
Vai descendo em mim 
em camera lenta
Sei que tu gosta e eu sei
Que tu aguenta 
Eu sei que tu aguenta 

Gaab 
Vai sentando e não para subindo 
E não para descendo e não para 4x

Não si compara ela senta e distrava ela prepara 4x

Ela quer carinho, ela quer com força 
Ela bota a mão depois bota a boca ela 
Gosta que noix e vida louca , 
Ela gosta que noix e vida louca 2x

MC Menor da VG
Minha menina me olha e me dá a mão 
Não, não vou deixar você mais ir embora 
Eu sei que você curti um malandrão 
Então, Eu to aqui vem logo me namora

Você sabia que era o meu sonho 
Bem debochada me deixou partir
Te conheci lá no bailão do morro 
Agora que eu não quero tá afim 

To de meiota com a bandida na minha garupa 
Passei por ela e aí ela ficou nervosa 
Dei mo moral vc não quis agora luta
Que eu to afim de revoa com essas maluca 

Fecha a porta apaga luz se concentra e senta 
Vai descendo em min em câmera lenta (2)
Sei que tu gosta e eu sei que tu aguenta

Letra:
[MC Davi]
Olha o que você falou
Esses dias assim, eu não quero mais
Esse é o nosso fim
Que você só quer sair, quer aproveitar
Solteira e ser feliz, beber com as amigas
Sinto que tu se arrependeu, assunto quer puxar
O amor não venceu, eu vou me afastar
Eu vou me afastar
Eu vou me afastar
Eu vou me afastar

Então me faça um favor, quando você for
Apague meu número, não ligue mais
Que eu vou tocar o terror, me negaram amor
Eu só vou sorrindo, se fodeu se vim pedindo mais

Então me faça um favor, quando você for
Apague meu número, não ligue mais
Não volte atrás, não volte atrás
Eu vou tocar o terror, me negaram amor
Eu só vou sorrindo, se perdeu

[Gaab]
Olha o que você falou, depois que acabou meu amor
Depois de decratar o nosso fim
Depois de meter mó marra, depois de jogar na minha cara
Eu te fiz tudo e foi nada, você ta forçando a barra
Toma duas dozinha, fica louquinha
Quer beijar minha boca, sai dessa brisa assadinha
Para de graça coloca a roupa

Então me faça um favor, quando você for
Apague meu número, não ligue mais
Que eu vou tocar o terror, me negaram amor
Eu só vou sorrindo, se fodeu se vim pedindo mais
Pedindo mais, pedindo mais
Se fodeu se vim pedindo mais
Pedindo mais, pedindo mais
Você se fodeu se vim pedindo mais
Pedindo mais, pedindo mais (yeeh)
Você se fodeu se vim pedindo mais
Pedindo mais (yeeh)

[Cynthia Luz]
Eu vi a cena toda, olhei pra sua cara
Senti uma coisa boa, mas to saindo fora
Tem beijo que se gruda não solta
Eu vou deixar meu corpo suar
Perdemos tempo e eu não quero que pense eu vou voltar
O melhor de mim se teve né?, o meu sorrisinho tão leve (é)
Você gosta de mentir pra mim, mas eu já to longe da sua

Então me faça um favor, quando você for
Apague meu número, não me ligue mais
Eu vou tocar o terror, me negaram amor
Eu só vou sorrindo, se fodeu se vim pedindo mais

[Gaab, MC Davi e Cynthia Luz]
Então me faça um favor, quando você for
Apague meu número, não ligue mais
Que eu vou tocar o terror, me negaram amor
Eu só vou sorrindo, se fodeu se vim pedindo mais

[Gaab]
Pedindo mais, pedindo mais
Se fodeu se vim pedindo mais
Pedindo mais, pedindo mais
Você se fodeu se vim pedindo mais
Pedindo mais, pedindo mais (yeeh)
Você se fodeu se vim pedindo mais
Pedindo mais (yeeh)

LYRICS:

I got turned around in some little town 
I’d never been to before 
Working my way through a middle of June 
Midnight thunderstorm 
There was something in the headlights 
That stopped me on a dime 
Well she was scared to death 
So I said climb in and in she climbed 
Oh Yeah

Well she was bruised and broke from head to toe 
With a tear in her blood stained shirt 
She didn’t tell the whole truth 
But she didn’t have to I knew what had happened to her 
I didn’t load her down with questions 
That girl had been through enough 
I just threw it in drive 
Looked in those eyes 
And asked her where he was 

I don’t know if he’s angel 
Cause angels don’t do what he did 
He was hell bent to find the man behind 
All the whiskey scars I hid 
I never thought my day of justice 
Would come from a judge under his seat 
But I knew right then I’d never get hit again when he said to me 
Wait in the truck 
Just wait in the truck 

Well I knocked and knocked and no one came 
So I kicked in his double wide door 
I let the hammer drop before he got to that twelve he was reaching for 
I didn’t try to hide my pistol 
I didn’t even try to run 
I just sat on the porch smoking one of his cigarettes 
And waited for the cops to come 

I don’t know if he’s angel 
Cause angels don’t do what he did 
He was hell bent to find the man behind 
All the whiskey scars I hid 
I never thought my day of justice 
Would come from a judge under his seat 
But I knew right then I’d never get hit again when he said to me 
Wait in the truck 
Just wait in the truck 

Whoa
Have mercy on me Lord 
Have mercy on me 
Have mercy on me Lord 

It’s been sixty months 
And she still comes to to see me from time to time 
It was worth the price to see a brighter side of the girl I picked up that night 
And I might be here forever 
It ain’t paradise that’s true 
But it’s a whole hell of a lot better 
Than the place I sent him to 

Wait in the truck 
Just wait in the truck 
Wait in the truck 
Just wait in the truck 
Have mercy on me lord
Have mercy on me 
Have mercy on me 
Have mercy on me 
Wait in the truck 
Just wait in the truck 
Wait in the truck 
Just wait in the truck

I can hook a trailer on a two inch hitch 
I can shoot a shotgun I can catch a fish 
I can change a tire on the side of a road 
Yeah I know a few things a man oughta know 

CHORUS
How to know when it’s love
How to stay when it’s tough
How to know you’re messing up a good thing 
And how to fix it fore it’s too late
And yea I know a boy
Who gave up and got it wrong
If you really love a woman you don’t let her go 
Yeah I know few things a man oughta know 

If I can’t have it I can do without
I can hang a picture same as I can take it down 
And how to keep it hidden when a heart gets broke 
Yeah, I know a few things a man oughta know 

REPEAT CHORUS

How to know when it’s love
How to stay when it’s tough
How to chase forever down a driveway
How to never let it get there in the first place 
And yea I know a boy
Who gave up and got it wrong
If you really love a woman you don’t let her go 
Yeah I know few things a man oughta know 
Yeah I know few things a man oughta know

Lyrics:
Been working like a dog 
Tryna please em all 
Tryna put another comma in the bank 
Tryna to get these broke down dreams to crank
Sometimes a good good girl’s gotta break out the denim 
Gonna pour me a drink pour my ass in em 
For heaven's sake I need a good time 
Lord knows it ain’t no crime 

To leave a little lipstick red on a solo
Make a little mess of my head on the Cuervo 
I don’t need no help no I got this 
Coming in hot as hell y’all watch this 
Gonna tear up this town like a drunk tornado 
Light it up let it all go 
Tell that angel inside of me to hide her wings and lay low 
Hold my halo 

I gotta neon side 
I let her shine sometimes 
Sitting like a devil on my shoulder 
Tonight I’m gonna let her take over  

And leave a little lipstick red on a solo
Make a little mess of my head on the Cuervo 
I don’t need no help no I got this 
Coming in hot as hell y’all watch this 
Gonna tear up this town like a drunk tornado 
Light it up let it all go 
Tell that angel inside of me to hide her wings and lay low 
Hold my halo

Put it back on in the morning 
Put it back on in the morning 
Put it back on in the morning 
Put it back on put it back 

Sometimes a good good girl’s gotta break out the denim 
Gonna pour me a drink pour my ass in em 
For heaven's sake I need a good time 
Lord knows it ain’t no crime

To leave a little lipstick red on a solo
Make a little mess of my head on the Cuervo 
I don’t need no help no I got this 
Coming in hot as hell y’all watch this 
Gonna tear up this town like a drunk tornado 
Light it up let it all go 
Tell that angel inside of me to hide her wings and lay low 
Hold my halo
Hold my halo 

Put it back on 
Put it back on 
Put it back on in the morning 
Put it back on 
Put it back on 
Put it back on in the morning 
Hold my halo

Lyrics:
Atta girl 
Way to go 
It was time 
To hit the road 
He’s just a boy 
In working boots
It didn’t work so you cut him loose 
Hey atta girl 
You thought it through 
And what you did 
Is hard to do 
I bet you’re thinking bout some things that you shouldn’t 
Just remember now and then that you’re looking 

At a girl who’s got a damn good heart
And some big dreams up ahead 
And now you got you a brand new start and both sides of a queen bed 
He mighta took your love mighta took your time 
And the rug out from under your world 
But he can’t take all your happiness 
Go and get it now 
Atta girl 

He’s at a bar 
With his friends 
That's where ya go
When it ends 
They say atta boy 
Have another round 
There’s plenty girls 
In this college town 
Then he meets one
That’s hurting too 
While he’s kissing her 
He’s missing you 
And now it’s sinking in deep that he missed that train 
He can throw back a drink but he can’t throw blame 

At a girl who’s got a damn good heart
And some big dreams up ahead 
And now you got you a brand new start and both sides of a queen bed 
He mighta took your love mighta took your time 
And the rug out from under your world 
But he can’t take all your happiness 
Go and get it now 
Atta girl

At a girl who’s got a damn good heart
And some big dreams up ahead 
And now you got you a brand new start and both sides of a queen bed 
He mighta took your love mighta took your time 
And the rug out from under your world 
But he can’t take all your happiness 
Go and get it now 
Atta girl

He mighta took your love 
It'll take time 
But you’ll find your way in this world 
Whatever’s gonna bring you happiness 
Go and get it now atta girl 
Go and get it now atta girl

Show me how you care, 
Tell me how you were loved before 
Show me how you smile, 
Tell me why your hands are cold 

I’m turning around, 
I’m having visions of you 
But then I understand 
The friend I’m dreaming of is far away 
But I’m here... I’m here 

Show me how you’re proud, 
Tell me how you reach the moon 

My thoughts err away tonight

Numb

Hon, please forgive me if I ever did you wrong
I'll be your candle; burn me upside down
From now on, I won't sleep on my arms

Numb, is how I feel deep inside my soul
Need to feel that I am on the line
I'm sorry that I dragged you down my way

Hon, I never meant to cheat you out of time
In cold mornings when our sheets are warm
I see a flower with no needles on (so far)

Stung, and there's a bee that gave it all away
Pretty eyes now filled with pain
A young confusion, what a shame",True,True,46508509.0,indie pop

Billie cares to hold me
But I found I’m bound and headed upside down
Billie dressing easy
And I do enjoy the way he tucks me now
Pulley Bee’
Dragging me around

Billie cares to wake me
And I’ll bend my knees neatly to its needs
Billie will be tidy
Tough as rocky streams, steady is the speed
Pulley Bee’
Hauling is your creed

[Your] Heels twist in a ballet
Whenever you’re in pain, don’t turn to blame
You see a lamb who’s fast asleep 
Please don’t go out to stray

Billie by my lips dear
[And] I can almost taste the smoky trail of myrrh
Whispers in my left ear
And I swear, you’re near, the wary one I hear
Pulley Bee’
Idles in high gear

[Your] Heels twist in a ballet
[You’re] Stuck in a ballet

Please, don’t turn to blame

I hope to be around
The day we grasp in truth
The nature of mind
Befriending time, in truth

In a midway I stand where many stood
Only to come home again
Walking through these streets I know too well
But my thoughts stray away

I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself
Without any end

I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself
In truth

I wonder at this light
Enclosed in our soul, in truth
And bid our clay remain,
Soft as it is, in truth

In a midway I stand where many stood
Only to come home again
Walking through these streets I know too well
But my thoughts stray away

I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself
Without any end

Lyrics
You make no sound
As folks gather ‘round,
Like shadow hounds
Eyes seem unsound
As folks gather 'round
And please you aloud

And I now believe that no one asked
About your secret past
The pain to match your strength

And I now believe that no one thought
You had a lonely past
The pain and strengths so vast

From mellow seas,
To houses on wheels,
To slabs in West lands,
Hand in hand
From yellow bills,
To slabs in West lands,
Like bones in your hands

But I see a tree that's standing high among the shrubs
So only one hand may rest its palm upon my cheeks
The only one that I'll need

To know why no one asked
About your secret past
The pain to match your strength

And I now believe that no one thought
You had a lonely past
And pain to match your vein
When it rains",True,True,11390584.0,indie pop

Lyrics
I ran out of made up consolations
I’ve been waiting forever
How can you call me with such conviction?
“Sugar cane, sugar “

You get yourself out of situations
Won’t you leave me, won’t you?
‘Cause I don’t have the time for indignations
“Sugar cane, sugar”

It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again

Can you find just one thing you cherish?
Would you hold me just like you mean it?
Am I the one with much imagination?
Give me one reason

As it gets older,
You keep pulling and pushing away
But you never promised me
To be wiser or better

It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again

It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again",True,True,18441230.0,indie pop

Seven

In the shadows he saw four eyes, lit by fire… fire 
He’d never done that with a lover, before…before 
Meanwhile everyone else got lost in quiet, by the rivier 
Seeking for more, of course he found better…better 

He saw them, they saw him 
But everyone just kept on going 
What he saw was different 
He should have gone to bed 
But instead he stuck around for the mood 

In the shadows he saw four eyes, lit by fire… fire 
He’d never done that with a lover, before…before 
Either early or too late, it was number seven… and it happened 
High like a bird with his beak through the window 

He saw them, they saw him 
But everyone just kept on going 
What he saw was different 
He should have gone to bed 
But instead he stuck around for the mood

AMOR E FÉ
To aqui na sua frente meio bagunçado
Cheguei com o volume do som topado
Lembrei do rolê domingo passado
Aí ‘cê’ lembra bem, nada é impossível
Tudo é invisível
Pra quem só olha pra si
Não é bem assim
É coisa de outro nível
Eu me acho incrível quando ‘cê’ olha pra mim -  E gosto assim
Ta pra nascer um maloqueiro disposto a soltar o dedo só por causa dela
Ai eu penso o tempo inteiro e até bate o desespero, o que sou eu sem ela
Eu danço com a nossa fumaça, me abraça no conversível, segura minha mão
Até o radar tirou uma foto e se ‘nóis’ tivesse de moto, não pegava não
.
Hoje ‘nóis’ bota pra fude, ver o sol nascer, fazer o que ‘cê’ quiser
‘Nóis’ inventa outro rolê, um jeito de viver, só com amor e fé
Hoje ‘nóis’ bota pra fude, ver o sol nascer, fazer o que ‘cê’ quiser
‘Nóis’ inventa outro rolê, um jeito de viver, só com amor e fé
.
Eu acho até que a fé é suficiente pra viver, se põe junto com o amor, fudeu
E nada mais é como antes, nem fácil o bastante pra ver
Difícil entender que o sol de hoje não é o mesmo de ontem
Eu e meu mundo imaginário, 30 mil de salário
Era nós dois, deixando esses problemas pra depois
Era só bar, estúdio, os shows lotados. ‘Mó’ clima de paz. Revólver guardado
Se tudo der errado, eu vou sorrir e brincar com esse destino
As vezes todo mundo volta a ser menino
Aí revive e aprende tudo, nessa escola é só lição
Tudo é diversão
De brincar por nada
Sentar na calçada e conversar besteira
Mente bagunçada com várias parada e ‘nóis’ de bobeira
De brincar por nada
Sentar na calçada e conversar besteira
Mente bagunçada com várias parada e ‘nóis’ de bobeira
.
Ta pra nascer um maloqueiro disposto a soltar o dedo só por causa dela
Ai eu penso o tempo inteiro e até bate o desespero, o que sou eu sem ela
Eu danço com a nossa fumaça, me abraça no conversível, segura minha mão

Letra:
Dropei no Atlântico de bote 
Pra pescar piranha
Anzol tem que ser forte, mas nós tem a manha
É só Juliette e Roche, Final de semana
Começa nas ilhas, terminar em Angra
Descontrolei nos drinks, MD rosa e Open bar
Aqui não tem wifi, mas nós vamos navegar
O Aquaman tá diferente, perdeu a postura
De lança na mão e peça na cintura
--
Não pula não, que esse mar tem tubarão
A rabeta da sereia, bate junto com o gravão
Não pula não, que esse mar tem tubarão.
Mas sente o cheiro de longe, se ta na maldade ou não.

É doce, marola e suor
A bela sentando em slow
Brincando por cima, da dó
A filha da puta da show
Nós não perde um chute no gol
A garrafa de whisky secou
Revoada apita de novo, que o sócio da rua é que patrocinou
--
To vivendo num mundo aquático
Ver maldade em nós é telepático
Quer problema, nós é problemático
Sem caô pra quem quer ser simpático
Vi o tempo fechado e vi colorir
Vi os golpe caindo num golpe feio
É que o mundo é o dobro do tempo, fio
Nós é filho do dono do mundo, eu sei
Favelando e andando em 50 pés
Mas meus pés calejados é de luta
É que nós não abate esses decibéis 
E tem três disputando a garupa
E o jet-ski roncando alto, ta tipo robô
Tem Masserat, Porsche azul bebe, ....
--
Não pula não, que esse mar tem tubarão
A rabeta da sereia, bate junto com o gravão
Não pula não, que esse mar tem tubarão.
Mas sente o cheiro de longe, se ta na maldade ou não.
--
A maldade dentro do meu copo
Tão falando que eu ganhei na loto
Nosso sonho é tipo terremoto
Coleção de Ferrari e de moto
--
As dona tão perdendo a linha
Ter meu vulgo dentro da calcinha
Nem conheço, mas já quer ser minha
No Jet, tubarão e Hungria
To vivendo, mas geral não sabe
Um terço do que eu já passei
Hoje nas ruas de Brasília, o Tubarão é rei
--
Pelo andar da carruagem não vai ter jeito não
Os recalcados vão morrer do coração
Mas pelo andar da carruagem, não vai jeito não
Os recalcados vão morrer do coração
--
dropei no Atlântico de bote 
Pra pescar piranha
Lá tem que ser forte, mas nós tem a manha
É só Juliette e Roche, Final de semana
Começa nas ilhas, terminar em Angra

Letra:
É impossível tentar esquecer
Aquelas treta e o cheiro da merenda da escola
A cada letra que nós canetou, até os professor, dali achava foda
Uma aparência meio fragilizada, era nós de quebrada, nesses sol das seis
E minha mãe tava desempregada, com a agenda lotada pra criar nós três
Dos olhos caiam uma chuva em pleno verão
Em casa faltava até água e chovia unção

Maior que o temporal é a fé que habita em mim
Um vendaval de sonho e realização
Maior que o temporal é a fé que habita em mim
Só vai sentar na mesa quem rachou o pão

Maior que o temporal é a fé que habita em mim
Um vendaval de sonho e realização
Maior que o temporal é a fé que habita em mim
Só vai sentar na mesa quem rachou o pão

""Eu acho que a dificuldade ninguém escolhe passar, entendeu?
 A tempestade que vai passar, ninguém sabe
E aqui foi tanta tempestade que a gente aprendeu a dançar na chuva""

Água de mar só me lembra gosto de choro, é salgada, mas ensina mais que professor
E dinheiro nenhum no mundo paga água derramada pelos olhos onde só a alma já nadou
Eu naveguei na tempestade, nós é lenha de verdade, fogo que Deus acendeu e a chuva não apagou.
Num comecei a sonhar brincando, eu comecei a sonhar chorando com a comida quase que o gás acabou
Pensei se a fé for do tamanho de um grão de mostarda
Troco montanhas de lugares na ponta do dedo
E quando eu descobrir a força de cada detalhe, seria covardia minha não ensinar o segredo

Maior que o temporal é a fé que habita em mim
Um vendaval de sonho e realização
Maior que o temporal é a fé que habita em mim
Só vai sentar na mesa quem rachou o pão

Maior que o temporal é a fé que habita em mim
Um vendaval de sonho e realização
Maior que o temporal é a fé que habita em mim
Só vai sentar na mesa quem rachou o pão

Quem acreditou, que abraçou a causa e foi sujeito homem
Não abandonou, hoje bebe o que nós bebe e come o que nos come
E quem me guardou na memória, comemora, que eu sinto que é nossa hora
Em qualquer noite aleatória, onde a saveiro fez história
Só contando as precatória, mandando as dedicatória e o frasco do perfume com o cheiro da vitória

A divisão vai ser igual, não posso fazer feio,
Se eu tenho um acredita, então nós dois tem meio
Qual é a graça do sorriso egoísta que não deu casa pra mãe,
mas só desce champagne na pista aiai

Dos olhos caiam uma chuva em pleno verão
Em casa faltava até água chovia unção

Maior que o temporal é a fé que habita em mim
Um vendaval de sonho e realização
Maior que o temporal é a fé que habita em mim
Só vai sentar na mesa quem rachou o pão

Maior que o temporal é a fé que habita em mim
Um vendaval de sonho e realização
Maior que o temporal é a fé que habita em mim
Só vai sentar na mesa quem rachou o pão",True,True,9550515.0,hip hop music

Já pensou se eu tivesse parado
Desistido no meio do caminho
Quando a chuva escorria na telha
E a mesa mais farta era a do vizinho?
Quantas vezes me senti sozinho
Incapaz de olhar pro espelho
Mas capaz de exercer minha fé
E expressar minha dor chorando de joelho

Lembro do sonho das Audi, da fumaceira no breu
Da playboyzada e dos Opala, queima de pneu
Vi quatro amigo meu ir pro crime de otário
Vi cinco preto na favela virar empresário

Tanto faz se minha mãe já chorou
Se o sorriso dela tá tão lindo
É que hoje eu posso te dar
Um abraço mais puro, um carro, um vestido
E se fosse por quem já falou
Que o moleque não ia durar
Que trocou o revólver no amor
E quis cantar rap, não quis estudar

Agora é champ e nave rebaixada
O jet no engate da danada
Daqui pra Riviera é quase nada
Descendo a Baixada, sente a acelerada

Um dia eu vi uma estrela cadente e fiz um pedido
Creio, fui atendido
Era só um menino brincando com os amigo
Fiz essa aqui pra relembrar daqueles que estavam comigo
Dividindo o sorriso
Tudo que eu acredito, não demora, eu conquisto

Na sacada, as modelo tomando Sol
Copo de 43 junto com Aperol
As corrente brilhando tipo farol
Tipo jogador caro de futebol
Quanto vale o poder do migué
No ouvido de uma mulher?
Eu falei bem no cantinho dela
Fala baixinho, que nóis é favela

Agora é champ e nave rebaixada
O jet no engate da danada
Daqui pra Riviera é quase nada
Descendo a Baixada, sente a acelerada

Um dia eu vi uma estrela cadente e fiz um pedido
Creio, fui atendido
Era só um menino brincando com os amigo
Fiz essa aqui pra relembrar daqueles que estavam comigo

LETRA:
Tem coração de carro forte
Carrega a riqueza de um maloqueiro
Foi lost eu cai num golpe
Junto com o Setor Marista inteiro
Acho que o beijo dela é mágico
Com efeito trágico, 
Misturou whisky e amor
No copão de plástico
O seu sorriso sádico, olhar emblemático,
nenhum matemático resolveu esse caô

Ooo, vou assaltar seu coração de carro forte
Ooo, eu vou dar fuga e te levar dentro da Porsche
Ooo, vou assaltar seu coração de carro forte
Ooo, eu vou dar fuga e te levar dentro da Porsche

Já tenho um mês bolando um plano
E um colete que eu não pago pra ver
Que seu olhar é uma rajada de umas quatro PT
De balaclava pra você não poder reconhecer
Lá no barraco eu tiro tudo e você põe pra fu…
E foi o maior o prejuízo que a Prosegur levou
Dinheiro é pra quem tem preço, eu tô querendo o seu valor
Tô com a mulher que já parou metade do Setor Bueno
O beijo dela tem o gosto de remédio com veneno
É foda

Já partiu dez mil corações no meio
Arregaçou com esse Goiás inteiro
Dançou em cima de várias Saveiro
Foda-se o dinheiro

Tem coração de carro forte
Carrega a riqueza de um maloqueiro
Foi lost eu cai num golpe
Junto com o Setor Marista inteiro
Acho que o beijo dela é mágico
Com efeito trágico, 
Misturou whisky e amor
No copão de plástico
O seu sorriso sádico, olhar emblemático,
nenhum matemático resolveu esse caô

Ooo, vou assaltar seu coração de carro forte
Ooo, eu vou dar fuga e te levar dentro da Porsche
Ooo, vou assaltar seu coração de carro forte
Ooo, eu vou dar fuga e te levar dentro da Porsche

Tudo que ela quer fazer
Eu faço acontecer
Pra esse sorriso nascer
Eu troco a lua de lugar
Faço até uma privê
Te levo lá pra Jurerê
Com 4 gramas de MD
E chamo o Alok pra tocar

A boca dela é tão comum
Mas o beijo dela é foda
Tipo gosto de gin com gelo, limão e soda
E seu design é diferente
Essa nave não aceita carona
É tipo as Porsche GT2 com a traseira grandona
Eita vidinha cigana que me leva pra você
Que me prende a noite toda nesse seu mesmo rolê
Eternizamos os momentos, nosso filme sem dublê
Tipo romance com perigo que eu pago pra ver

Tem coração de carro forte
Carrega a riqueza de um maloqueiro
Foi lost eu cai num golpe
Junto com o Setor Marista inteiro
Acho que o beijo dela é mágico
Com efeito trágico, 
Misturou whisky e amor
No copão de plástico
O seu sorriso sádico, olhar emblemático,
nenhum matemático resolveu esse caô

Ooo, vou assaltar seu coração de carro forte

Letra:
Só era nós, Só era nós, Oooa
Só era nós, Só era nós, Oooa
Só era nos com as roupas numa sacola, sorrindo querendo chorar
Só era nós voltando a pé da escola, sonhando com a JMA

Eu lembro, eim?!

Barraco escuro, becos obscuros, pichações no muro,
filhos prematuros, com pouco futuro, eu juro
tentei ser maduro, mas ver meu pai duro, eu até chorei
Sem o dinheiro do mercado hoje fazia um mês

A fome era bem maior que a TV dos boy
E se vendesse o preço dava umas 20 Caloi
Só eu sei como dói, nós era 3 irmãos
barraco alugado, só um colchão no chão

Se eu for contar só de despejo não cabe no dedo
Carrinho de mão, nossa mudança começava cedo
Ai batia um medo, a lágrima de dor
E a vergonha de pedir pra morar de favor

Salário mínimo é o máximo, mundo moderno
Só trampando de segurança que preto usa terno

Só era nos com as roupas numa sacola, sorrindo querendo chorar
Só era nós voltando a pé da escola, sonhando com a JMA
Só era nós, só era nós, sorrindo querendo chorar
Só era nós, só era nós, sonhando com a JMA

Vi minha preta que na luta sempre deu o sangue
Saía às 4 pra limpar bagunça de madame
Dormir pra que se a fé espera, poucas ideias
Às 19h o culto é certo lá na assembléia

Preta de fé, sabe como é sem rastro
Saiu de casa porque apanha do padrasto
Dizer como é, se ver meu rolê é fácil
Guerreira de fé, se eu um dia eu te der um palácio

Só pra te ver plantando orquídea no seu novo jardim
Me acompanhando em cada show no meu novo jatinho
O seu olhar de orgulho vale mais do que um BI
Nunca mais cortaram a luz, lembra, eu prometi

Só era nos com as roupas numa sacola, sorrindo querendo chorar
Só era nós voltando a pé da escola, sonhando com a JMA
Sorrindo querendo chorar
Sonhando com a JMA

Letra:

Até posso morrer tentando
É várias fita, se eu contar, ninguém acredita
A senha que nós digita, deixa um castelo no banco
Geral cogita que a rima que nós recita, se pá até desacredita que toca nos quatro canto

De Lamborghini, com a placa do ano,
Nóis é vitrine, virgulado no pano
Não subestime, eu tô bolando um plano
Então sai da frente que o trem bala tá passando

É outro patamar
E hoje as nave decola, coleção de doze mola pros favela desfilar
É outro patamar
Sinto cheiro da vitória, misturado com a marola, hoje é só fumaça pro ar

Vejo o menor lutando por um futuro brilhante
Hoje maior eu vejo o som tocando nos falante
Sorriso da minha mãe vale mais que um diamante
E a foto dos menor deixei de quadro na estante

Todos mano lucrando ao meu redor
Hoje tá quase tudo bem, só faltou quem se foi pra ta melhor
Nunca vou me render pra ninguém
Minha garganta quase deu um nó
Quando vi minha mãe chorar no trem
Panela vazia mas tinha alegria, hoje a gente vai comer o que tem

Escuta ronco da jaguar
É sinal que ta vindo o sócio duplicar
Nessa bagaça, turismo de graça
Pra ver playboy sem voz e a favela que vai cantar

É outro patamar
E hoje as nave decola, coleção de doze mola pros favela desfilar
É outro patamar
Sente cheiro da vitória, misturado com a marola, hoje é só fumaça pro ar

Enquanto essa guerra excita, é mil fita, nóis transita pelas rua de taguá
Pros capa é só linha na pipa, é cortar e aparar
Eu vou puxar só pela rabiola
Vai ter que admitir que o cerol da favela é foda

Que corta o preconceito, preto também tem respeito
Vim lá do gueto e já to pronto pra voar
Traz o dinheiro que hoje eu vou queimar com o isqueiro
Só acendo esse paiero agora em outro lugar

Até posso morrer tentando
É várias fita, se eu contar, ninguém acredita
A senha que nós digita, deixa um castelo no banco
Geral cogita que a rima que nós recita, se pá até desacredita que toca nos quatro canto

De Lamborghini, com a placa do ano,

Lembrei daquela sexta-feira
Pé descalço e poeira
Menino que se achava dono da quebrada inteira
Disbicando pipa, saudade dessa idade
Nunca tive nada, mas tinha minha vaidade

Entre o sonho da bicicleta
Quem sabe a mobilete
Carrinho de rolimã não atiçava as piriguete
E que se foda o personagem que quer me ver infeliz
Que olha pro meu troféu mas não vê minha cicatriz

Os vizinhos xaropando com o som desses cara-preta
(não abaixa não, não abaixa não, não abaixa não)
Me deixa longe dessa longe dessas treta
Não vou perder meu tempo com indireta na minha letra
(ow trás outra cerveja pra mim aí)
Me deixa longe dessas tretas

Essas dona sensual mexe com minha mente
Me deixa muito louco sem usar entorpecente
Mas eu sou paciente, porém meio delinqüente
Os olhos observam mas o coração que sente

Começo pode ser final, final pode ser começo
A escolha de um sonho claro que vai ter um preço
Hoje é rolê de aro 20, champanhe nessa suíte
Ta vendo o lado bom mas não me viu no madeirite
Então quer me taxar de boy, não sabe meu passado
Quem disse que o favela não pode morar no lago?
E dar um frevo tipo aqueles que rola lá em Dubai
Acordar no outro dia com a ressaca do carai

(REFRÃO)

Eu quero a quebrada sorrindo
E a tristeza na lona
Os pivete jogando nos time de Barcelona
E se hoje ta de Nike já teve com os pés no chão
Pra provar que o corpo pobre a mente rica faz milhão
Quantas vezes no choro já regou meu sonho
O pensamento alto igual nuvem no céu
Talvez seja por isso que hoje componho
Meu sentimento num pedaço de papel.

 Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Growing up in the golden age
Throwing rocks at your window pane
""Kiss me once and I'll float away""
But that ain't me anymore
Well I don't mind if I sell my soul
To get a song on the radio
""Credit cards and my student loans""
That's so millennial

[Chorus]
Do you remember how it feels to be young?
Do you remember?
We could be anyone
Now I miss the view from the floor of your room
September came way too soon
Do you remember how it feels to be young?
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah

[Verse 2]
Remember cutting class we would smoke and chill
It was only gym and lunch
We thought it was real
I was even failing math, I ain't even care
Yeah just to be around you made it worth it
I dropped out, but you still said I'm perfect
I remember at the prom you was perfect
I remember you were walking on graduation day
I never got the chance to say
That I remember all the time that we spent
And I remember you were really my friend
And I remember you were really my friend
And I remember when they all looked and laughed
Now it's crazy how they all on yo ass

[Bridge]
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah baby yeah
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah

[Chorus]
Do you remember how it feels to be young?
Do you remember?
We could be anyone
Now I miss the view from the floor of your room
September came way too soon
Do you remember how it feels to be young?
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah",False,True,206259979.0,alternative dance

✅Les paroles✅
[Couplet 1 : Elams]
Plus de dialogue (non), plus de marche arrière (ouais, ouais)
Oh, my love, pour moi ça y est (ouais, ouais)
Y'a des hauts, y'a des bas, vie d'ghetto, vie de star
On vit de ça, vit de ça, mwana mboka vient du blocka
Qui vivra verra, on s'assagit mais cœur de pirate, ils nous haïssent
On a tout c'qu'ils veulent, oh, oh

[Couplet 2 : Naza]
Fallait peu pour finir ensemble
Tu m'appelles, trop d'promesses au portable
Pour ton cœur, j'retourne ciel et terre
Si ça pète, c'est pas de ma fautе, oh
Y'a plus qu'à ramasser les douilles, tu sais jе me cogne pour nous deux (cogne pour deux)
Et quand je me barre c'est pour un peu mieux t'emmener (mieux t'emmener)
J'ai cassé les portes, j'ai écrit des hits pour nous deux (hits pour nous deux)
N'écoute pas les gens, le mal se répand, tu es dans mon camp, on s'était promis de s'aimer
T'es, t'es ma lumière dans le noir, je me sens bien près de toi
Bébé, il n'y a plus le temps de perdre du temps, c'est sentimental
Dis-moi c'que t'as sur le cœur, mon amour pourrait s'effacer
Bébé, il n'y a plus le temps de perdre du temps, c'est sentimental

[Pont : Tayc]
J'assume mon rôle, assume le tien
Dieu m'a fait homme, c'est pour protéger les miens
Assume le trône, pleure pas pour rien
Tu es ma femme, tu dois assurer mon bien, mm, mm, yeah

[Refrain : Lynda, Jul & SAF]
Oh, bébé tu as serré, j'ai déconné, vien m'faire un busa
On s'est promis de s'aimer, tu sais pourquoi j'fais tout ça
Oh, bébé tu as serré, j'ai déconné, viens m'faire un busa
On s'est promis de s'aimer, tu sais pourquoi j'fais tout ça
Bébé, t'es pas tout seul, seul (t'es pas tout seul), bébé, t'es pas tout seul, seul (t'es pas tout seul)
Bébé, t'es pas tout seul, seul (t'es pas tout seul), bébé, t'es pas tout seul, seul (t'es pas tout seul)

[Couplet 3 : Vegedream]
J'vis la vie d'une rockstar, j'vais le faire pour nous
On devra faire face aux jaloux, je n'veux plus jamais te voir à genoux
Donc j'ai choisi la vie d'une rockstar mais j'ai l'impression d'être incompris
Pour toi, j'ai dû faire des sacrifices, toi, tu ne vois que les artifices
Mais je t'aime pour la vie
Tu me demandes pourquoi j'suis tout l'temps au studio, oh
Bah, pour quitter la hess et pour quitter la hess
Tu me demandes avec qui j'suis tout l'temps au studio
Bah, le J c'est le S, ouais, le J c'est le S

[Couplet 4 : Naps]
Et j'voulais te dire ce que j'ressens (okay)
Quand j'étais mal, quand tu m'disais qu't'avais pas trop le temps (okay)
Dis-moi qu'est ce tu deviens, qu'est ce tu racontes ? Ça fait longtemps
T'as beau leur faire du bien, poto, ils sont jamais contents (okay, okay)
J'suis dans l'bolide, j'suis dans le Kompressor, j'pense à toi, insh'Allah tu t'en sors
J'vais la récupère vers, la Valentine elle vient de finir son sport
Des fois j'suis en tort (okay), j'gamberge dans le Porsche
Dès fois elle m'cherche, elle veut que j'la sorte

[Couplet 5 : Lynda]
J'ai bien compris qu'le love et moi c'était mort
J'ai tout donné, donné mais j'ai raté le coche
Que des paroles et moi j'veux changer d'décor (que des paroles)
L'amour n'existe plus, comme la parole d'un homme
Hmm, plus de sentiments, bébé, si tu reviens, même si tu le fais gentiment, eh
Tu n'avais pas de concurrent, mais toi tu changes, donc met toi sur le banc, eh, oh, oh, oh
Plus de sentiments, bébé, même si tu reviens, si tu le fais gentiment, eh
Tu n'avais pas de concurrent, non, non, non, non, pas de concurrent, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Couplet 6 : SAF]
J'monte dans le Viano, j'y vais piano
J'reçois : ""Ti amo"", j'crois qu'c'est mon bébé
C'est moi, pas un autre, qui s'est battu pour nous, j'peux pas voir un autre t'appeler : ""Mon bébé""
Et j'ai les mains propres, t'inquiètes, mon bébé, j'aime trop quand tu m'appelles : ""Habibi""
Pour toi j'ai arrêté habiba, et j'suis dans les streams, plus la bibi
Trop dingue, plus de mots
J'veux de toi mi reina, pour toi j'assassine, facile

[Couplet 7 : Thabiti]
Tout pour la mille-fa (lala, la, lala, lala), un jour on s'en ira
Le chemin est parsemé d'embûches mais j'garde la foi (mais j'garde la foi)
J'veux acheter un pavtar sur la Costa Azurra (Azurra)
Quand j'fais rentrer les mapessas, j'le fais pour toi",False,False,46209254.0,folk music

LYRICS:
We used to be 
The life of the party
Body to body
Dance the night away
Shoot tequila straight
 
Obsessed with each other
And down for another 
Round until last call
Wasn’t alcohol 

Keeping us up ‘til the sun came around
Thought we’d stay drunk forever, but now

You’re the reason there’s no whiskey anywhere inside this house
You’re the reason all my friends know I don’t go downtown
You’re the reason I hate champagne, never used to turn it down
You’re the only thing I want when one drop hits my mouth
But baby, you’re the reason
I quit drinking

We used to be
Dizzy all morning
Hungover, pouring 
Cups of coffee black
Kiss and crawl right back

Under the covers
Down for another 
Hour in that bed
Now, I’m here instead

Waking up sober, it feels kind of nice
Except that I can’t sleep at night

You’re the reason there’s no whiskey anywhere inside this house
You’re the reason all my friends know I don’t go downtown
You’re the reason I hate champagne, never used to turn it down
You’re the only thing I want when one drop hits my mouth
Baby, you’re the reason
I quit drinking

I quit thinking (I quit thinking)
Staring at the ceiling (Ohh)
And all my cabernet is down the kitchen sink, yeah (It’s down the kitchen sink, yeah)
I quit mixing (I quit mixing)
All my drinks and feelings
It’s not fixing that you’re gone

You’re the reason there’s no whiskey anywhere inside this house
You’re the reason all my friends know I don’t go downtown
You’re the reason I hate champagne, never used to turn it down
You’re the only thing I want when one drop hits my mouth
Baby, you’re the reason
Ohh, you’re the reason
I quit drinking

Lyrics:

VERSE:
I'll tell you a story 
Before it tells itself 
I'll lay out all my reasons
You'll say that I need help

We all have expectations 
And sometimes they go wrong
No one listens to me 
So I put it in this song

CHORUS:
They tell me think with my head
Not that thing in my chest 
Got their hands at my neck this time

But you're the one that I want
If that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

VERSE:
Ill tell them a story
They'll sit and nod their heads
If tell you my secrets
will you go tell your friends 

Hold on to your opinions
Stand by what you said
In the end it's my decision
So it's my fault when it ends

CHORUS:
They tell me think with my head
Not that thing in my chest 
Got their hands at my neck this time

But you're the one that I want
If that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

LYRICS:
Half of my high school got too drunk
Half of my high school fell in love
With the girl next door
In their daddy’s Ford
Half of my main street’s mini skirts
Half of my main street’s dressed for church
It could use some rain
And a fresh coat of paint
 
Half of my hometown’s still hangin’ around
Still talkin’ about that one touchdown
They’re still wearin’ red and black
Go Bobcats, while the other half
Of my hometown, they all got out
Some went north
Some went south
Still lookin’ for a feelin’ half of us ain’t found
So stay or leave
Part of me will always be
Half of my hometown
 
Half of our prom queens cut their hair
Half of them think that it ain’t fair
The quarterback moved away and never came back
Half of my family is happy I left
The other half worries I’ll just forget
Where I came from
Same place where they came from
 
Half of my hometown’s still hangin’ around
Still talkin’ about that one touchdown
They’re still wearin’ red and black
Go Bobcats, while the other half
Of my hometown, they all got out
Some went north
Some went south
Still lookin’ for a feelin’ half of us ain’t found
So stay or leave
Part of me will always be
Half of my hometown
Half of my hometown
 
Back roads raise us
Highways they take us
Memories make us want to go back
 
To our hometown, settle down
Talk about that one touchdown
Raise some kids in red and black
Go Bobcats, while the other half
Of my hometown was in the crowd
They knew the words
They sang them loud
And all I wanna do is make them proud
‘Cause half of me will always be
Knoxville, Tennessee
My hometown
My hometown

Lyrics:
I was kind, I was warm, I was patient
All the nights that you cried when you're wasted
Hold your hand, rub your chest when you're anxious

Helped you with the career you were making
Look at you, you're a star, I'm the reason
That you're more confident, motivated

And honestly, your new girlfriend should thank me
For how it all worked out
I guess you're all grown up now

Do you think of me when you fuck her?
Do you use the moves, the ones we learned?
It's always the next person
That gets the better version

'Cause baby, I loved you at your worst
And I fixed your heart, but mine still hurts
And now some other person
Is gonna get the better version of you, of you

i was there on the side of your stages
i grew up for our difference in ages
never thought we were subject to changes

i did my best to fix it
‘til death cuz then i meant it
Your next girl is gonna get you reinvented and not pretending 

Do you think of me when you fuck her?
Do you use the moves, the ones we learned?
It's always the next person
That gets the better version

'Cause baby, I loved you at you worst
And I fixed your heart, but mine still hurts
And now some other person
Is gonna get the better version of you
Of you, of you, of you

You were kind, you were warm, you were patient
Helped me with the career I was making
Look at me, I'm a star, you're the reason

And I think of you when I fuck her
I use the moves, the ones we learned
It's always the next person
That gets the better version

'Cause baby, you loved me at my worst
And you fixed my heart, but the thing that hurts
Is now some other person
Is gonna get the better version

And now some other person
Is gonna get the better version of me

Lyrics: 
The smile, the charm, the words, the spark Everything you had it | guess I had a naive heart | ‘Cause boy, I let you have it, you said I was your only | Never thought you’d leave me lonely | You’re just a lost boy With your head up in the clouds | You’re just a lost boy Never keep your feet on the ground

// Always gonna fly away Just because you know you can | Never gonna learn there’s No such place as Neverland
You don’t understand | you’ll never grow up | You’re never gonna be a man | Peter Pan //

Deep down I knew that you were too good to be true | But every piece and part of me wanted to believe in you | Now it’s happily ever never, I guess now I know better | You’re just a lost boy With your head up in the clouds | You’re just a lost boy Never keep your feet on the ground

you’re just a lost boy | yeah, I know who you are | you’re just a lost boy | you’re too busy chasing stars

LYRICS:
It ain't my fault
So don't blame me
I swear I just came here to unwind and have one drink
The way it looks
Ain't what you think
This cabernet has a way of vanishin' on me

There's a hole in the bottle
Leakin' all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even suppertime
Honey no I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine

I keep my cool
Play by all the rules
I swear ten minutes ago that bottle was full
I won't cry
About love gone wrong
Cause tears would water down this ruby red I'm sippin' on

There's a hole in the bottle
Leakin' all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even suppertime
Honey no I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine

I went and got a new one
Cause the other one was broken
Now this one's halfway gone
And it's barely even open

There's a hole in the bottle
Leakin' all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even suppertime
Honey no I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine

You may ask me where it's goin'
But I can't even find
The hole in the bottle of wine

LYRICS:
I retired my red lipstick cause you said you didn't like it
I didn't wear my high heel shoes
Cause I couldn't be taller than you
I didn't want to lose my friends but now it's hard to even find em
It's what you wanted, ain't it
It's what you wanted

I thought I'd miss you
When it ended
I thought it'd hurt me
But it didn't
I thought I'd miss you
I thought I'd miss you

But I miss me more
I miss my own beat
To my own snare drum
I miss me more
I miss my own sheets
In the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams
I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before
I ever kissed you
Yeah I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more
I miss me more

I put on my old records that I hid in the back of the closet
And I turned them up to ten
And then I played them all again
I found my independence can't believe I ever lost it
It's what you wanted, ain't it
It's what you wanted

I thought I'd miss you
When it ended
I thought it'd hurt me
But it didn't
I thought I'd miss you
Yeah I thought I'd miss you 

But I miss me more
I miss my own beat
To my own snare drum
I miss me more
I miss my own sheets
In the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams
I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before
I ever kissed you
Yeah I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more
I miss me more

I thought I'd miss you
I thought it'd hurt me
And I'd want to kiss you
I thought I'd miss you

But I miss me more
I miss my own beat
To my own snare drum
I miss me more
I miss my own sheets
In the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams
I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before
I ever kissed you
And I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more
I miss me more
I miss me more
I miss me more

Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Here we go, here we go
It's about time that we set it off
Here we go, here we go
Red lights, I could never stop
A dreamer with the fever to be great was all I ever want, was all I ever wanted
A finder with the fever for the fame was all I ever want, was all I ever wanted
Got me singin' like
Bang, bang
Bang, bang
Bang, bang
This fire's the weapon
Bang, bang
Bang, bang
Bang, bang
Won't stop till we're legend
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Won't stop till we're legend
Here we go, here we go
It's my turn to make history
Here we go, here we go
When I'm gone they'll remember me, yeah
A dreamer with the fever to be great was all I ever want, was all I ever wanted
A finder with the fever for the fame was all I ever want, was all I ever wanted
Got me singin' like
Bang, bang
Bang, bang
Bang, bang
This fire's the weapon
Bang, bang
Bang, bang
Bang, bang
Won't stop till we're legend
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Won't stop till we're legend
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Won't stop till we're legend
Blood, sweat, I'll break my bones
Till all my scars bleed golden
My name's forever known
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Blood, sweat, I'll break my bones
Till all my scars bleed golden
My name's forever known
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Blood, sweat, I'll break my bones (bang bang, bang, bang)
Till all my scars bleed golden
My name's forever known (bang bang, bang bang, bang bang, won't stop till we're legend)
Bang, bang, won't stop till we're legend
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Won't stop till we're legend
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah

“Stronger” Lyrics:

I don't do this for the riches
I'm infected, my condition is I'm always in my head
These words are my religion,
I'm obsessed it's by decision
I'ma do this til I'm dead

Set me on fire, set me on, set me on fire
Whoa whoa
I'm still alive, I'm still a, I'm still alive
Whoa, whoa-bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

Higher, faster, ever lasting
Harder, faster, ever never crashing

Stronger, bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

I do this with conviction
I write truths and never fiction
My disease is what you fed
I can't stop with my ambition
Like a missile on a mission
I'm a force that you will dread

Stronger, stronger, ever lasting
Higher, faster, never crashing
