Song : Swimming Pools feat August Alsina 
Album: The Playboy Diaries

I'm way past gone, and I just see the bottom of this bottle
I just woke up to a room full of models
Who know that I ain't calling them tomorrow
It's been so long, since I have been on this level right here
Waking up, after I passd out, I put my clothes on, before I mash out
Cause I been losing my mind, wasting my time
Fucking these hoes and sipping this wine
Skipping the line to get in the side
Playin the bottle n feeding them lies
Shawty say she need a ride
I tell her cool and get ready to slide
Into my room, I hit her from behind
Doing again like I'm pressing rewind

Cause I ain't never babysitting, I been lining up shots
I'm a show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you diiive in it
Swimming pool full of liquor, then you diiive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch them all pop
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they diiive in it
Pool full of liquor I'm a diiive in it, ohh

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

I'm way past gone, from the partying n bullshit
Don't remember where I'm at, in a room full of bitches
Music playing in the back
Damn, time for me to get gone
Cause I ain't supposed to be here
Feeling faded, I'm so intoxicated
And your girl, say she feeling X rated
I'm gone cause I been
Losing my mind, wasting my time
Fucking these hoes and sipping this wine
Skipping the line to get in aside
Biting the bottle n feeding them lies
Shawty say she need a ride
I tell her cool and get ready to slide
Into my room, I hit her from behind
Doing again like I'm pressing rewind

Cause I have never babysitting, I be lining up shots
I'm a show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you diiive in it
Swimming pool full of liquor, then you diiive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they diiive in it
Pool full of liquor I'm a diiiive in iit

Montags früh wacht man irgendwo auf und versucht zu rekonstruieren, was letzte Nacht passiert ist.
Die letzte Nacht? Das war Freitag!
Die längste Nacht der Woche hat jetzt einen eigenen Soundtrack! Die Nacht von Freitag auf Montag!
Das Erfolgsduo SDP hat sich dazu entschlossen, dem vielversprechenden Nachwuchskünstler SIDO erneut unter die Arme zu greifen und gemeinsam haben die Berliner den Song des Jahres fabriziert! Animations-Genie Alexander Gellner hat die drei Ausnahmekünstler beim Feiern mit der Kamera begleitet und ein fesselndes Doku-Musikvideo-Drama gezaubert, das in Deutschland seines gleichen sucht! 
Anspruchsvoll, aber unterhaltsam, zeigt das Werk die Gefahren des sogenannten „Party machens"" und darf so als pädagogisch besonders Wertvoll gelten.
Die Nacht von Freitag auf Montag! Ein packendes Zeugnis Berliner Feierkultur!
Die zweite Single des Neuen Albums von SDP verlässt dein Ohr nie wieder.

📖 Letra:
Tiempo 1,2,3 y…

Tu amor es como una canción
Mi corazón un pentagrama
En donde tu interpretación 
Fue en base a cuánto tú me amas 
La vida me trajo acordes graves 
Y esa canción tú te la sabes

Yo no sé si en Do o en RE o en MI
O arranco en FA para que tu SOL me alumbre
Mi vida será LA que tú quieras
La que tú prefieras
Aunque no siempre respondas con SI

Yo no sé si en Do o en RE o en MI
O arranco en FA para que tu SOL me alumbre
Mi vida será LA que tú quieras
La que tú prefieras
Aunque no siempre respondas con SI 
Mi canción 

Tiempo 1,2,3 y…

Tomé mi cruz como instrumento
Aunque me pierda en el solfeo
Y sobre todos en los silencios 
Cuando no entiendo lo que veo
La vida me trajo acordes graves
Y esa canción tú te la sabes 

Yo no sé si en Do o en RE o en MI
O arranco en FA para que tu SOL me alumbre
Mi vida será LA que tú quieras
La que tú prefieras
Aunque no siempre respondas con SI 

Yo no sé si en Do o en RE o en MI
O arranco en FA para que tu SOL me alumbre
Mi vida será LA que tú quieras
La que tú prefieras
Aunque no siempre respondas con SI 

Contigo tengo vida llena de armonía
Que cubren el vacío y la necesidad 
Y tus palabras son amor y melodía
Llenas de luz, llenas de paz y de verdad
LA que tú quieras, la que tú prefieras
Aunque no siempre respondas con SI 
Mi canción 

Te amo Dios
Tu amor es como una canción
Escrita por ti
En mi corazón

De la A a la Z, Alex Zurdo
3,2,1 y… se acabo

📝 Letra:

Cuánto me bendice 
Tu amor sin condición 
Aún con todo lo que hice 
Tu gracia me arropó 

Y cambiaste mi corazón 
Viniste a tomar control 
De todos mis pasos 
Hoy tengo tu abrazo 

Cambiaste mi corazón 
Viniste a tomar control 
De todos mis pasos 

Ya no vivo yo 
Solo Tú, Tú en mí 
Ya no vive aquel por el cual yo sufrí 

Ya no vivo yo 
Solo Tú, Tú en mí 
Yo tomé la cruz, te miré y te seguí 

Y preparas la mesa 
Delante de todo lo que siempre me quiso herir 
Me sientas en ella 
No importa si fui de lo menospreciado y lo vil 

No miras de dónde vengo 
Cambiaste mi rumbo 
Cambiaste mi mente, mi vida 
Cambiaste mi mundo

Y cambiaste mi corazón 
Viniste a tomar control 
De todos mis pasos 
Hoy tengo tu abrazo 

Cambiaste mi corazón 
Viniste a tomar control 
De todos mis pasos 

Ya no vivo yo 
Solo Tú, Tú en mí 
Ya no vive aquel por el cual yo sufrí 

Ya no vivo yo 
Solo Tú, Tú en mí 
Yo tomé la cruz, te miré y te seguí 

Mis manos quedaron limpias 
Y mi corazón es puro 
Sin falsedad y sin engaño 
Camino contigo seguro 

Guárdame y líbrame 
Y jamás seré avergonzado 
Mi aflicción ya se fue 
Todo lo has cambiado 

(De todos mis pasos) 
(Cambiaste mi corazón) 
(De todos mis pasos) 

Y cambiaste mi corazón 
Viniste a tomar control 
De todos mis pasos 
Hoy tengo tu abrazo 

Cambiaste mi corazón 
Viniste a tomar control 
De todos mis pasos 

Ya no vivo yo 
Solo Tú, Tú en mí 
Ya no vive aquel por el cual yo sufrí 

Ya no vivo yo 
Solo Tú, Tú en mí 
Yo tomé la cruz, te miré y te seguí

Letra:
[Indiomar]
Aun no soy lo que tú quieres 
Y se que me amas igual
Pero la obra va por donde debe
Tu la vas a completar

Y aunque yo perfecto no soy
Estoy donde él quiere que esté

Porque a pesar de mí siempre tu estarás
Yo soy para ti, no me soltaras
Y aunque yo perfecto no soy
Estoy donde él quiere que esté

[Un Corazón]
No siempre hago lo que quiero
No lo puedo comprender
La razón porque prefiero
Lo que no debo de hacer

Aún asi me amas
Aunque aveces me tropiece
En tus brazos yo me rendiré
Siempre seguiré tu luz
//Quiero corresponder a tu amor//

Y a pesar de mí siempre tu estarás
Yo soy para ti no me soltaras

Y aunque yo perfecto no soy
Estoy donde él quiere que esté

[Funky]
Y a pesar de como he sido
Siempre tú me has bendecido
Y yo vivo convencido
Que no hay nadie como tú Jesús

Yo tome mi cruz fue para seguirte
Para cantarte y decirte
Gracias por lo que hiciste
Aunque mis actos suelen herirte
De mi lado no quieres irte

Entonces tú me buscas y me voy
Y me encuentras donde estoy
Tengo tu gracia hoy
A pesar de como soy

[Redimi2]
A pesar de mí tu sigues conmigo
Nunca me niegas el amparo de tu abrigo
Si caigo me levantas y yo prosigo
Quisiera comprender tu amor y no lo consigo

Por siempre te amaré lo que me pidas te daré
Por donde me lleves te seguiré
Tu sabes quien soy cuando nadie me ve
Sabes de mi corazon más de lo que yo se

Lo sé eres el estandarte
En tus manos soy una obra de arte
Nadie puede igualarte
Sencillamente eres clase aparte

Y a pesar de mí siempre tu estarás
Yo soy para ti, no me faltaras
Y aunque yo perfecto no soy
Estoy donde él quiere que esté

[Abby Valdez]
Yo no quiero que se apague
Este fallo que hay en mi interior
De mi corazon la llave te la doy

Porque tú, tú eres mi aire
Haz cambiado mi lamento en baile
//De tu mano no me soltaré//
De tu lado yo me quedare
//Y de aquí no me iré//

[Alex Zurdo]
Y a pesar de las fallas
Tu amor no se calla
Ven fortalece mi agalla
Y si me subo al ring
Y no doy la talla
Nunca tiro la toalla

//Tu viste en mi lo que no veo
Me hiciste free cuando era un reo
Eres el sol donde bronceo
Mi alma y la paz que poseo//

Y a pesar de mí siempre tu estarás
Yo soy para ti, no me soltarás
Y aunque yo perfecto no soy
Estoy donde él quiere que esté

📝 Letra ""Cuando Yo Te Conocí"":

Siempre recuerdo aquel día en que Tú me encontraste
Esa experiencia que yo jamás olvidaré

Fue mejor que viajar por un bote en Miami
O como poco ganarme diez grammy´s
Mejor que sacarme una selfie en la torre en parís

Ni escalar la montaña más alta
Y mirar el mundo desde allí
Nada podrá compararse y lo quiero decir

Que cuando yo te conocí Dios
Algo en mi, en mi cambió
Cuando yo te conocí Dios
No entendí lo que, lo que pasó
Pero pasó, cuando yo te conocí

Y desde entonces solo yo he querido cantarte
Y dedicarme a vivir exclusivo pa´ ti

Se siente mejor que andar en un bugatti
O que viajar a marte desde aquí
Nada podrá compararse y lo quiero decir 

Que cuando yo te conocí Dios
Algo en mi, en mi cambió
Cuando yo te conocí Dios
No entendí lo que, lo que pasó
Pero pasó, cuando yo te conocí

Y yo me disfruto en cada rincón 
Desde mi casa hasta Hong-Kong
De Ti me habla tu creación 
Llegando a mi corazón 

Todo lo que hiciste es bueno
Lo se desde que nací
Pero cuando yo te conocí

Cuando yo te conocí Dios
Algo en mi, en mi cambió
Cuando yo te conocí Dios
No entendí lo que, lo que pasó
Pero pasó, cuando yo te conocí

Cuando yo te conocí Dios
Algo en mi, en mi cambió
Cuando yo te conocí Dios
No entendí lo que, lo que pasó
Pero pasó, cuando yo te conocí

📝 Letra:

Dime que fue lo que viste en mí, que yo no lo pude ver
Y quizá nadie lo sabe, solamente tú lo sabes
Y si lo sabes yo también quiero saber
¿Qué hice pa´ ser amado?
¿Qué viste en mi corazón?
Mi vida la cautivaste, Divino Dios

¡Y yo!
//Sin ti nada soy
Sin ti ¿a dónde voy?
Sin ti no hay vida
Te conocí por eso ¡yo! //

No entiendo si todo me descalificaba, si no eras tú lo que yo pensaba
Y aun así me abrazaste, Tú me salvaste y aquí estoy
Contándole y diciéndole al mundo, que fui sacado de lo más profundo
Que por tu camino me quedo y no retrocedo.

Y es que no puedo (no puedo) imaginarme un mundo sin Tu favor
Y es que yo no quiero (no quiero) dejar de cantar Tu gran amor
No puedo (no puedo), pues no tendría a donde ir
Yo me refugio en tus brazos y que lo sepa el mundo
Sin ti no quiero vivir.

¡Y yo!
//Sin ti nada soy
Sin ti ¿a dónde voy?
Sin ti no hay vida
Te conocí por eso ¡yo! //

Yo decidí tomar la cruz y abrazarla fuerte
Yo decidí seguirte por cantarte y por creerte
Si puedo sentirte, aunque no pueda verte
Vivir por fe y no vivir por suerte
Y es que, no importa que me vituperen
Que por mí se alteren, pero no detienen
La obra que haces en mí, por eso no vivo sin ti

Y es que no puedo (no puedo) imaginarme un mundo sin Tu favor
Y es que yo no quiero (no quiero) dejar de cantar Tu gran amor
No puedo (no puedo), pues no tendría a donde ir
Yo me refugio en tus brazos y que lo sepa el mundo

Letra:
Yo no le envidio nada al mundo
En mi corazón no cabe
Tengo otro gusto más rotundo
Y sólo Dios lo sabe

Ni Gucci, ni Prada, ni unos Balenciaga
Me van a cambiar el mood
Que no es lo que gaste ni lo que yo haga
Sin eso me siento good, por eso

//Me quité y cambié mi perfil
Al pecado bloqueé yo no lo vo’a seguir//

Me quité, de aquella vida me quité (adiós)
Y a aquél camino dije bye, bye, bye
//Hasta nunca dije bye, bye, bye//
Hasta nunca

Imagínate un pozo peligroso
Y dicho pozo dentro de un calabozo
De ahí me sacaron soy más que dichoso
Jesús pagó la fianza y fue muy costoso

De vida vergonzosa a vida victoriosa
Imperfecta pero maravillosa
Estoy hasta buen mozo… mira qué cosa
Bueno por lo menos eso piensa mi esposa

Al día y no fue que me saqué la lotería
Cristo es la razón de mi alegría
Tengo gozo poderoso con eterna batería
Gozo que el mundo nunca me daría

El mundo no me lo dio
////Y como no me lo dio no me lo puede quitar////

Ni Gucci, ni Prada, ni unos Balenciaga
Me van a cambiar el mood
Que no es lo que gaste ni lo que yo haga
Sin eso me siento good, por eso

//Me quité y cambié mi perfil
Al pecado bloqueé yo no lo vo’a seguir//

Me quité, de aquella vida me quité (adiós)
Y a aquél camino dije bye, bye, bye
//Hasta nunca dije bye, bye, bye//
Hasta nunca

Definitivo ahora sí me siento vivo
Lo negativo no se ve atractivo
Como te lo describo, solo sé que ´tamos activo y positivo
A mí me perdonaron y borraron el archivo

Algo nuevo en mi vida se manifiesta
Ahora fue que comenzó la fiesta
No hay propuesta del mundo que suene cool
Solo con Dios y mi familia me siento full

Me, me, me, me quité, mi pasado se quedó en un TBT
Para allá no volveré
Me, me, me, me quité, transformado de la cabeza a los pies

Esto sí que es vida, lo gritaré
Esto sí que es vida, lo viviré
Esto sí que es vida, lo cantaré
Me, me yo me quité

Ni Gucci, ni Prada, ni unos Balenciaga
Me van a cambiar el mood
Que no es lo que gaste ni lo que yo haga
Sin eso me siento good, por eso

//Me quité y cambié mi perfil

📝 Letra de ""Te Busco"": 

Tú me sanaste el corazón
Tu sacrificio me dio vida
Tú eliminaste mi dolor
Por una vida bendecida

Y por eso te busco y te amo y me amas
Por siempre, la cruz fue suficiente
Por eso te busco y te amo y me amas
Por siempre, la cruz fue suficiente

Yo soy la evidencia de aquel amor
Que soporto en una cruz el dolor
Evidencia porque soy la prueba
De una sangre que trae una vida nueva

Mi padre, mi amigo, también mi Dios
Solo tu nombre pronunciará mi voz
El que me guarda cuando pase por fuego
Me perdonaste y todo lo hiciste nuevo

Tú me abrazaste con brazos de amor
Y me llenaste el corazón vació
No fue tan grande al parecer mi error
Que todavía estás al lado mío

Y conmigo aquí en mi interior
Guiándome por el camino
La cruz fue la prueba de amor
Que cambió mi destino

Y por eso te busco y te amo y me amas
Por siempre, la cruz fue suficiente
Por eso te busco y te amo y me amas
Por siempre, la cruz fue suficiente

Te buscare, te seguiré
No me avergonzaré
De amarte y rendirme
A tus pies, a tus pies

Tú me sanaste el corazón
Tu sacrificio me dio vida
Tú eliminaste mi dolor
Por una vida bendecida

Y por eso te busco y te amo y me amas
Por siempre, la cruz fue suficiente
Por eso te busco y te amo y me amas
Por siempre, la cruz fue suficiente
Hey, de la A a la Z

📝 Letra:
Hoy recibí una llamada
De esas de antes pa' hacerme una invitación
Como no lograron nada
Pues se molestan cuando yo 
Mantengo mi posición 
Y entonces 

¿Pa’ que preguntan?, si me conocen
Aquí no hay vida socio
Después de las doce
¿Pa’ que preguntan?, si esto no es juego
Yo se los dije ya
//Que soy un hombre nuevo//
No ando de aquí pa' llá de allá pa' cá
Que soy un hombre nuevo

Trae un par de toallas
Vamo pa' la playa 
Sol, arena, leche y miel
Y sin medalla
Siempre hay uno 
Que quiere pasarse de la raya
Pero no van a derribar esta muralla 
Ya yo no busco lo que ustedes buscan
Ya no me junto pa' lo que ustedes se juntan 
Las cosas viejas a mi vida no se ajustan 
Si saben que lo que conmigo ¿pa’ qué preguntan?

Yes mi pasado se quedó 
En el erase una vez
Te me vas con tu propuesta en 
Uno, dos, tres
Conmigo eviten el estrés 
Si ya me conocen pues.

¿Pa’ que preguntan?, si me conocen
Aquí no hay vida socio
Después de las doce
¿Pa’ que preguntan?, si esto no es juego
Yo se los dije ya
//Que soy un hombre nuevo//
No ando de aquí pa' llá de allá pa' cá
Que soy un hombre nuevo

Las cosas viejas ya pasaron
O es que tú quieres que yo vuelva 
A las fiestas que me tumbaron 
Hacen leña si se cae el palo
Y aunque se vistan de reyes 
Yo no quiero sus regalos
Ir pa' la calle eso no es malo
Todo es lícito, pero no todo conviene dijo Pablo
Para que yo me salvara el soportó los clavos
¿Tú quieres que me ensucie después que me lavo?
Mmmm que mal negocio socio
Y las malas decisiones las tomé en el mundo
Líbrame de labios inmundos
Que los virus se contagian en segundos.

Son dos o tres los conté
Tenía una par de panas
Y ahora ninguno se ve 
Que no es por falta de tiempo
Es falta de interés 
No cuenten conmigo otra vez

Mejor vamos pa' la playa
Tráete un par de toallas 
Con el sol la arena, ¡te dije que no!
Si ustedes saben cómo soy
Y entonces.

¿Pa' que preguntan?, si me conocen
Aquí no hay vida socio
Después de las doce
¿Pa' que preguntan?, si esto no es juego
Yo se los dije ya
//Que soy un hombre nuevo//
No ando de aquí pa' llá de allá pa' cá
Que soy un hombre nuevo

Y perdona si te aflijo
Se tenía que decir y se dijo
Y ahora vivo como hijo
Se tenía que decir y se dijo

Que soy un hombre nuevo
No ando de aquí pa' llá de allá pa' cá
Que soy un hombre nuevo",True,True,12072442.0,Not Found

📖 Letra ""Pentagrama (Remix):

Tiempo
Un, dos, tres, y

Tu amor es como una canción
Mi corazón un pentagrama
En donde Tu interpretación
Fue en base a cuanto Tú me amas
La vida me trajo acordes graves
Y esa canción Tú te la sabes

Yo no sé si en Do
O en Re, o en Mi
O arranco en Fa
Para que Tu sol me alumbre
Mi vida será la que Tú quieras
La que Tú prefiera
Aunque no siempre respondas con Si

Yo no sé si en Do
O en Re, o en Mi
O arranco en Fa
Para que Tu sol me alumbre
Mi vida será la que Tú quieras
La que Tu prefiera
Aunque no siempre respondas con Si
Mi canción
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
He-he

Tiempo, un, dos, tres y
Aunque el temor me haya asustado
Me he sostenido de tu mano 
Y si el solfeo yo no entiendo
Yo escucharé de tu cifrado
La vida me trajo acordes graves
Y esa canción Tú te la sabes

Yo no sé si en Do
O en Re, o en Mi
O arranco en Fa
Para que Tu sol me alumbre
Mi vida será la que Tú quieras
La que Tú prefiera
Aunque no siempre respondas con Si

Yo no sé si en Do
O en Re, o en Mi
O arranco en Fa
Para que Tu sol me alumbre
Mi vida será la que Tú quieras
La que Tú prefiera
Aunque no siempre respondas con Si

Contigo tengo vida llena de armonía
Que cubren el vacío y la necesidad
Y Tus palabras son amor y melodía
Llenas de luz, llenas de paz y de verdad
La que Tú quieras, la que Tú prefieras
Aunque no siempre respondas con Si
Mi canción

Te amo Dios
Tu amor es como una canción
Escrita por Ti
Ha-ha
En mi corazón
Alex al cuadrado
Alex Campos 
Tres, dos, uno, y
Se acabó

Letra:
[Alex Zurdo]
El uno venció al adversario
Por eso ya andamos con calma
En uno aunque somos varios
Y vamo´ apuntando a las almas

Uno murió y uno resucitó
Uno me sacó del lodo
Uno salvó, uno hasta el fin
Y uno somos todos

(Coro)
Pa´l que crea de rodillas
Es que se ganan las peleas
Con la verdad que los baquea
Pa´l que crea de rodillas
Es que se ganan las peleas
Y con un Dios que nos rodea

Rapero pero me congrego
Y como Sadrac, Mesac y Abed-Nego
Ante estatuas yo no me doblego
Aprendí que la verdad se cae encima
Esta el horno de fuego y que me quemen
Pero mi convicción yo no la niego

Tengo el cielo de cuenta de ahorro
Con ayuno y oración por si toca suplicar socorro
Ando con Alex Z como la del zorro
Redimi2 y Funky pa gritar a Cristo por todo chichorro

Quédense peleando con el viento
Que aquí lo que existe es unión
Como Gedeón con los trescientos
Es mi trabajo dar conocimiento
Que cuando Cristo venga va a temblar
La tierra con to´ los cimientos

Aquí la envidia se cancela
Y no hay cabida pa que el diablo venga entre teja y tela
Lloramos por Anuel por Cosculluela
Yo no tengo enemigos oculto
Sí, yo oro y Dios me los rebela

[Ander Bock]
Dios hizo que deje de llorar 
Por eso mi alma tiene enamora
Y predicando al que tiene la mirada colora
En el cielo mi morada Cristo tiene decorá
Por eso no leo el corán yo prefiero la torá

Cristo viene, Cristo reina solo Cristo el centro
Su manto me cubre cuando salgo y cuando entro
El respeto esta ganado solo en Cristo me concentro
Yo no soy María pero tengo a Cristo adentro

Cachi aunque no vista Gucci ni Versace
Porque pa ganar tu alma me visto hasta de mariachi
El diablo es un demonio recoja su cachibachi
Cristo ama al que hace buche pero también al de cachi

Legalista yo sé que no le va a gusta la pista
Pero yo le hablo a tu espíritu porque soy un salmista
Sigo rimando y más el diablo se contrista
Porque se dirá mi nombre cuando allá se pase lista

[Alex Zurdo]
(Coro)

No tengo guerra contra sangre ni carne
Oro pa´ crucificar la carne
No tengo que pedirle al diablo lo que Cristo quiere darme
To´a la protección sin que me arme

Esto es locura pal que se pierde, pierde
Caminando derecho sin que me izquierde
Dicen que el espíritu en todo discierne
Y el que esta ciego el jueves no cree que se puede morir viernes

No solo de pan vive el hombre
Solo a Dios se adora no tentarás al eterno
Solo tres contestación en el desierto
Pa’ que to´ se arrepienta esté cubierto

La vida es un restaurante paga por lo que te comiste
No quieres creer porque siervo
No has ido pa’ la iglesia
Ver al demonio saliendo de los cuerpos

[Alex Zurdo]
Zurdo pero derecho y con ganas de treparme en el techo
Pa’ decirle al mundo lo que Cristo ha hecho
Tengo en el plato el manjar de lo que hoy cosecho
Y les sirvo a to´ ustedes buen provecho

Solamente uno, uno que cambió el protocolo
Uno vino y a la muerte y pasó el reloj
Uno me dirige yo ya no controlo 
Y el pecado se fue pa la luna como apolo

Bien gracia cero desgracia por gracia
Pa´ tu dolor tengo farmacia
No ando en la cuerda floja de la vagancia
Pa´l chico las acrobacias

Es mejor que agua de mayo
Son las bendiciones si no fallo
La abue dice Dios somo tocayos
Sigo cosechando si mantengo el bien y no desmayo
Y no niego a Cristo aunque cante cien veces el gallo

(Coro)

[Redimi2]
Con un flow que no caduca
Redimi2 saca la bazuca
Bacalao disfrazao agárrate la peluca
Que venimos a rosear y no es con plomo
Dejándoles caer to´ el peso y no el de yomo

Beso de gloria fluye y Dios abrió la válvula
Que el evangelio no es una fábula
Te hablo de Cristo de Pablo y de Yiye Avila
Que me encontró haciendo un gallo bolo y me hizo águila

No estamos vacilando en este junte
Unidad sin uniformidad pa´l que se lo pregunte
El remanente anunciándole a la gente
Que el que no se arrepienta pa´l cielo que no se apunte

Establecer el reino es el desafío
Brillando sin envidiar las riquezas del impío
Ya papá Dios me dio lo mío
Pero no ronco porque el que ronca es porque está dormido

[Funky]
De mi salió virtud
Dijo Cristo a la multitud,
Yo te lo traje ven tócalo tu
Si te pregunta dónde esta Jesús
Esta en todos lados como anuncios en YouTube

Diles que su sangre pagó los piles
Y que somos uno aunque seamos miles
Que ya está a la vuelta así que te aconsejo que vigiles
Tú vas a cambiar, no vaciles

Tú sube y baja solo Dios encaja
Mete tu pasado en una caja
Satanás perdió Cristo es el dueño de la faja
La cruz fue su mejor baraja

Y yo no hablo de tiro
Sé cual es mi banda y no me viro
Soy la luz que no pueden ver los vampiros
Solo me inspiro a ser como Lebrón aspiro
Jugar con mis hijos antes del retiro

(Coro)

¿CÓMO HICE EL VIDEO?
Bueno éste video lo hice junto a mi hermana, con mi mejor amiga kelly y también con la ayuda de algunas youtubers con las que hablé para que me dejaran usar sus videos para este proyecto el cual fue unir nuestras voces como lo dice el coro de ésta canción: ""Uno mi voz al concierto de voces que cantan te quiero adorar"". y pues cada una me dio su país de origen para poner en el video a donde pertenecía cada una, tuve que esperar mucho tiempo porque no todas respondieron, pero bueno al fin aquí está el video espero lo disfruten y les sea de bendición.

LETRA
Si sabes dónde hallarlo
Si sabes dónde buscarlo
Llévame, necesito encontrarlo
Si sabes dónde pasea
Y lo que su alma desea
Cuéntame
Necesito escucharlo
No estará en un hermoso lugar
Con riquezas y grandezas
Tú no lo hallarás
No estará en donde piensas que está
Donde menos lo imaginas
Allí lo encontrarás
Si sabes con quién platica
Y en dónde pasa sus días
Llévame
Necesito encontrarlo
Si sabes con quién comparte
El pan y vino en la tarde
Cuéntame
Necesito escucharlo
Estará entre la gente al pasar
Entre niños y sonrisas allí tú lo verás
Lo hallarás en donde hay necesidad
Donde menos lo imaginas
Allí lo encontrarás
Ayer lo oí decir
Quien viene a mí no le echo fuera
Yo no le echo fuera
También lo oí decir
Soy el descaso que has buscado
Y la esperanza que has deseado
Me hallarás entre la gente al pasar
Entre niños y sonrisas allí tu me verás
Me hallarás en donde hay necesidad
Donde menos me imaginas
Allí me encontrarás
Donde menos lo imaginas
Allí lo encontrarás",True,True,22910858.0,Not Found

Lyrics:
I am unwritten, can't read my mind,
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand,
Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten

I break tradition, sometimes my tries
Are outside the line
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes,
But I can't live that way

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open

Lyrics
I got a pocket,
Got a pocketful of sunshine
I've got a love and I know that it's all mine
Oh, oh, oh
Do what you want,
But you're never gonna break me,
Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me
Oh, oh, oh

Take me away (take me away)
A secret place (a secret place)
A sweet escape (a sweet escape)
Take me away (take me away)
Take me away (take me away
To better days (to better days)
Take me away (take me away)
A hiding place (a hiding place)

I got a pocket,
Got a pocketful of sunshine
I've got a love and I know that it's all mine
Oh, oh, oh
Do what you want,
But you're never gonna break me,
Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me
Oh, oh, oh

I got pocket,
Got a pocketful of sunshine
I've got a love and I know that it's all mine
Oh, oh, oh

Wish that you could,
But you ain't gonna own me
Do anything you can to control me
Oh, oh, oh

Take me away (take me away)
A secret place (a secret place)
A sweet escape (a sweet escape)
Take me away (take me away)
Take me away (take me away
To better days (to better days)
Take me away (take me away)
A hiding place (a hiding place)

There's a place that I go
That nobody knows
Where the rivers flow
And I call it home
And there's no more lies
And the darkness is light
And nobody cries
There's only butterflies

Take me away (take me away)
A secret place (a secret place)
A sweet escape (a sweet escape)
Take me away (take me away)
Take me away (take me away
To better days (to better days)

Lyrics
These words are my own

Threw some chords together
The combination D-E-F
It's who I am, it's what I do
And I was gonna lay it down for you
I try to focus my attention
But I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration
But it's not coming easily

Trying to find the magic
Trying to write a classic
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know?

Waste-bin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own
From my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you

Read some Byron, Shelley and Keats
Recited it over a hip-hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean
With dead poets and drum machine

I know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find a killer hook
Now you've gone and raised the bar right up
Nothing I write is ever good enough

These words are my own
From my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you!

These words are my own
From my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you!

I'm getting off my stage
The curtains pull away
No hyperbole to hide behind
My naked soul exposes

Tryna find the magic
Tryna write a classic
Waste-bin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own
From my heart flow
Don't you know
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you!

These words are my own
From my heart flow
(They're from my heart.)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
(There's no better way.)
To better say
I love you, I love you!

These words are my own
They're from my heart
I love you, I love you!

That's all I got to say
Can't think of a better way
And that's all I've got to say
I love you. Is that okay?",True,True,110442210.0,pop music

Lyrics
Shake up the happiness
Wake up the happiness
It's christmas time

There's a story that I was told
I wanna tell the world before I get too old
And don't remember it, so let's December it
And reassemble it, oh yeah

Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness
And be on santa's magic list

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's christmas time

(Shake it up) X2
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's christmas time

At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be ok
And santa claus would hear him say:
I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And my family above
Can you send me some happiness
With my best to the rest of the people
Of the east and the west and
Maybe every once in a while
You can just give my Grandma a smile
It is the season to smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
Let me meet a boy one day
That wants to spread some love this way
And we can let our souls run free and
And He can open some happiness with me

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's christmas time

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's christmas time

I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where
Your boots have been
I am gonna show them
So they will know then
Your love will grow
And they believe again.

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's christmas time

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's christmas time

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's christmas time

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's christmas time

It's christmas time",True,True,31266678.0,pop music

Lyrics
[Natasha:]
Oh…
Never find a love like this
Oh…
Never find a love like this

We go back so far,
swinging in your back yard,
all the things that we used to do
We were cool back in high school
ooh I really liked you,
must have been your attitude.

[Chorus:]
That's why you keep on running
in and out of my mind.
As the years they'll roll by,
Baby, now I know why
I keep coming back to you.
You're the only one that knows me,
love it when you hold me,
never find a love like this
Let me hear you say
now I'll never be lonely,
look at what you've shown me,
never find a love like this

Well this life tried to keep us apart
you keep calling me back to your heart
Let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me,
wrap your world around me,
never find a love like this.

All the guys tried to take me,
you're the one who saved me,
I feel like I owe you my life.
And as strange as it may seem,
I'll go if you take me
I'm willing to sacrifice.

[Chorus]

'cause this life tried to keep us apart,
you keep calling me back to your heart.
Let me hear you say,
aren't you glad you found me,
wrap you all around me,
never find a love like this.

[Sean Kingston:]
May never find a love, love, love a love like this,
that still make me think about my middle school kiss.
I sit here in this chair and I wish
for you not to leave me now.
My friends they always told me
not to make you my wife,
man they was putting you down.
And now they see we rolling,
me and you, we strolling,
they don't wanna come around.

[Natasha:]
Let me hear you say,
you're the only one that knows me,
love it when you hold me,
never find a love like this.
Let me hear you say,
now I'll never be lonely,
look at what you've shown me,
never find a love like this.

When this life tries to keep us apart,
you keep calling me back to your heart.
Let me hear you say,
I'm so glad you found me,
wrap you all around me,
never find a love like this,

Oh… Never find a love like this…
When this life tried to keep us apart,
you keep calling me back to your heart,
Let me hear you say,
Oh… Never find a love like this.
Oh… Never find a love like this",True,True,40084435.0,pop music

Lyrics
Incompatible, it don't matter though
'cos someone's bound to hear my cry
Speak out if you do
You're not easy to find

Is it possible Mr. Loveable
Is already in my life?
Right in front of me
Or maybe you're in disguise

Who doesn't long for someone to hold
Who knows how to love you without being told
Somebody tell me why I'm on my own
If there's a soulmate for everyone

Here we are again, circles never end
How do I find the perfect fit
There's enough for everyone
But I'm still waiting in line

Who doesn't long for someone to hold
Who knows how to love you without being told
Somebody tell me why I'm on my own
If there's a soulmate for everyone

If there's a soulmate for everyone

Most relationships seem so transitory
They're all good but not the permanent one

Who doesn't long for someone to hold
Who knows how to love you without being told
Somebody tell me why I'm on my own
If there's a soulmate for everyone

Who doesn't long for someone to hold
Who knows how to love you without being told
Somebody tell me why I'm on my own
If there's a soulmate for everyone
If there's a soulmate for everyone",True,True,31432988.0,pop music

Lyrics
Ah yeah that's right
All you single people out there
This is for you

I'm not waitin' around for a man to save me
'Cause I'm happy where I am
Don't depend on a guy to validate me
No no
I don't need to be anyone's baby
Is that so hard to understand?
No I don't need another half to make me
Whole

Make your move if you want
Doesn't mean I will or won't
I'm free to make my mind up
You either got it or you don't

This is my current single status
My declaration of independence
There's no way I'm tradin' places
Right now a star's in the ascendant

I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be
(Right now)
I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be

That's right

Don't need to be on somebody's arm to look good
I like who I am
I'm not saying I don't wanna fall in love 'cause I would
I'm not gonna get hooked up just 'cause you say I should
Can't romance on demand
I'm gonna wait so I'm sorry if you misunderstood

That's right

This is my current single status
My declaration of independence
There's no way I'm tradin' places
Right now a star's in the ascendant

(Right now)
I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be
(Right now)
I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be
(Right now)
I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be
(Right now)
I'm single

Everything in its right time
Everything in its right place
I know I'll settle down one day
But 'til then I like it this way
It's my way
I like it this way

Make your move if you want
Doesn't mean I will or won't
I'm free to make my mind up
You either got it or you don't

'Til then I'm single

This is my current single status
My declaration of independence
There's no way I'm tradin' places
Right now a star's in the ascendant

This is my current single status
My declaration of independence
There's no way I'm tradin' places
Right now a star's in the ascendant

I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be
(Right now)
I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be
(Right now)

I'm single
(Right now)

✨No Cap Testo:-)
[Intro: Jake La Furia]
Do-Do-Do-Do-Don Joe
Jake

[Strofa 1: Jake La Furia]
Sono fresco (Ah)
C'ho ventiquattro carati appoggiati sul dress code
Quando esco (Yeah)
Faccio saltare le tipe, frate', come al Defqon
Abbiamo una versione per la legge
Bro, la tua galera a noi non ci corregge
Meglio vivere alla grande, fare il botto
E dopo fare il morto come ha fatto Heath Ledger
Faccio il rap, fra'
Mi cavalco quella supercar e quella super gyal
No cap, fra'
Ho soci in gabbia per il fumo e il crack, come Super Cat
Col jet, fra'
Voli privati dal quartiеre a Cartier, yeah
Bollе in testa, fra', Perrier, yeah
Le carni in bocca, bull terrier, yeah


[Pre-Ritornello: Geolier]
No cap, pe via 'e chisti sorde ormai nun saccio cchiù chi songo
No in base a chi tene 'o cash, no in base a chi conta
Nun è colpa mia si 'nme fido manco 'e ll'ombra
Pecché pure essa me lascia sulo si nun ce sta 'o sole

[Ritornello: Geolier]
M'addormo 'ncopp'ê sorde picciò faccio brutti suonne
Simmo schiave 'e nuje stesse, no 'e chello che circonda
Bitch vonno 'o nummero, sbirro vò l'impronta
'Nsaccio quanno aggi''a murì picciò m''a tengo pronto

[Strofa 2: Emis Killa]
Ah, lei mi grida che sono una bestia
E che non sono a posto di testa
Ma sono fresco, anche pieno di fresca
Quando entro nel posto i fra' escono di testa (Uoh)
Tu che fai il vero, ma non passi il test (Nah)
Porti una mask come il tipo di Tesla (Vroom)
Sembri Puff Daddy, ma non sei del giro (Nah)
Quando ti incontro, fra', giro la testa
Il mio era un sogno di strada
Volevo tutta la torta, non una portata
Ne ho una nel letto ed un'altra fuori dalla porta (Seh)
Entrambe fuori dalla tua portata (Ahahah)
Dopo che ho fatto nottata
Questi due sbirri mi fermano in strada
Ancora chiedono di chi è la macchina
Quant'è costata e come l'ho comprata, yeah (No cap)

[Pre-Ritornello: Geolier]
No cap, pe via 'e chisti sorde ormai nun saccio cchiù chi songo
No in base a chi tene 'o cash, no in base a chi conta
Nun è colpa mia si 'nme fido manco 'e ll'ombra
Pecché pure essa me lascia sulo si nun ce sta 'o sole

[Ritornello: Geolier]
M'addormo 'ncopp'ê sorde picciò faccio brutti suonne
Simmo schiave 'e nuje stesse, no 'e chello che circonda
Bitch vonno 'o nummero, sbirro vò l'impronta
'Nsaccio quanno aggi''a murì–

[Strofa 3: Geolier]
Yeah, tengo cchiù money ca probleme 'ncapa
E forse è chillo 'o problema cchiù grave
'A dignità è uguale â mugliera 'e nu frate
Nel senso ca chella 'nse tocca, ca è sacra
Baby, che vvuó da me?
Nun me può capì, ma t'assecondo
Mo che vvuó sapè?
'Ndesse 'a vita pe'tté pecché tu nun 'a disse pe'mmé
Guagliune senza patente 'int'ê supercar
Fummo p''o sfizio 'e sbuffà sempe annanze ê guardie
Sorry, papà, nun me dicere che sbaglio
Sî stato bravo, so' stato je a piglià 'sta strada


[Pre-Ritornello: Geolier]
No cap, pe via 'e chisti sorde ormai nun saccio cchiù chi songo
No in base a chi tene 'o cash, no in base a chi conta
Nun è colpa mia si 'nme fido manco 'e ll'ombra
Pecché pure essa me lascia sulo si nun ce sta 'o sole

[Ritornello: Geolier]
M'addormo 'ncopp'ê sorde, picciò faccio brutti suonne
Simmo schiave 'e nuje stesse, no 'e chello che circonda
Bitch vonno 'o nummero, sbirro vò l'impronta
'Nsaccio quanno aggi''a murì picciò m''a tengo pronto

Lyrics:
Lookin' in your eyes I see a paradise
This world that I found is too good to be true
Standin' here beside you
Want so much to give you this love in my heart
That I'm feelin' for you

Let 'em say we're crazy, I don't care 'bout that
Put your hand in my hand
Baby, don't ever look back
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Oh, whoa

I'm so glad I found you, I'm not gonna lose you
Whatever it takes I will stay here with you
Take it to the good times
See it through the bad times
Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do

Let 'em say we're crazy
What do they know?
Put your arms around me
Baby, don't ever let go
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us

Ooh, all that I need is you
All that I ever need
And all that I want to do
Is hold you forever and ever and ever, hey

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us, woah

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
(Nothing's gonna stop us now)
If this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
(Oh, no)

And we can build this dream together (Hey baby)
Standing strong forever (I know)
Nothing's gonna stop us now (Hey baby, nothing's gonna stop us)
If this world runs out of lovers (Hey baby, ooh)
We'll still have each other (Nothing's gonna)
Nothing's gonna stop us (Hey baby, nothing's gonna stop us now, yeah)
And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now

Lyrics:
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Say you don't know me
Or recognize my face
Say you don't care who goes
To that kind of place
Knee deep in the hoopla
Sinking in your fight
Too many runaways
Eating up the night

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Someone always playing
Corporation games
Who cares they're always changing
Corporation names
We just want to dance here
Someone stole the stage
They call us irresponsible
Write us off the page

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

It's just another Sunday
In a tired old street
Police have got the chokehold, oh
And we just lost the beat
Who counts the money
Underneath the bar
Who rides the wrecking ball
Into our guitars
Don't tell us you need us
'Cause we're the ship of fools
Looking for America
Coming through your schools

I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge
On another gorgeous sunny Saturday
And I'm seeing that bumper to bumper traffic
Don't you remember? ('Member, 'member)
It's your favorite radio station
In your favorite radio city
The city by the bay, the city that rocks
The city that never sleeps

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Built this city (Oo-ho)
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built, we built this city, yeah
(Built this city) We built, we built this city
We built, we built this city, yeah
(Built this city) We built, we built this city
We built, we built this city, yeah
(Built this city) We built, we built this city
We built, we built this city, yeah
(Built this city) We built, we built this city

Lyrics:
Go now
Don't look back
We've drawn the line
Move on
It's no good to go back in time

I'll never find another girl like you
For happy endings
It takes two
We're fire and ice
A dream won't come true

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewing in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes

Danger
In the game when the stakes are high
Branded
My heart was branded
While my senses stood by

I'll never find another girl like you
For happy endings
It takes two
We're fire and ice
A dream won't come true

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewing in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes
Sara, Sara
Storms are brewing in your eyes (oh)
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes

('Cause Sara)
Loved me
Like no one ever loved me before
(And Sara)
Hurt me
No one could ever hurt me more
(And Sara)
Sara
(And Sara)
Nobody loved me anymore

I'll never find another girl like you
No
We're fire and ice
A dream won't come true

Sara, Sara
No time is a good time, no

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewing in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes
Ooh
Sara, Sara
Storms are brewing in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time, no

Sara, Sara
Why did it?
Why did it?

Why did it all fall apart?

The new video for “Lights Out” by Grammy Award winning entertainer Estelle has premiered today. The sultry reggae track is off of her 2018 album Lovers Rock.

Directed by Estelle and Denzel Williams, the video was filmed in Australia and showcases Estelle in an intimate hotel room as she sings the song’s flirty lyrics. Filmed with sensual lighting and a decadent aesthetic, the visual perfectly matches the songs smooth and erotic vibe.

Prior to the release of “Lights Out”, Estelle recently completed the West Coast leg of her ‘Estelle Experience’ tour with dates in Las Vegas, Sacramento and Oakland following her East Coast run back in February where she hit New York, Philadelphia, DC, Atlanta and Nashville.

The Estelle Experience gave fans a chance to hear the story behind “Lovers Rock” from Estelle herself. Inspired by her parents love story, the album “Lovers Rock” features songs “Love Like Ours” featuring Tarrus Riley, “Better”, “Lights Out”, “Meet Up” featuring Maleek Berry, “So Easy” featuring Luke James and more.

“Lights Out” is my favorite song off the Lovers Rock album as I feel it truly embodies what Lovers Rock is to me,” said Estelle about the track. “The song came effortless to me and I love how it expresses the beauty in vulnerability and desire. 

On July 5th, Estelle will present Essence After Dark Dancehall & Afro Beats LinkUp at the 2019 New Orleans for Essence Music Festival. Estelle has partnered with Essence Fest to highlight artists from the worlds of Dancehall, Reggae, & Afro-Beat including Machel Montano, Spice, Wale, Kranium and more with music by Max Glazer and Shacia Marley. Using New Orleans as the backdrop, Estelle and Essence will merge fans of R&B, Hip Hop, & Soul with fans of Reggae and African music. 

Estelle will also keep busy this Spring/Summer with more shows and appearances including Dallas for Dallas Fan Expo, Atlanta for MomoCon Atlanta, UK for Shindig Fest, South Africa for the International Soweto Jazz Festival, Chicago for the Hyde Park Brewfest and New York for VP Records 40th Anniversary Concert at Summer Stage in Central Park on August 10th.

LYRICS
Tie back my hands
Take what you need
I’m at your command
So have mercy on me
I'll do what you want
Do as you please
I can’t take anymore
Won’t you come rescue me

Please set me on fire
Please set me on fire 
Please set me on fire
Please set me on fire 
I said Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Please set me on fire 
Please set me on fire

You can hold down my heart 
Lock it down tight
Cause it’s been so long 
Since i felt it ignite
Make my embers burn 
Where ash used to be
Cover me upIn your kerosene

Please set me on fire
Please set me on fire 
Please set me on fire
Please set me on fire 
I said Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Please set me on fire 
Please set me on fire

Cause I’ve been waiting here
For this spark to catch 
Come and burn it down 
Come and strike a match 
Cause I’ve been waiting here

Please set me on fire
Please set me on fire 
Please set me on fire
Please set me on fire 
I said Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Please set me on fire 
Please set me on fire

we're stuck where we are with no house, no car
castaways, ahoy, we are castaways

[verse: uniqua & pablo]
we were out at sea on a sailing ship
the rain began to rain and the wind began to whip
we felt the ship tip, it was going down
so we launched our lifeboat so we wouldn't drown

[chorus: all]
castaways, we are castaways
ahoy there, ahoy, we are castaways
on an island at sea

[break: uniqua, pablo & tyrone]
just me, me, and me

[chorus: all]
castaways, ahoy, we are castaways

Lyrics
Love, it has so many beautiful faces
Sharing lives and sharing days
My love it had so many empty spaces
I'm sharing a memory now
I hope that's how it stays

Now I'm deep inside love and still breathing
She is holding my heart in her hand
I'm the closest I've been to believing
This could be love forever

All throughout my life
The reasons I've demanded
But how can I reason
With the reason I'm a man

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh yeah
Hmm

In a minute I'm needing to hold her
In an hour I'm cold, cold as stone
When she leaves it gets harder and harder
To face life alone

Now my dreams are filled
With times when we're together
Guess what I need from her
Is forever love

Ooh, Ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, mm-mm-mm
Oh, oh, yeah
Now I feel forever love

Ooh, ooh
Oh yeah
Well I feel...

Una mushasha shula de Chihuahua
Me vendió una mashaca
Una mushasha shula de Chihuahua
Me vendió una mashaca

Me vendió una mashaca
Una mushasha shula de Chihuahua
Me vendió una mashaca
Una mushasha shula de Chihuahua

Rubia la mushasha parecía gabacha
Tenía buena facha y también buena nacha
Rubia la mushasha parecía gabacha
Tenía buena facha y también buena nacha

Y cuando me despacha me dice al oído
Me quiero poner contigo borracha
Contigo borracha
Contigo borracha
Contigo borracha

Ay mushasha

Una mushasha shula de Chihuahua
Me vendió una mashaca
Una mushasha shula de Chihuahua

Una mushasha shula de Chihuahua

Rubia la mushasha parecía gabacha
Tenía buena facha y también buena nacha
Rubia la mushasha parecía gabacha
Tenía buena facha y también buena nacha

Y cuando me despacha me dice al oído
Me quiero poner contigo borracha
Contigo borracha
Contigo borracha
Contigo borracha

Ay Mushasha

Esa mushasha es mi cuatacha
Y en mi carcacha me apapacha
Qué buena racha tengo yo
Con la mushasha

Esa mushasha es mi cuatacha
Y en mi carcacha me apapacha
Qué buena racha tengo yo

Isabelle!
Seninle mezara ben
Gecemi gündüz eden
Üçü sen dört heceden
Isabelle
Isabelle
Isabelle

Bebek ich schnapp dich 
küss dich, packe deine Hüften in der Hand und mach dich glücklich yayaya ya 

Isa beißt mich - yavaş
Baby kein intikam 
Ama geldiği zaman  
Sagt sie “yaya”

I-sa-belle
Bana yeter
Bura zindan, gel
İnat etme

Devam eder
İstemem bi’ kere daha 
Gizledi benden deva
Ama neden?
Üzemem kendimi daha
Gülden çok dikeni var
Anlamaz beni hayır

Sana ben daha ne diyeyim ki 
Bence bi bildiği var
Onu sal, yola gel
Bi’ tutam karamel

Isabelle!
Seninle mezara ben
Gecemi gündüz eden
Üçü sen dört heceden
Isabelle

Bebek ich schnapp dich 
küss dich, packe deine Hüften in der Hand und mach dich glücklich yayaya ya 

Isa beißt mich - yavaş
Baby kein intikam 
Ama geldiği zaman  
Sagt sie “yaya”


Babe ich habe meine Wumme aus meinem Schoß gelegt , nur damit du mich verstehst also leg dich in mein Arm 

du hast mich in deinem Bann aber so gesehen 
habe ich alles nur gespielt von Anfang an 

aber du trinkst Zuviel pinacolada 
Baby Versuchs mal mit einem Glas Wasser 
Ich Seh das du betrunken bist 
wie du nach unten gehst komm wir fangen wieder an von Anfang an

Isabelle!
Seninle mezara ben
Gecemi gündüz eden
Üçü sen dört heceden
Isabelle

TEXT:
Nimm es mir nicht übel, nein, ich spüre keine Liebe
Schnelles Geld, viele Sünden, deshalb mach ich Dua
Neue Welt, neue Ordnung, während Mama in ihr'm Bett liegt
Machen ihre Söhne Tijara
Wer macht hier Schnappschüsse? Paparazzi
Bilder hängen beim LKA
Der Kühlschrank ist leer und die Taschen sind leer
Fick die Welt, mittlerweile ist uns alles egal
Dеr Mond über dem Berg, guck, еr spiegelt sich im Meer
Vertrau besser nur dir selbst nach dem Sonnenuntergang
Wer den Frieden nicht mag, hat den Krieg nie geseh'n
Yemma, bitte reich mir die Hand
Die Lügner werden mehr, auch ein Ghettomillionär
Ist nicht sicher auf Beton mit der Knarre in der Hand
Sie sagt, dass sie dich liebt, aber wenn dir was geschieht
Fickt sie mit dem nächstem Typen schneller als du gucken kannst
Alkohol fließt hier am Block, mi amor, wie ein Wasserfall
Und ich trink, und ich trink, tauche ab, bis ich nicht mehr atmen kann
Die Klinge geht rein und die Lunge geht auf wie ein Butterfly
Ich bin nicht da, ich bin in Gedanken verlor'n im Himalaya
Seit Tagen unterwegs, hab die Sonne nicht geseh'n
Nur der Mond gibt uns Licht, wir sind Kinder dieser Nacht
Rote Augen leuchten hell, begeh die Sünden viel zu schnell
Meine Rechnung zahl ich am jüngsten Tag
Unterdrücken fällt mir schwer, steht die Hoffnung in den Sternen
Für ein gutes Leben brauchst du mehr als Glück und Verstand
Der Kühlschrank bleibt leer und die Taschen bleiben leer
Es ist kalt, hol die nächste Flasche raus aus dem Schrank
Häng auf Dächern mit den Jungs, alle Handys sind auf stumm
Warum ruft ihr uns nur an, wenn ihr Bastarde Probleme habt?
Wir bleiben stramm, Bullen klopfen tagtäglich an
Aufgestrapst, immer wieder durch die Gegend fahr'n
Tanzen mit dem Tod, zünd Kerzen erst am Ende von dem Lied an
Viele sind gekommen, doch die meisten sind schon wieder weg
Nur aus Liebe und Respekt, ich werd euch niemals vergessen
Niemals vergessen, check!
Alkohol fließt hier am Block, mi amor, wie ein Wasserfall
Und ich trink, und ich trink, tauche ab bis ich nicht mehr atmen kann
Die Klinge geht rein und die Lunge geht auf wie ein Butterfly
Ich bin nicht da, ich bin in Gedanken verlor'n im Himalaya
Alkohol fließt hier am Block, mi amor, wie ein Wasserfall
Und ich trink, und ich trink, tauche ab, bis ich nicht mehr atmen kann
Die Klinge geht rein und die Lunge geht auf wie ein Butterfly
Ich bin nicht da, ich bin in Gedanken verlor'n im Himalaya

Como un cuchillo en la mantequilla

contemplar la luna

No te prometo amor eterno 
porque no puedo 
soy tripulante de una nube

Letra de «16,437 Días»

En una semana abrimos
el alma cada amanecer.
Los días más bellos,
los más amorosos,
nunca olvidaré.

La gran coincidencia:
Mirarme en tus ojos,
¡qué revolución!
Tu pinta de artista,
mi protagonista,
por fin te encontré.

Sé que tal vez
hay un milagro
entre nosotros.

Quiero creer
que todo es posible,
que somos invencibles
y que lo nuestro
estaba escrito.

Que nunca estuve solo,
que siempre me quisiste.
Hoy firmo que el amor existe.
¿Cómo negarlo?,
¿cómo explicarlo?

16 437 días para encontrarte
y, de repente,
apareciste aquel instante,
jardín de flores en pleno otoño.
Tú tan radiante y yo tan solo.

Sé que tal vez
hay un milagro
entre nosotros.

Quiero creer
que todo es posible,
que somos invencibles
y que lo nuestro 
estaba escrito.

Que nunca estuve solo, 
que siempre me quisiste.
Hoy firmo que el amor existe.
¿Cómo olvidarlo?, 
¿cómo explicarlo?

¿Cómo negarlo?,
¿cómo explicarlo?

Letras:

Es una descarada por ser la más hermosa 
No tiene casi nada pero le gusta la vida cara 
Y a mí me gusta ella y sé cuanto me ama 
Sé que sueña conmigo pero amanece en otra cama 

El dinero le robó su corazón 
Las mentiras le desalmaron el alma 
Y me duele su dolor mucho más que su traición 
Yo nací para quererla aunque se vaya 

Mujer de nadie, mujer de todos, mujer que mata 
Mujer que duele, mujer que entrega y te arrebata 
Mujer tan cara, mujer ingrata

Yo sé que no me olvidaras aunque te vayas",True,True,59923120.0,Not Found

Chiquita.. 
Estoy tan solo, desamparado, tocando fondo.. 
en un desierto, sudando frio, mordiendo polvo.. 
pidiendole a gritos, a mi pasado q me responda 
pa entender tu partida.. para curarme la herida.. 
para que ya no me jodas.. 

me canse de esperarte de día, de noche, de madrugada 
rogandole a dios por que regresaras.. 
bebiendome el llanto de mi dolor.. 
se que tu no lo entiendes 
por eso no quiero volver a verte

Letras:

Como un cuchillo en la mantequilla 
entraste a mi vida cuando me moría 
como la luna por la rendija 
así te metiste entre mis pupilas. 

Y así te fui queriendo a diario 
sin una ley sin un horario 
y así me fuiste despertando 
de cada sueño donde estabas tu 

Y nadie lo buscaba y nadie lo planeo así 
en el destino estaba que fueras para mi 
y nadie lo apostaba aquello fuera tan feliz 
pero cupido se apiado de mi.",True,True,19012635.0,Latin pop

Lyrics:
The mirror's image, it tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin', carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin' of bumpin' into you

Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message, you reply
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
""Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, well, are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions, and havin' bad ideas

Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
""Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

And I can't see you here, wonderin' where am I
It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time
I haven't found all I was hopin' to find
You said you gotta be up in the mornin'
Gonna have an early night
And you're startin' to bore me, baby

Why'd you only call me when you're high?
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""

Lyrics

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

We go fast with the game we play
Who knows why it's gotta be this way
We say nothing more than we need
I say, ""Your place"" when we leave

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
Yeah

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh

Letra:

[Intro: Brytiago & Ozuna]
Perdemos veinte horas peleando por el día
Pero siempre sobran cuatro
Pa' dárselo en cuatro
Y aunque la relación es una mierda (Woh-oh)
Con sexo se arregla (Ozuna)

[Coro: Ozuna & Brytiago]
Por eso cuando llega se queda, ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah)
Le pido un canto de eso y me lo da, ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah)
Dice que me ama, pero, nah, nah, nah (Nah, nah)
Dice que me odia, pero, nah, nah, nah (Nah, nah)
Mucho bla, bla, bla
Y se queda ah, ah (Oh)
Le pido un canto de eso y me lo da, ah, ah
Dice que me ama, pero, nah, nah, nah
Dice que me odia, pero, nah, nah, nah
Mucho bla, bla, bla

[Verso 1: Arcangel]
Baby
Tú quieres acción
Todas tus amigas saben mi reputación
Dicen que le meto violento (Auh), bien duro la penetración (Uuf)
También dicen que soy pequeño (Ah), pero tengo un bicho cabrón (Wow)
Tú lo sabes, todas lo saben, yo lo sé también
Dime que tú estas dispuesta a hacer por estos billetes de 100
Yo, tengo una funda entera, y eso que no uso cartera
Aprovecha el tiempo que de dónde vengo los chavos se guardan hasta en la nevera
Baby (Baby), dime que tú quieres hacer (-cer)
Si te quieres entretener (-ner), allí nos espera el hotel
Baby, baby, baby
Si quieres nos vamos al cuarto llegamos
Prendemos, fumamos, luego nos matamos
(La Marash)

[Coro: Ozuna & Brytiago]
Por eso cuando llega se queda, ah, ah (Ah-ah-ah)
Le pido un canto de eso y me lo da, ah, ah (Ah-ah-ah)
Dice que me ama, pero, nah, nah, nah (Nah, nah)
Dice que me odia, pero, nah, nah, nah (Nah. nah)
Mucho bla, bla, bla
Y se queda ah, ah (Oh)
Le pido un canto de eso y me lo da, ah, ah
Dice que me ama, pero, nah, nah, nah
Dice que me odia, pero, nah, nah, nah
Mucho bla, bla, bla

[Verso 2: Ozuna]
(Ozuna)
Dice que me odia (Nah, nah), que no me quiere (Quiere)
Que tengo miles de mujeres (Jaja), y que nunca voy a cambiar
Me llama y quiere sexo, me pongo pa' eso
Se me trepa encima (Encima) y comienza el proceso
Nunca la nena se quita
Tengo mucha' pero e' mi favorita
Se pone mala y al oído me grita
Como le gusta que el momento se repita
Nadie, puede ganarle aunque ella lo niega
Pero su mejor amiga me dijo que soy el que al cielo la eleva, yah

[Puente: Brytiago]
Aunque tengamos mil problemas
Tú bien sabes que en mi cama resolvemos, baby
Somos dos locos poseídos amarrado' por el sexo, baby
Y yo muero contigo, tu cuerpo es la droga que a mí me llevo a la perdición
Por eso tú me buscas porque yo soy el que hace que te vengas sin control

[Coro: Ozuna & Brytiago]
Por eso cuando llega se queda, ah, ah (Ah-ah-ah)
Le pido un canto de eso y me lo da, ah, ah (Ah-ah-ah)
Dice que me ama, pero, nah, nah, nah (Nah, nah)
Dice que me odia, pero, nah, nah, nah (Nah, nah)
Mucho bla, bla, bla
Y se queda ah, ah (Oh)
Le pido un canto de eso y me lo da, ah, ah
Dice que me ama, pero, nah, nah, nah
Dice que me odia, pero, nah, nah, nah
Mucho bla, bla, bla

[Verso 3: Cosculluela]
(Brrr)
Yo no le llevo ni flores, ni Victoria de olores
Solo un baby doll pa' cuando esté mejor me modele y tenga mil colores
Así me quita el mal humor
Me la engancho y le doy a vapor
La pongo en cuatro, se acabó el teatro, hoy voy a meterte terror
Yo te daño el día, te alegro la noche
Esta es tu fantasía, sin comprarte Dolce
Te monto en el Porsche y hacemos lo que tú quieras
Esto es to'a la noche, fumando en el Panamera
Solo pide de mí porque la trato así
No quiere con su novio, el es un wannabe
Ay, tú, uh
Nadie me lo hace como tú, uh, uh, uh (Jaja)

[Coro: Ozuna & Brytiago]
Por eso cuando llega se queda, ah, ah (Ah-ah-ah)
Le pido un canto de eso y me lo da, ah, ah (Ah-ah-ah)
Dice que me ama, pero, nah, nah, nah (Nah, nah)
Dice que me odia, pero, nah, nah, nah (Nah, nah)
Mucho bla, bla, bla
Y se queda ah, ah (Oh)
Le pido un canto de eso y me lo da, ah, ah
Dice que me ama, pero, nah, nah, nah
Dice que me odia, pero, nah, nah, nah
Mucho bla, bla, bla

Me Acostumbré Letra

[ARCANGEL] 
Hoy me levanté del lao' izquierdo de la cama. 
(De la cama, de la cama) 
Que no quiero dramas y por eso rolo un finisito'e marihuana. 
Par de miles me busqué, 
joseando por la mañana, 
logré comprarme mi cubana. 
Me compré mi carro y mi mansión en la nación americana. 
Nací pa' ser millo, no quiero fama. 

[BAD BUNNY] 
Ya me acostumbré, 
ya me acostumbré, 
a siempre ganar como el 23 
Ya me acostumbré, 
Ya me acostumbré, 
a callarle la boca al que no me cree 

[ARCANGEL] 
Ya me acostumbré 
ya me acostumbré, 
a no importarme el precio de lo que compré. 
Ya me acostumbré, 
ya me acostumbré, 

[BAD BUNNY] 
a clavarme toa' estas putas de tres en tres. 

[ARCANGEL] 
Dejarme contarte como yo lo hacía hace 15 años atrás, 
me sentaba con Yeezy donde cabe el kilo hasta que no quedaba más. 
Luego las cosas cambiaron 
y nos pusimos a cantar, 
el mundo viajar, la funda a llegar, 
ya no había que bregar. 
No, pero si tu quiere' que te hable de droga con gusto menor yo te enseño. 
conozco'los capo' y ninguno son sapos, dominican' puertorriqueño. 
No me llevo mucho con los empleados 
(porque) 
por la sencilla razón de que me crié con los dueños. 
Un día un pana mío un par de millones de él me puso a contar, 
duré toa' la noche contando billetes y la mano me empezó a picar. 
Pasaron las horas y yo estaba lejos de todavía terminar, 
pa' mi que eso fue una señal, 
que luego me iba a tocar. 

[BAD BUNNY] 
Ya me acostumbré, 
ya me acostumbré, 
a siempre ganar como el 23 
Ya me acostumbré, 
ya me acostumbré, 
a callarle la boca al que no me cree. 

[ARCANGEL] 
Ya me acostumbré 
ya me acostumbré, 
a no importarme el precio de lo que compré 
Ya me acostumbré, 
ya me acostumbré, 
a clavarme estas putas de tres en tres. 

[BAD BUNNY] 
Me acostumbré a que el envidioso siempre me traicione 
y que por las botas mi nombre mencione. 
Yo siempre picheo en la mía tranquilo, 
díselo Luian que te engancho este rabo de oro en el cuello 
y ahora paso un kilo. 
Las boobies siempre estelar, 
si no me crees pregunta en el banco popular. 
Los topos de kush nunca dan regular, 
este es high star game y tú no vas a jugar. 
Dando más palos que David Ortíz, 
ando con los viles loco dentro le tiro ''aquís',' 
me acostumbré a modelos con flow de París. 
Él me jodió Donald Trump, 
aceite en el vap y ya no fuman blunt, 
lo pongo a danzar kuduro como Don, 
me tocan y adelante el armaggedon. 
Gracias a Dios por el don, 
desde que firmé to's quieren coger 
pon tus balas movía'l tapón. 
Te puede' acercártele haciendo el three sixty 
y te damos tapón. 

[ARCANGEL] 
Ya me acostumbré 
ya me acostumbré, 
a no importarme el precio de lo que compré 
Ya me acostumbré, 
ya me acostumbré, 
a clavarme estas putas de tres en tres. 

[BAD BUNNY] 
Ya me acostumbré, 
ya me acostumbré, 
a siempre ganar como el 23 
Ya me acostumbré, 
ya me acostumbré, 
a callarle la boca al que no me cree.

LETRA

PALOMA MAMI 
Hoy es uno de esos días 
que me siento sola en casa
triste porque estar pendiente a ti me hace mal 
subire un par de historias 
como si nada me pasa 
super triste es verte con otra en instagram 
este es uno de esos dias 
que no todo sale bien 
pero prefiero sentirme asi que volver 
REMIX 

FEID 
Aqui estoy , Ultra Solo 
pensando en que me cambiaste por otro 
pensando en como lo perdimos todo 
pensando en como lo perdimos todo 
Aqui estoy , Ultra Solo 
pensando en que me cambiaste por otro 
pensando en como lo perdimos todo 
pensando en como lo perdimos todo 
Prendí un bareto y leí tu conversación 
leyendo lo que me decía todo se me paro 
nadie llena el vacio que dejas en mi habitación 
que hueva yo que te volvi a dedicar otra canción 
Nose si llamara, o si respondera 
solo que tengo ganas de ... 
algún día yo se que tu me extrañaras 
si vas a llamar sin ropita por cámara 
pa verte toa´ bebe los perros también se enamoran 
si tu nunca te saliste de mi cora 
es que tu bailas de una forma que provoca tenerte y tocarte ...
 
POLIMÁ WESTCOAST 
Aqui estoy, sin atao´ 
prendiendo un phillie solo y coronao 
de que sirve si no esta a mi lao´
por ti paso el día conectau´
pendiente al cel, pendiente a ti 
pendiente si subes una storie 
pendiente pa ver si solo estas feliz 
y como no estas aquí ...
Hoy es uno de esos días 
que me siento solo en casa 
yo aquí triste porque te vi en el historial 
Subiré un par de historias 
y te escribire en el whatsapp 
super triste es verte con otro en instagram 
Aquí estoy, Ultra Solo 
pensando en que me cambiaste por otro 
pensando en como lo perdimos todo 
pensando en como lo perdimos todo 
Aquí estoy, Ultra Solo 
pensando en que me cambiaste por otro 
pensando en como lo perdimos todo 
pensando en como lo perdimos todo

PALOMA MAMI 
Ultra sola, ultra rica , perdiste senda gatita 
ahora vivo a lo maldita , de la calle quien me quita 
estoy cura del espanto como una bliky 
combina toa´ rosa como hello kitty 
en un bichiputeo se sube la mini 
hoy ando desacata pa´ olvidar los feelings 
Pero últimamente cuando caen las 3am 
quisiera llamarte aunque yo se que no conviene
las noches son frías aunque me encuentre entre la gente 
papi no hay carrete que te saque de mi mente
Aquí estoy, Ultra Sola 
pensando en que me cambiaste por otra 
pensando en como lo perdimos todo
pensando en como lo perdimos todo
Aquí estoy, Ultra Sola 
pensando en que me cambiaste por otra 
pensando en como lo perdimos todo
pensando en como lo perdimos todo

PAILITA 
Hoy me siento solo, me siento en un desierto 
es una pesadilla, pero estando despierto 
sin ti yo estoy triste, y contigo contento 
el tiempo pasa lento, quizás no era el momento 
Aun me acuerdo de esas noches que estabas bailando 
y tu en la discoteca me estabas mirando 
pusieron la canción que yo escuchaba llorando
fuiste mi estrella fugaz yo te paso deseando 
en la noche extrañandote
en la disco habían mil y yo pensandote 
con esa carita estas tentándome 
aunque se que por dentro esta dañandome yeah 
Puras poesías por la noche te dedicaría 
y aun sabiendo que tu a mi me dañarías 
ya no me siento solo, tengo otra otra que me hace compañía 
y ella cumple lo que tu me prometias. 
Tu besos me saben a miel 
yo quiero tocarte la piel 
quiero que tu seas mi mujer
no quiero que la vayamos a vender
mi amor sincero te puedo ofrecer
miremos juntitos el amanecer 
mientras nos estamos besando 
yo quiero que tu seas mi champions

DE LA GHETTO 
Super mega ultra solo
Y no puedo darte unfollow
Dicen que los hombres no lloran
Por ese culito lloro 
Baby girl me siento triste
desde que te fuiste mami no salgo del dispen,(ahh)
Viendo la foto que subiste
y ahora pa colmo los video haciendo fitness,
Es que, 
Ahora te ando buscando por New york city,
Yo aqui solo capsuleando una miti miti,
Y mezclando el acohol con las picky picky, 
Mami dejame probarte aunque sea un quicky 
Vuelve ya, que me dolio, tu me quiere ma' , eso creo yo, si tu no viras esto se jodio, 
si te veo con el se murio (x2)
