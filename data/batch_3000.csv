Alesso is once again stepping out on his own with solo production 'Years', a track that is undoubtedly going to prove ubiquitous over the coming months. After being premiered on Swedish House Mafia's takeover of Pete Tong's Radio 1 show earlier this year the instrumental version of 'Years' immediately had EDM fans excited, and now Alesso is set to release the highly anticipated vocal version of the track featuring Matthew Koma on 4th August. Energized by the optimistic swoon of Koma's lyrics, Alesso's production shines as the shimmering piano melodies explode in a flurry of driving drums and uplifting, anthemic synths that are destined to soundtrack the summer and ignite festivals all over the world.

About Blur: 
Blur were formed in 1989 by Damon Albarn, Graham Coxon, Alex James and Dave Rowntree and signed with Food/EMI the same year. Announcing their arrival with debut album Leisure in 1991, Blur continued to revolutionise the sound of English popular music with second release Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993). Five successive UK #1 albums followed - with Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995) helping to propel the band to mass popularity in the UK and beyond. The eponymous Blur was released in 1997 and seventh album Think Tank (2003) was Blur’s first as a three-piece after the temporary departure of founding guitarist Graham Coxon. 

Twenty one years after the release of their debut album, 2012 saw Blur 21: The Box, the band's body of work compiled and gathered together into one box. Their most recent release as a four-piece, the critically acclaimed chart-topping album The Magic Whip (2015), started life in Hong Kong when the band had an unexpected break in touring in May 2013.

About Blur: 
Blur were formed in 1989 by Damon Albarn, Graham Coxon, Alex James and Dave Rowntree and signed with Food/EMI the same year. Announcing their arrival with debut album Leisure in 1991, Blur continued to revolutionise the sound of English popular music with second release Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993). Five successive UK #1 albums followed - with Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995) helping to propel the band to mass popularity in the UK and beyond. The eponymous Blur was released in 1997 and seventh album Think Tank (2003) was Blur’s first as a three-piece after the temporary departure of founding guitarist Graham Coxon. 

Twenty one years after the release of their debut album, 2012 saw Blur 21: The Box, the band's body of work compiled and gathered together into one box. Their most recent release as a four-piece, the critically acclaimed chart-topping album The Magic Whip (2015), started life in Hong Kong when the band had an unexpected break in touring in May 2013.

I remember flashbacks lighting up magic whip
Eight o'clock, Kowloon emptiness, handle it
The wide old sea image I had to view 11 seconds ago
I didn't send you, so you will never know

I got away for a little while
But then it came back much harder

Swinging on the cable line to Po Lin
Climbing down the ghostly wine in a battery
That light in your eyes, I search for religiously
Oh, when it's not there, oh Lord, it's hurting me

I got away for a little while
But then it came back much harder

Till I ever hold you back there again
Will you be mine
Cause I'm on a ghost ship driving my heart
In Hong Kong
It's the last ride boarding here tonight
Out in the bay (out in the bay), I need a lightning in you to shine out
Bright race

Feelin' outta body here, what can I do?
It's up to the top everyday to join here with you

But then it came back much harder",False,False,57474754.0,alternative rock

LYRICS
Father:
It’s not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You’re still young, that’s your fault
There’s so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old but I’m happy
I was once like you are now
And I know that it’s not easy
To be calm when you’ve found
Something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Why, think of everything you’ve got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not

Son:
How can I try to explain, when I do he turns away again?
It’s always been the same, same old story
From the moment I could talk, I was ordered to listen
Now there’s a way, and I know that I have to go
Away, I know I have to go

Father:
It’s not time to make a change
Just sit down, take it slowly
You’re still young, that’s your fault
There’s so much you have to go through
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old but I’m happy

Son:
Away, away, away, I know
I have to make this decision alone – no

Son:
All the times that I’ve cried, keeping all the things I knew inside
It’s hard, but it’s harder to ignore it
If they were right I’d agree, but it’s them you know not me
Now there’s a way and I know that I have to go
Away, I know, I have to go

Father:
Stay, stay, stay, why must you go and
Make this decision alone? No

Featured on the classic 'Teaser and the Firecat' album, Morning Has Broken was adapted from a traditional hymn with words by Eleanor Farjeon. The song's message beautifully reflected Cat's growing spiritual awareness in the early 1970s; a sense of wonderment, awe and gratitude for the miracle of creation is expressed through praise for the coming of the new day. Cat arranged the song, giving it his own inimical sense of style and passion and invited Rick Wakeman of YES to record the now legendary piano part.

Oh Lord, how they play and play

Amenez du thé pour le laboureur
Du steak pour le soleil,
Du vin pour la femme qui a fait venir la pluie,

Yusuf / Cat Stevens performs ‘Oh Very Young’ live on his Majikat - Earth Tour 1976. 
Cat Stevens' Majikat - Earth Tour was recorded during his last legendary North American tour in 1976. It was an ambitious production involving live magicians, synchronized film projection and large innovative stage set. This was the ultimate tour of Cat Stevens before he quit the music business and became Yusuf Islam; he didn't perform on stage again for nearly thirty years.

ABOUT THE LAST OF US PART II 
Set five years after the events of The Last of Us, players enter the role of 19-year-old Ellie, who comes into conflict with a mysterious Christian cult in a post-apocalyptic United States. The game contains survival horror elements and is played from the third-person perspective. Players can use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus.

Lyrics:

Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence?
One step from lashing out at you
You want in to get under my skin and call yourself a friend
I've got more friends like you, what do I do?

Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself by yourself, stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time

Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?

Run your mouth when I'm not around, it's easy to achieve
You cry to weak friends that sympathize
Can you hear the violins playing your song?
Those same friends tell me your every word

Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself by yourself, stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time

Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talkin' to me?
Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?
No way, punk

Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talkin' to me?
Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?
Walk on home, boy

STORY BEHIND THE SONG (from Vinnie Paul): There was a guy in the front row in San Diego who was heckling Phil Anselmo (vocalist). Phil finally had enough, so he incited the crowd to jump this guy's ass and beat the shit out of him on the spot, so he sued us. And when his dad called our manager, his exact quote was, ""You just give me five minutes alone with that Phil Anselmo guy and I'll show him who's big daddy around here."" Phil's response was, ""You just give me five minutes with that cat's dad and I'll whoop his ass."" That's where that song came from.

Grabando el MTV Unplugged: El libro de las mutaciones
por Enrique Bunbury

No tengo claro cuál es la forma correcta de hacer las cosas.

Cualquiera simpatiza con la idea,
aparentemente fácil,
de hacerlas a tu manera,
sin hacer caso a nadie,
solo atendiendo a tus propias necesidades e impulsos.
Parece sensato.

Sin embargo,
cualquiera que haya realizado ""a su manera"",
un proyecto más o menos artístico o creativo,
sabrá de críticas feroces,
como si hubiera cometido sacrilegio,
o una herejía inaceptable.

Cuando me propusieron realizar un MTV Unplugged,
me sentí halagado.
La lista internacional de artistas que grabaron en el pasado, es abrumadora.
Pertenecer a ese club exclusivo de músicos con largas trayectorias
que se enfrentaron al mismo reto que me ofrecían,
era en sí mismo intimidante.
Creo, eso me han dicho, que hago el número 25 en la
vertiente latinoamericana.
No somos tantos.
Algunos de ellos son, según mi criterio, talentos indiscutibles.
Todos, compañeros de profesión dignos de absoluto respeto.

Mi única duda,
primero de todo,
fue pensar que ""Unplugged"" suponía una fórmula,
una manera concreta,
un decálogo de obligaciones.
Inamovible, indiscutible, incuestionable.
Pensar así, me hizo plantearme si merecía la pena,
si cabría yo en ese traje,
tan aparentemente estrecho.

Así, me planteé algunas premisas
para orientar el proyecto hacia mis intereses personales:
""El libro de las mutaciones"", no es un disco recopilatorio de grandes éxitos.
Ni es un disco acústico de músicos desenchufados frente a la chimenea.
He buscado entre mi repertorio
una selección de canciones que me apetecía replantear.
No abarco mis treinta años de carrera
de forma equitativa y justa.
Algunas no las tocaba hacía años
y pertenecen a mi primera década en la música
junto a mis compañeros de Héroes del Silencio (1986-1996).
Otras, las grabé con mi actual banda (Los Santos Inocentes),
durante el periodo 2006-2015.
Y también añadí un tema
que no aparece en ninguno de mis discos
y que permanecía inédito:
""Dos clavos a mis alas"".
Y aunque me lo pidieron, no hay covers.
La instrumentación es orgánica y vintage.
Hay guitarras acústicas, piano, percusión y batería;
pero también procesamos algunos sonidos,
utilizamos sintetizador mini moog, mellotron,
dobro, guitarras tenor y barítono.

Llamamos a algunos amigos importantes
para que nos acompañaran con sus voces, talento y buen hacer.
Pensando en ellos por la canción
que les iba como anillo al dedo.
Y no al revés,
cuando se cocinan los duetos desde los despachos.
Agradezco a Draco, León Larregui, Carla Morrison,
Pepe Aguilar y Vetusta Morla,
tenerme en consideración,
y aceptar pacientes los ensayos, las esperas interminables,
más ensayos y grabación.

Espero que la policía de lo correcto se quede en casa,
y se me permita la licencia de ser libre.
Y, todavía más importante,
espero disfruten de la propuesta
que grabamos y les ofrecemos,
con la sana intención de que esta música
les alcance y pertenezca.",True,True,86769906.0,Not Found

Lyrics:
Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze.
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.

All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.

You know how these tricks we be buyin' 'em clothes
Wanna taxi hoes on vogues with the beat
And have 'em sittin' next to 'em in the front seat

And my motto is fuck a hoe and hit the throttle

Lyrics:

Girl, I been shaking, sticking, and moving tryin' to get you and that booty
Tryin' to get to you and that booty
Tryin' to get to you and that booty
Girl, I been shaking and acting a donkey tryin' to get you and that monkey
Tryin' to get to you and that monkey
Tryin' to get to you and that monkey
Girl, he simpin' (Simpin')
I walk up in the club with a limpin' (limpin')
God listen, what you gonna do with this pimpin'?
What you gonna do with this pimpin'?
Girl, I'm a call ya (call ya)
Later on tonight or tomorrow ('morrow), now follow
What you gonna do with this baller?
What you gonna do with this baller?
What you gonna do when I bend the block (bend the block)?
Pull up on that ass in a brand new drop (brand new drop)?
Speakers on blast with tremendous knock ('mendous knock)?
TV's in the dash, rims just won't stop
You need to be down with a pimp like me
I ain't turning down nothing but my collar, you see
I'm a leave you with my number; you should holler at me
'Cause I'm a baller; can't nobody hustle harder than me, oh
Oh, your ass is right
I ain't tryin' to let that pass me tonight
I'm a put my bid in and tell you something slick
Whisper in your ear while I'm holding my dick
I don't mean no harm, it's the hood in me (hood in me)
Sipping on that Renshaw Hennessy (Hennessy)
Psychedelic colors in my jewelry (jewelry)
Suckers hella jealous 'cause you digging me, oh
Now what you gonna do, mama?
I'm tryin' to dip later on, me and you, mama
I like the way that you groove and you move, mama
You know the women love me; I'm the forty water (forty water)
Popping my P's 'cause I'm laced with game
Nothin' but the Yay flowing through my vein
She wear Miss Sixty, can't fit in the Gucci
'Cause her ass big enough to sit a cup on her booty (goodness!)
Yeah, I see you looking (looking)
But my ass in these jeans got you shook, and (shook, and)
I don't think you know what to do with this pussy
What you gonna do with this pussy?
Yeah, I know you want this (want this)
Tryin' to chase me through the club for this good shit (good shit)
But I don't think you can handle this pussy
What you gonna do with this pussy?
You looking like you got that good gooshy, gooshy
Fucking 'round with me, I beat the brakes off that pussy
Have your ass cumming like a porn star movie
Tell your friends, and I bet they all wanna do me
Hos know me, I'm E-Fo-Oh (E-Fo-Oh)
They recognize pimping when I step in the door (step in the door)
Higher than a satellite full of that dro (full of that dro)
Holla at a playa when you ready to go, oh

LYRICS
Big subwoofer in the back like wassup
Blow the windows out the frame if somebody wanna pull up
Big subwoofer in the back like wassup
Blow the windows out the frame if somebody wanna pull up
Big subwoofer in the back like wassup
Blow the windows out the frame if somebody wanna pull up
Big subwoofer in the back like wassup
Blow the windows out the frame if somebody wanna pull up 
 
Money taller than the trees in Yosemite 
Got my 40 on me, that’s my mini me.
Damn near anything I want I can afford it. Listen
Never hustle backwards, always forward. Progression.
I got multitask always on the grind. Awe
I can walk and chew gum at the same-time.
I ain’t on hiatus, I ain’t missing in action.
I'm the center of attention, bitch, the main attraction.
When I enter the turf, when I pull up. People gather around me
Like an ice cream truck, no cappin
 
People always ask me what I do for a liv..
I wear many hats, I’m something like lids.
I love liquor and sex, booty and breast.
A couple stretch marks and cellulite on her flesh.
She got her legs open like a field goal poll, 
booty softer than a king Hawaiian roll. Bitch.
 
Big subwoofer in the back like wassup
Blow the windows out the frame if somebody wanna pull up
Big subwoofer in the back like wassup
Blow the windows out the frame if somebody wanna pull up
Big subwoofer in the back like wassup
Blow the windows out the frame if somebody wanna pull up
Big subwoofer in the back like wassup
Blow the windows out the frame if somebody wanna pull up
 
Big subwoofer bouncing like a trampoline
Glass shake when I roll past the scene 
Candy apple paint dripping classic green
Everybody eating, you can ask the team, 
fast and mean, speaking bumping, tags is clean
Keep me something to smoke on.
Bad bitch to poke on, bass hit like an earthquake 
You niggas hold on, I hit the block and roll on …
 
My bitch got ass like two 18s.
Her favorite too short song, is in those jeans.
Shake it baby if you like this song
Do a nasty dance everytime they turn it on 
Its got more bass than baseball. 
She down on her knees, she want a facial.
I gotta give her what she want, turn it up
Loud, and let that shit bump
Everybody love the funk, stopping in the trunk 
You I the back seat wishin you was in the front.
She said something, asked me if I heard.
But bitch I can’t hear one mother fuckin word. Bitch
 
Big subwoofer in the back like wassup
Blow the windows out the frame if somebody wanna pull up
Big subwoofer in the back like wassup
Blow the windows out the frame if somebody wanna pull up
Big subwoofer in the back like wassup
Blow the windows out the frame if somebody wanna pull up
Big subwoofer in the back like wassup
Blow the windows out the frame if somebody wanna pull up
 
Big subwoofer, big titty hooker, cocaine cooker, 
Rooftop looker. 
Look out and saw TJ Hooker, jumped off the roof like superfly snooker
You know me im up in it like booger, then I treat the bitch like some dice and I shook her. I heard this youngin screaming like woman, yelling that they coming, 
Nigga we aint running.
Its a new day, still got the ak if these bitches take it back to 88
Turn the music down for we locking horns, keep the party going 
Its a false alarm. 
 
Big subwoofer in the back like wassup
Blow the windows out the frame if somebody wanna pull up
Big subwoofer in the back like wassup
Blow the windows out the frame if somebody wanna pull up
Big subwoofer in the back like wassup
Blow the windows out the frame if somebody wanna pull up
Big subwoofer in the back like wassup
Blow the windows out the frame if somebody wanna pull up

Lyrics:
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go
Go [Dumb x8]
Jesus Christ had dreads
So shake 'em
I ain't got none
But I'm planning on growing some
Imagine all the Hebrews going dumb
Dancing on top of chariots and turning tight one
Ooh, tell me when to go
Talking on my ghettro on the way to the sto'
My 2nd or 3rd trip
Some Henny
Some Swishers
And some Listerine Strips
Dr. Greenthumb lift
Just to ease my thoughts
Not just the cops
But the homies you got to watch
The moon is full
Look at the dark clouds
Sitting in my scraper
Watching Oakland go wild
Ta-dow!
I don't bump mainstream
I knock underground
All that other shit
Sugar-coated and watered down
I'm from the Bay where we hyphy and go dumb
From the soil where them rappers be getting they lingo from
Tell me when to go [x4]
Go [Dumb x8]
Tell me when to go [x4]
Go [Dumb x8]
I'm off that 18 purple juice
Like a man
Labeled the Black Zeus
King of the Super Duper (Hyphy x5)
And your wifey
She don't (Like me x5)
From the Bay to the A
Put me in the back wood
Swisha sweet buds
Go to the sto'
Bitches wish I wrote
I said they couldn't be saved by (John Doe x2)
I slid past on the gas
Bitches looking at me
It's good x2
Like the granddaddy
Cross game
You get flipped like a burger patty
Or zig-zagged
Pass me a big old fatty
I drink white with a snow bunny
Talking big shit in the scraper
Goin hella dummy
1800
Jose Cuervo
Yaddadamean
Know I'm saying, though?
Tell me when to go [x4]
Go [Dumb x8]
Tell me when to go [x4]
Go [Dumb x8]
Ghost-ride the whip
[x8] Now Scrape
[x4] Put your stunnin' shades on
[x2] Now, gas, brake, dip, dip
[x4] Shake them dreads
[x4] Let me see you show ya grill
[x4] Now Thizz-Face
[x4] Doors open, man.
[x4] Now... Watch em swang
Tell me when to go [x4]
Go [Dumb x8]
Tell me when to go [x4]
Go [Dumb x8]

Fania presents a remastered vinyl reissue of LO MATO (SI NO COMPRA ESTE LP), one of the key Fania Records albums that sums up the ’70s salsa movement in all its trendsetting glory. Released in 1973, just as the New York salsa movement reached a creative and commercial apex, the LP marked the end of a chapter for both Colón and Lavoe. It was the final entry in a spectacular series of collaborative albums that began with 1967’s El Malo and found the duo constantly recording and touring together. Following the release of Lo Mato, Lavoe would launch his epic solo career – with Colón as producer – while the ever-prolific Willie would branch out into collaborations with Celia Cruz, Mon Rivera, Rubén Blades, and his own solo output.

The new edition of Lo Mato was mastered and cut by Kevin Gray at Cohearent Audio and pressed on 180-gram audiophile quality vinyl.

When they signed with the Fania label in the late ’60s, Colón and Lavoe represented to the old guard of tropical music the impending threat of a younger generation, ready to renew the salsa genre with an edgier sound. Colón consciously cultivated the persona of a dangerous bad boy through fictitious posters that portrayed him as wanted by the FBI.

Musically, Colón and Lavoe accomplished a full renewal of Afro-Caribbean music. In their hands, salsa became alternately more rugged and sophisticated: imbued in Brazilian rhythms (“La María”), reverent to the roots of Puerto-Rican folk (“Guajira ven”), ready to detour into Latin jazz (“Junio 73”), but always armed with a killer instinct for massive hits (“Calle luna calle sol.”)

Lo Mato has everything you would expect from an Afro-Caribbean masterpiece. With its staccato cowbell pattern, jazzy piano lines and rough trombone riffs, “Calle luna calle sol” is one of Colón’s most inspired compositions – a cynical narrative about the dangerous streets of Puerto Rico, and one of salsa’s most enduring anthems. Co-written by the duo, “El día de mi suerte” is a deeper track, peerless in its vocal arrangement and instrumental complexity, the bitter lament of a luckless man that becomes even the more poignant considering that Lavoe died in 1993 at 46 years of age. “Todo tiene su final” is funky and philosophical, using a number of clever metaphors to support its thesis that everything comes to an end – including, as it turns out, the mercurial partnership between both artists.

Tracklist: 
SIDE A
1. Señora Lola
2. Todo tiene su final
3. La María
4. Junio 73

SIDE B

CÓMO ERAN LAS COSAS

Creo que es momento 
para otra bomba de humo 
y batirme en retirada. 
Nuestra sociedad me perjudica, 
vos no sos una chica cualquiera. 

Qué ridículo es que pienses 
que todo es tuyo, inclusive yo. 
Todo eso tuyo puede ser, 
pero esta noche es para los dos. 

Quizás fue en la mañana 
en que vendados los dos 
descubrimos cómo eran las cosas, 
y sin abrir los ojos nos teletransportamos 
adonde desearíamos estar. 

Entonces deshace el hechizo 
que me obliga a arrastrarme 
entre Guinea y tus sábanas. 
Nuestra sociedad no ayuda mucho, 
mientras la pasas bien, yo lucho. 

Quizás fue en la mañana 
en que vendados los dos 
descubrimos cómo eran las cosas, 
y sin abrir los ojos nos teletransportamos 
adonde desearíamos estar. 

Pero también lo siento, 
que sólo es un momento 
que todos deberíamos pasar. 

Quizás fue en la mañana 
en que vendados los dos 
descubrimos cómo eran las cosas, 
y sin abrir los ojos nos teletransportamos 
adonde desearíamos estar.

pisoteando sabios templos

Caifanes fue el primer disco en donde cada uno de los 4 integrantes llevaban varios años de estar tocando y ahora se encontraban juntos en un estudio haciendo lo que tanto amaban, que era hacer música. Este disco los dio la oportunidad de posicionarse en el movimiento Rock En Tu Idioma con canciones como: La Negra Tomasa, Viento, Mátenme Porque Me Muero y Cuéntame Tu Vida.

Gotas de lluvia, no es el rocio 
Lagrimas que vienen del corazon 
Gotas de lluvia, no es el rocio 
lagrimas que brotan por que ya no hay amor 

Pudiste haberme dicho que no 
que no sentias nada por mi 
que lo nuestro nunca fue algo especial 
la vida cambia y todo tiene final 
una aventura fue para ti 
y fácilmente yo en tus redes cai 
un trago amargo amargo que de ti resibi 
Ahora no se, no se que sera de mi 

Gotas de lluvia………………… 

Quisiera saber, saber por que se escapo 
De mis brazos toda la felicidad 
A toda maquina corriendo volo 
No dejo huella se desaparecio 
No le importo que yo sintiera temor 
De verme solo asi llorando de amor 
Y por su mente pienso que no paso 
Que por su culpa yo sintiera dolor 


Gotas de lluvia…………………… 

Verano azul que me calento 
Otoño gris que con el frio llego 

Poco a poco me fui quedando sin respiración 
Sin una explicación, hey, hey hey ………… 
mucho te quise tal vez 
Y el mundo me quedo al reves, 
ya no quiero vivir 
Sin ti para que existir 

Verano azul………………… 

Gotas de lluvia 
Dame valor que yo quiero saber la forma 
De olvidar tu amor 
Gotas de lluvia 

Gotas, gotas, gotas, no fue el rocio 
es desilusión.",False,True,115831899.0,salsa

Una aventura, es más bonita
Si no miramos el tiempo en el reloj
Una aventura, es más bonita
Cuando escapamos solos tu y yo
Una aventura, es más bonita
Si hacemos creer a los demás
Que no hay amor
Una aventura, es más bonita
Si existe dueño para cada uno
de los dos

Reventamos
Estamos que reventamos
Cada vez
Que de frente nos miramos
Y los pies
Bajo la mesa nos tocamos
Y un beso robado
Queda siempre como adios

Reventamos
Estamos que reventamos
Cada vez
Que de frente nos miramos
Y los pies
Bajo la mesa nos tocamos
Y un beso robado
Queda siempre como adiós

Una aventura, es más bonita
Cuando olvidamos que hace mucho
Pero mucho rato amaneció
Una aventura, es más bonita
Si sonrojamos porque otra persona
Se enteró
Una aventura, es más bonita
Si aquellas rosas prohibido saber
Quién la regaló
Una aventura, es más bonita
Cuando lloramos porque todo
Todo se acabó

Reventamos
Estamos que reventamos
Cada vez
Que de frente nos miramos
Y los pies
Bajo la mesa nos tocamos
Y un beso robado
Queda siempre como adiós

(Que bello es quererse así
Y no saber si habrá segunda vez)
Que minutos se vuelvan horas
Y que llueva y no pregunte la señora
Que llueva
(Que bello es quererse así
Y no saber si habrá segunda vez)
Y en un segundo entregarlo todo
Entregarlo todo, entregarlo todo
(Que bello es quererse así
Y no saber si habrá segunda vez)

Reventamos, estamos que reventamos
Cada vez
Que de frente nos miramos
Y los pies
Bajo la mesa nos tocamos
Y un beso robado
Queda siempre como adiós",False,True,112105441.0,salsa

No sé decir ""Te quiero"", pero me entrego
Pocas palabras al hablar, pero sincero
Uno que otro defecto, eso lo acepto
Quizás no el indicado, pero me ofrezco
No soy el sol que quema, pero caliento
No sé de poesías, pero enternezco
De pronto un poco tosco, pero acaricio
Y quererte a ti así, ese es mi vicio
Busca por dentro
Que pongo en juego todos mis sentimientos
Un beso y un abrazo exacto en el momento
Que me lo pidas, que me lo pidas
Busca por dentro, amor
Que hay una fuente inagotable de agua fresca
Y una llama que no dejo nunca que se apague
Y un corazón lleno de amor en mi equipaje
Busca por dentro, amor
Y llega como yo al total convencimiento
Escampa tus dudas en mis adentros
Que de ternura estoy hecho por dentro
No sé lo que es ganar, pero lo intento
Tal vez no arriesgo mucho, pero me atrevo
Si no me determinan desconozco
Si me toca perder lo reconozco
Le tengo miedo al mar, pero navego
Temo a la oscuridad, pero soporto
Ante la soledad yo me acongojo
Y como todo ser que vive río y lloro
Busca por dentro
Que pongo en juego todos mis sentimientos
Un beso y un abrazo exacto en el momento
Que me lo pidas, que me lo pidas
Busca por dentro, amor
Que hay una fuente inagotable de agua fresca
Y una llama que no dejo nunca que se apague
Y un corazón lleno de amor en mi equipaje
Busca por dentro, amor
Y llega como yo al total convencimiento
Escampa tus dudas en mis adentros
Que de ternura estoy hecho por dentro
Busca en mis entrañas, busca un poco más
Sin miedo a la oscuridad que te esperaré
Abrázame, entrégate a mí
Que quiero compartir contigo toda la esencia, toda la esencia de este amor
Busca en mis entrañas, busca un poco más
Sin miedo a la oscuridad que te esperaré
No lo pienses, no, no, no, cuando quieras
Un beso que queda ahí es definitivo, definitivo para mí
Busca en mis entrañas, busca un poco más
Sin miedo a la oscuridad que te esperaré

Letra:

Cali pachanguero, Cali luz de un nuevo cielo 
Cali pachanguero, Cali luz de un nuevo cielo 

De romántica luna, el lucero que es leno
De mirar en tu valle la mujer que yo quiero

Del jilguero que canta, calles que se levantan
Carnaval en juanchito todo un pueblo que inspira

Cali pachanguero, Cali luz de un nuevo cielo 
Cali pachanguero, Cali luz de un nuevo cielo 

Es por eso que espero que los días que lejos 
Cuando dure mi ausencia sabes bien que me muero
Todos los caminos conducen a ti
Si supieras la pena que un día sentí 
Cuando en frente de mí tus montañas no ví

Que todo, que todo, que todo que

Que todo el mundo te cante
Que todo el mundo te mime
Celoso estoy pa' que mires
No me voy más ni por miles

Permita que me arrepienta oh 
Mi bella cenicienta
De rodillas mi presencia 
Si mi ausencia fue tu afrenta

Que todo el mundo te cante
Que todo el mundo te mime
Celoso estoy pa' que mires
No me voy más ni por miles

Que noches, que noches tan bonitas
Siloé en sus callesitas
Al fondo mi valle en risa 
Ay todito se divisa

Que todo el mundo te cante
Que todo el mundo te mime
Celoso estoy pa' que mires
No me voy más ni por miles

Un clásico en el Pascual
Adornado de mujeres sin par 
América y Cali a ganar
Aquí no se puede empatar

Que todo el mundo te cante
Que todo el mundo te mime
Celoso estoy pa' que mires
No me voy más ni por miles

Barranquilla, puerta de oro 
París la ciudad luz 
Nueva York capital del mundo 
Y del cielo Cali, la sucursal 

Que todo el mundo te cante
Que todo el mundo te mime
Celoso estoy pa' que mires
No me voy más ni por miles

A millas siento tu aroma
Cualquiera justo razona
Que Cali es Cali señoras 
Señores lo demás es loma",True,True,67057110.0,salsa

Sí me besas en la boca, ternura
Sí me besas al amanecer
Sí me besas ya no queda duda
Que nuestro amor es tan grande como el mar
En tus labios rojos sólo hay dulzura
Y un camino a la felicidad
Entre paredes rosadas, un sueño
Que no quisiera nunca despertar
La magia de tus besos
Me tienen como loco
Me tienen como un tonto
Que ya no sé qué hacer
La magia de tus besos
Son mi único tesoro
Es lo que más adoro
No te voy a perder
En mi cuarto, sólo frente al nochero
Un pensamiento en la oscuridad
La tristeza que se mete en mi cuerpo
Por qué sucede siempre cuando tú no estás
En el cielo ya no quedan nubes
El horizonte está en la inmensidad
Así de grande como lo que yo siento
Ahora ya sé, que de mí nunca te irás
La magia de tus besos
Me tienen como loco
Me tienen como un tonto
Que ya no sé qué hacer
La magia de tus besos
Son mi único tesoro
Es lo que más adoro
No te voy a perder
Yo tengo la llave de tu corazón
Entro por la noche, salgo con el sol
Tú no sabes cuanto me duele cariño
Cuando no estas conmigo
Yo tengo la llave de tu corazón
Entro por la noche, salgo con el sol
Y esto es cosa de todos los días
Me haces vivir esta increíble fantasía
Yo tengo la llave de tu corazón
Entro por la noche, salgo con el sol
Quererte es lo más bello que ha podido
Suceder, en la existencia de mi vida
Yo tengo la llave de tu corazón
Entro por la noche, salgo con el sol
Yo tengo la llave, yo tengo la llave
Yo tengo la llave, yo tengo tu corazón en mi clave
Yo tengo la llave de tu corazón
Si voy a buscarte no le cambies,
Seguro a la chapa
Yo tengo la llave de tu corazón
Que si no puedo abrir la puerta
De pronto el frío, me mata
Yo tengo la llave de tu corazón
Yo tengo, la tengo
Y a buscarte vengo
Yo tengo la llave de tu corazón
Caliéntame con besos
Que yo no me enojo por eso",True,True,37794207.0,salsa

Rogers sings in a narrative about his nephew Tommy, a young man with an outstanding reputation for never defending himself; his pacifism earned him the mocking nickname ""Yellow"" from others across the county, But Rogers hinted that he always felt there was something about Tommy that he rest of the county could not see.

Tommy's non-violent attitude was greatly influenced by his father,
who died in prison when Tommy was ten; during his last
visits his father, from his deathbed, he pleads with Tommy not to
make the same mistakes he made, telling him to ""put the
other cheek ""is not a sign of weakness, and warning you Son, no
You have to fight to be a man.

Years later, Tommy is in a relationship with a woman named Becky.
who loves him and accepts him as he is. One day while Tommy was at the
At work, the three Gatlin brothers assault Becky and gang-rape her.
When Tommy returns home to find Becky crying and worse for him
attrition, faces the dilemma of having to choose between defending the
honor Becky or defend his father's plea to stay away from
problems when I can.

Realizing that he can't ignore his situation, Tommy goes to the bar
where the Gatlin hang out, but only laugh at him when he walks in.
After one of them meets him in the middle of the floor,
Tommy turns around and they assume he's going to walk away one more time until
stop and close the front door. Driven by his aggression
long repressed, Tommy breaks loose and fights furiously
With the three Gatlin boys, not leaving any of them standing
(the lyrics are ambiguous as to whether they were dead or unconscious)

Tommy then reflects on his late father's plea and tells him
with respect that, although he did everything possible to avoid problems,
he hopes his father understands that ""Sometimes you have to fight when you are
a man"".
