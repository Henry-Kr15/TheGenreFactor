Letra Oficial:
Ya no quiero luchar 
Ya no quiero pelear 
Hago a un lado las armas en las que confiaba y dejo ganar 

Me ha vencido tu amor y tu buen corazón 
He venido a rendirme a tus pies y decirte 
te doy el control 

Coro
Vengo hasta la cruz a rendirme 
Si quieres hoy recibirme 
Vengo a caer a tus pies 
y a decirte por siempre eres Tú mi Señor 
hoy te entrego las riendas de mi corazón 

Me cansé de pelear y tu amor evitar 
me di cuenta que pierdo 
si gano esta lucha contra la verdad 

Hasta aquí me alcanzó
mi obstinada razón.
He borrado la raya que me separaba de tu bendición 

Vengo hasta la cruz a rendirme 
Si quieres hoy recibirme 
Vengo a caer a tus pies 
y a decirte por siempre eres Tú mi Señor 
hoy te entrego las riendas... 

Vengo hasta la cruz a rendirme 
Si quieres hoy recibirme 
Vengo a caer a tus pies 
y a decirte por siempre eres Tú mi Señor 
hoy te entrego las riendas de mi corazón 

//De mi corazón//

Letra Oficial:
Como en un país extraño me encontré sin ti 
no entendía el idioma, ni las cosas que viví
y corrí a buscar sin ver tu rostro entre la gente 
y aún sin conocerte convencido estaba de encontrarte a ti 
de encontrarte a ti 

CORO 
Y en medio de mi confusión se alzaba tu bandera 
se enarbolaba como el sol diciéndome que fuera y a ti te siguiera 
y así me refugié en la cruz y en tu bendito amor 

Nunca imaginé la vida que ahora vivo en ti 
ni la gracia que me diste cuando a ti volví 
más ahora sé que en ti  yo tengo lo que anhelo 
tengo vida plena, tengo paz eterna 
si te tengo a ti 
si te tengo a ti 

Y en medio de mi confusión se alzaba tu bandera 
se enarbolaba como el sol diciéndome que fuera y a ti te siguiera 
y así me refugié en la cruz y en tu bendito amor.

Lyrics:
[Intro: Redman + Method Man]
Yo, ladies and gentlemen
We got Toni Braxton up in the house
So high that I can kiss the sky, bitch
We live up in here, y'all; let's get high!
Motherfucker, get high!

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Tical shittin' again, spittin' to win
Loaded guns, clip in the end, none sicker than him
Yes, indeed, I'm ill as any STD's or sex disease
These dirty rats want extra cheese
On that piece of the pie
Now ask me ""How high?"", I'll tell you ""Reach for the sky!""

Blame the Crooked Letter I
That's my home, 23's wrapped in chrome
Not only snap on y'all niggas but I'll snap them bones
Clap your dome, make you leave that crack alone
You got the key to the city but the latch is on?
I gots it locked, bringin' the noise, bringin' the Funk
Doctor Spock, bringin' my boys, bringin' you lungs
Pop the Glock, but only if you feel this shit
Jack the Ripper; don't make me have to kill this bitch!
Back to get ya, put it in check, that's the Mista
Meth with his wood on your neck, shut your lips up

[Hook: Toni Braxton + Method Man & Redman]
I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get

[Verse 2: Redman]
You can call on the man when the party is borin'
I'll have these hoes strippin' till it's part of the mornin'
I love a fat chick with a body enormous
It ain't about the weight, yo, it's how they performin'
My dash is 180, my weed half a pound
When the smoke in the air my nose like basset hounds
I don't stash the 'dro, nigga, divide
I'm that nigga that ride with trigger to give a supply
High is how I stay all the time
(Method Man: Niggas, close your doors!)
Yo, bitches, shut all your blinds!
If I'm hard to find, take two puffs and pass
I stay back, but my Benz moved up a class
It's Doc and Meth, the format is real sickenin'
Contagious, we out for Mr. Biggs' women
You better shut your trap when my dogs around
We pissin' on fire hydrants, so walk around, bitch!

[Hook: Toni Braxton + Method Man & Redman]
I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Mista Method Man, puttin' in work, foot in the dirt
Like it's all good, roll through your hood, pushin' a hearse
I wish y'all would come around like Clint Eastwood
As if you're reppin' your hood in my neck of the woods
Street gorillas in the PJ's, grimy bitch
I wear the same shit for three days, find me lit
Blunt sparks, like Phillippi; fuck the he-say, the she-say!
Adjust the microphone, plus the cliché

[Verse 4: Redman]
Yo, call me the Bob Backlund
I'll break backs on hoes that look like Toni Braxton
Come run with these boney masked men
I'm out the gutter, I'm out to send your baby mother
Out for rubbers; we fuckin' tonight
Bitches wanna crowd around, how I'm cuffin' the mic
I'm a gorilla, leave a banana stuck in your pipe
‘Cause I'm a real block winner, the Doc inna
Bitch, one of my balls bigger than the Epcot Center!

[Hook: Toni Braxton + Method Man & Redman]
I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get

Lyrics:
[Intro: Redman + Method Man]
Yo, ladies and gentlemen
We got Toni Braxton up in the house
So high that I can kiss the sky, bitch
We live up in here, y'all; let's get high!
Motherfucker, get high!

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Tical shittin' again, spittin' to win
Loaded guns, clip in the end, none sicker than him
Yes, indeed, I'm ill as any STD's or sex disease
These dirty rats want extra cheese
On that piece of the pie
Now ask me ""How high?"", I'll tell you ""Reach for the sky!""

Blame the Crooked Letter I
That's my home, 23's wrapped in chrome
Not only snap on y'all niggas but I'll snap them bones
Clap your dome, make you leave that crack alone
You got the key to the city but the latch is on?
I gots it locked, bringin' the noise, bringin' the Funk
Doctor Spock, bringin' my boys, bringin' you lungs
Pop the Glock, but only if you feel this shit
Jack the Ripper; don't make me have to kill this bitch!
Back to get ya, put it in check, that's the Mista
Meth with his wood on your neck, shut your lips up

[Hook: Toni Braxton + Method Man & Redman]
I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get

[Verse 2: Redman]
You can call on the man when the party is borin'
I'll have these hoes strippin' till it's part of the mornin'
I love a fat chick with a body enormous
It ain't about the weight, yo, it's how they performin'
My dash is 180, my weed half a pound
When the smoke in the air my nose like basset hounds
I don't stash the 'dro, nigga, divide
I'm that nigga that ride with trigger to give a supply
High is how I stay all the time
(Method Man: Niggas, close your doors!)
Yo, bitches, shut all your blinds!
If I'm hard to find, take two puffs and pass
I stay back, but my Benz moved up a class
It's Doc and Meth, the format is real sickenin'
Contagious, we out for Mr. Biggs' women
You better shut your trap when my dogs around
We pissin' on fire hydrants, so walk around, bitch!

[Hook: Toni Braxton + Method Man & Redman]
I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Mista Method Man, puttin' in work, foot in the dirt
Like it's all good, roll through your hood, pushin' a hearse
I wish y'all would come around like Clint Eastwood
As if you're reppin' your hood in my neck of the woods
Street gorillas in the PJ's, grimy bitch
I wear the same shit for three days, find me lit
Blunt sparks, like Phillippi; fuck the he-say, the she-say!
Adjust the microphone, plus the cliché

[Verse 4: Redman]
Yo, call me the Bob Backlund
I'll break backs on hoes that look like Toni Braxton
Come run with these boney masked men
I'm out the gutter, I'm out to send your baby mother
Out for rubbers; we fuckin' tonight
Bitches wanna crowd around, how I'm cuffin' the mic
I'm a gorilla, leave a banana stuck in your pipe
‘Cause I'm a real block winner, the Doc inna
Bitch, one of my balls bigger than the Epcot Center!

[Hook: Toni Braxton + Method Man & Redman]
I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get

Bir gün dönüp bakınca 
Düşler içmiş olursa yudum yudum yıllarını
Ağla ağla Firuze, ağla 
Anlat,
Bir zaman ne dayanılmaz güzellikte olduğunu

Kıskanır rengini baharda yeşiller
Sevda büyüsü gibisin sen Firuze
Sen nazlı bir çiçek 
Bir orman kuytusu
Üzüm buğusu gibisin sen Firuze

Duru bir su gibi 
Bazen volkan gibi
Bazen bir deli rüzgar gibi
Gözlerinde telaş
Yıllar sence yavaş
Acelen ne, bekle Firuze

Acılı bir bakış yerleşirse eğer
Kirpiğinin ucundan göz bebeğine
Her şeyin bedeli var, güzelliğinin de
Bir gün gelir ödenir 
Öde Firuze

Vazgeçmek zor senin o büyülü tuhaf sıcağından
Dön demeye utanırım zavallı korkularımla
Arkasına saklandığım gururumdan

Geri dön geri dön, ne olur geri dön
Uzanıp tutuver elimi bir gün
Utanır diyemem ne olur geri dön

Olur da bir gün sen de özlersen
Olur da bir gün sen de 
Gözlerimle buluşmayı istersen
Uzanıp tutuver elimi bir gün
Utanır diyemem ne olur geri dön

Her şey bana seni hatırlatır unutmak isterken
Utanırım hep o acılı şarkılarla ağlarken
Bazen bir dost ya da bazen bir çiçekle 
Evime gelirsin
Her şey seni hatırlatır da yeniden

Geri dön geri dön, ne olur geri dön
Uzanıp tutuver elimi bir gün
Utanır diyemem ne olur geri dön

Şimdi artık gözyaşları gereksiz akmamalı
Alışmalı kendi yaramızı kendimiz sarmaya

Şimdi artık kelimeler yetersiz anlamı yok
Yitirmişiz anılarla beraber faydası yok
Gel bunları bırakalım artık bir tarafa
Gerçeği görmeliyiz dostum başka çaresi yok

Şimdi bana kaybolan yıllarımı verseler
Şimdi bana seninle bir ömür vadetseler
Şimdi bana ""yeniden ister misin"" deseler
Tek bir söz bile söylemeye hakkım yok

Yönetmen: Umur Turagay
Söz-Müzik: Sezen Aksu

Unuttun mu beni, her şeyimi
Sildin mi bütün izlerimi
Hiç düşmedim mi aklına
Hiç çalmadı mı o şarkı
O sahil, o ev, o ada
O kırlangıç da mı küs bana

Sanırdım ki aşklar ancak
Filmlerde böyle...

Ben hâlâ dolaşıyorum avare
Hani görsen, enikonu divane
Ne yaptıysam olmadı, ne çare
Unutamadım, gitti!

Ey aşk! Neredesin şimdi
Sen de mi terk ettin beni
Ne hata ettiysem, affet!
Büyüklük sende kalsın, e mi
Sen de olmazsan eğer,
Batar artık bu gemi
 
Ben hâlâ dolaşıyorum avare
Hani görsen, enikonu divane
Ne yaptıysam olmadı, ne çare
Unutamadım, gitti!

Vurgun yemiş misali gönlüm tutuldu aşka 
Ciğerimden yanıyorum ben bu defa başka
Bu yangın benle ölünceye dek yaşasın varsın
Dünyanın o son günü sen beni arayacaksın 

Doymadım doyamadım sevmelere seni ben
Kimseyi koyamadım yerine yeniden 
Saymadım sayamadım sensiz geçen yılları 
Ne inkar ne itiraf bu yalnızca sitem

Zannetme bir gün geri dönmek değil niyetim ah
Hasrete teslim oldum asla gelmeyeceğim

Bende zincirlere sığmayan o deli sevdalardan
Kızgın çöllerde rastlanmayan büyülü rüyalardan
Kolay kolay taşınmayan dolu dizgin duygulardan
Yalanlardan, dolanlardan daha güçlü bir yürek var

Haydi gel benimle ol, oturup yıldızlardan
Bakalım dünyadaki neslimize
Orada ki sevgililer, özenip birer birer
Gün olur erişirler ikimize

Uzanıp yüreğimin ateşiyle yeniden
Yıldızları tek tek yakacağım
Sarılıp güneşlere sevgimize göklerde
Mavi mavi taçlar takacağım, ne olursun

Haydi gel benimle ol, oturup yıldızlardan
Bakalım dünyadaki neslimize
Orada ki sevgililer özenip birer birer
Gün olur erişirler ikimize

Düzenleme : Aytuğ Yargıç
Video Prodüksiyon: Videomite

Benden çekiniyormuşsun
Bana göre değil hiç diyormuşsun
Çok baskın çok iddialı
Fazla popüler buluyormuşsun

Peki benim de bir kalbim olduğunu
Senin aşkınla dolduğunu
Göz göze gelince mahvolduğumu
Gerçekten mi görmüyorsun?

Sabredemiyorsun
Fark edemiyorsun
Hissedemiyorsun
Garanticisin, korkuyorsun

Gerçeği gözden kaçıran yârim
Eğriyi doğruyu şaşıran yârim
Aşkımla ruhunu şad ederken
Sonunda sabrımı taşıran yârim

Seni anlamıyor değilim inan ki
Yaşamak değil esaret sanki
Hadi benim kendi seçimim sonuçta
Gülü seven dikenine dayanır yani

Bu durumda kalbine danışacaksın
Neye nereye kadar katlanacaksın
O kadar aşkın varsa hemen gel
Kalbimde karargah kuracaksın

Sabredemiyorsun
Fark edemiyorsun
Hissedemiyorsun
Garanticisin, korkuyorsun

Gerçeği gözden geçiren yârim
Eğriyi doğruyu şaşıran yârim
Aşkımla ruhunu şad ederken
Sonunda sabrımı taşıran yârim

Görünüşüme bakıp da 
Sen beni sakın ha
Cin fikirli sanma
Hani yağmasan da 
Gürle benim durumum
Çalımıma aldanma
Okurum, yazarım, konuşurum
Kelimelerin efendisiyim amma
Aşka gelince enikonu safım
Sen şanıma inanma

Lyrics: 

Oh you turn off to the other side
When I stare at you
Oh you close your eyes so I won't see them
Oh yes you do

Everyday, even without blinking
You stare at your invisible God
But why are you ignoring me
When I'm in front of you?

Choope Bangaramayene Srivalli
Maate Manikyamayene
Choope Bangaramayene Srivalli
Navve Navaratnamayene

Oh look at me, every time, always
I used to be leading
Now I'm following you everywhere that you go
Oh look at me, never did I ever bend my head for anyone
Now I'm bending my whole body, so I can see your anklet

After living such a great life
I'm now doing everything I can
For me it's enough, 
if only for a second you look at me

Choope Bangaramayene Srivalli
Maate Manikyamayene
Choope Bangaramayene Srivalli
Navve Navaratnamayene

Lyrics: 

Oh you turn off to the other side
When I stare at you
Oh you close your eyes so I won't see them
Oh yes you do

Everyday, even without blinking
You stare at your invisible God
But why are you ignoring me
When I'm in front of you?

Choope Bangaramayene Srivalli
Maate Manikyamayene
Choope Bangaramayene Srivalli
Navve Navaratnamayene

Oh look at me, every time, always
I used to be leading
Now I'm following you everywhere that you go
Oh look at me, never did I ever bend my head for anyone
Now I'm bending my whole body, so I can see your anklet

After living such a great life
I'm now doing everything I can
For me it's enough, 
if only for a second you look at me

Choope Bangaramayene Srivalli
Maate Manikyamayene
Choope Bangaramayene Srivalli
Navve Navaratnamayene

""Lo/Hi""
Out on a limb
In the wind of a hurricane
Down at the bar
Like a star in the howlin' rain

Nobody to love you
Nobody to care
If you got nobody to hug you
No one to answer your prayer

You get low, like a valley
Then high, like a bird in the sky
You get low, cause you're angry
Low high, high low

One at a time
Get in line for the masquerade
Drink till you cry
And you're lying in the mess you made

Nobody to love you
Nobody to care
Nobody to drug you
No one to hold back your hair

You get low, like a valley
Then high, like a bird in the sky
You get low, cause you're angry
Low high, high low

You get low, Like a valley
Then high, like a bird in the sky
You get low, cause you're angry
Low high, high low
Low high, high low
Low high, high low

Lyrics:

Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well, I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool

My muñequita,
My Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove, yeah.

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth, yeah.

Lyrics:

Maria Maria 
She reminds me of a west side story 
Growing up in Spanish Harlem 
She's living the life just like a movie star 
Maria Maria 
She fell in love in East L.A. 
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah 
Played by Carlos Santana 
Stop the looting, stop the shooting 
Pick pocking on the corner 
See as the rich is getting richer 
The poor is getting poorer 
Se mira Maria on the corner 
Thinking of ways to make it better 
In my mailbox there's an eviction letter 
Somebody just said see you later

Lyrics:

Esa mujer me esta matando 
Por mas que trato de olvidarla 
Me a espinado el corazon 
Mi alma no da razon 
Mi corazon aplastado 
Herido y abandonado 
A ver a ver tu sabes dime mi amor por favor 
Que dolor nos quedo 
Ah ah ah corazon espinado 
Ah ah ah como me duele el amor 
Como duele como duele el corazon 
Cuando nostiene entregados 
Pero no olvides mujer que algun dia diras 
Hay ya yay como me duele el amor 
Como me duele el olvido 
Como duele el corazon 
Como me duele estar vivo 
Sin tenerte aun lado amor 
Corazon espinado""

Lyrics:

Tell me just what you want me to be
One kiss and boom you're the only one for me
So please tell me why don't you come around no more
Cause right now I'm crying outside the door of your candy store

It just takes a little bit of this
A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain
I'm telling you, my babe
It's all in the game of love",True,True,65691488.0,rock and roll

Lyrics:

Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell,
It was love from above, that could save me from hell,
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see,
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me,
There were drums in the air as she started to dance,
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands,
And we sang...

Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay,
And the voices rang like the angels sing,
We're singing...
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay,
And we danced on into the night,
Ay oh ay oh,
Ay oh ay oh,
And we danced on into the night.",True,True,55397419.0,music of Latin America

Lyrics:

You got me runnin' goin' out of my mind,
You got me thinkin' that I'm wastin' my time.
Don't bring me down, no no no no no,
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down.

You wanna stay out with your fancy friends.
I'm tellin' you it's got to be the end,
Don't bring me down, no no no no no no no no,
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down.

Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down, groos

It's like magic
Rollin' and ridin' and slippin' & slidin'

Lyrics:

It was 9-29,9-29 back street big city.
The sun was going' down,there was music all around
It felt so right.

It was one of those nights,one of those nights when
you feel the world stop turnin',you were standing
There,there was music in the air.I should have been
Away,but I knew I'd have to stay.

Last train to London,just leavin' town.
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you.

Lyrics:

Hold on tight to your dream
Hold on tight to your dream
When you see your ship go sailing
When you feel your heart is breaking
Hold tight to your dream.

It's a long time to be gone
Time just rolls on and on
When you need a shoulder to cry on
When you get so sick of trying
Just hold tight to your dream

When you get so down that you can't get up
And you want so much but you're all out of luck
When you're so downhearted and misunderstood
Just over & over & over you could",True,True,38672908.0,progressive rock

Lyrics:
Purple Haze all in my brain,
lately things don't seem the same,
actin' funny but I don't know why
'scuse me while I kiss the sky.
Purple Haze all around,
don't know if I'm coming up or down.
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me.",True,True,285082058.0,hard rock

Lyrics:

So what am I fighting for
Everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go
I’m ready to settle the score
Get ready cause this is war.


There are days that I think I’m crazy
Other days nothing seems to faze me.
There’s nothing more and nothing less just
All the fears that I must confess well
I’m afraid I believe in nothing.

No hopes or dreams you could’ve left me dead.
Naive and not to mention
I’m losing count of all my blessings.

With all that I’ve done, it’s too late
I can’t take back all that I have become.

So all that I’m trying to say
I’m looking for a better way
Some days it just gets so hard
And I don’t wanna slip away.

So what am I fighting for?
Everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go
I’m ready to settle the score
Get ready cause this is war.

Another day in the right direction
I’m ok but I’m left to question
How did I get so far behind the rest?
Why am I so inclined to forget?
All the days that you made me crazy
Nowadays you don’t even faze me
It’s all the same and I don’t stress none
Sick and tired of all this tension

With all that I’ve done, it’s too late I can’t take
Back all that I have become

So all that I’m trying to say
I’m looking for a better way
Some days it just gets so hard
And I don’t wanna slip away.

So what am I fighting for?
Everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go
I’m ready to settle the score
Get ready cause this is war.
I’m looking for a better way
Somedays it just gets so hard
And I don’t wanna slip away
Get ready cause this is war.

Everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go
I’m ready to settle the score
Get ready cause this is war.

#TommyBoyRecords #RIPCoolio
 
************************************
Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Coolio]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light
[Hook 1: LV]
Been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
[Verse 2: Coolio]
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies are down, so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, will I live to see 24?
The way things is going I don't know
[Hook 2: LV]
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
[Hook 1]
Been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
[Verse 3: Coolio]
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't lookin'
It's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front; that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!
[Hook 1]
Been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
[Hook 2]
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Lyrics:
Come on y'all let's take a ride
Don't ya say a word just get inside
It's time to take your a** on another kind of trip
'Cause you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip

Grab your g** with the extra c*** and,
Close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it
Kick it, kick it, yeah... that's the ticket
Ain't no bloodin', ain't no cripin'
Ain't no fools and the party's set trippin'
Everybody's got a stack and it ain't no crack
And it really don't matter if you're white or black, I
Want to take you there like the Staple Singers
Put something in the tank and I know that I can bring ya
If you can't take the heat get yo' a** out the kitchen
We're on a mission
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
With switches on the block in a '65
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide who-ride
Ain't no valley low enough for mountain high
I'm tryin' to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice, a
Place where my kids can play outside
Without livin' in fear of a drive-by
And even if I get away from them drive-by sluggers
I still got to worry about those s******************
I keep on searching and I keep on looking
But fools are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be acting like they evil
You don't understand about runnin' with a gang
'Cause you don't gang bang, and
You don't have to stand on the corner and slang
'Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left
Come along and ride on a fantasic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
I do what I do just to survive
Come along and ride on a fantasic voyage
Slide slide who-ride
That's why I pack my ***
Life is a trip and then you die
Still tryin' to get a peace of the apple pie
Every game ain't the same, coz the game still remains
Don't it seem kinda strange, ain't a damn thing change
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down ******** can ride with me
Hop-hop-hop your five quickly down the block
Stay sucka-free and keep the busters off your jock
You gotta have heart son, if you want to go,
Watch this sweet chariot swing low
Ain´t nobody cryin' ain´t nobody dyin
Ain´t nobody worried, everybody´s tryin
Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
If you want to have something, you better start frontin'
What ya gonna do when the 5 roll by
You better be ready, so you can ride
Come along and ride on a fantasic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
When you're living in a city it's do or die
Come along and ride on a fantasic voyage
Slide slide who-ride
You better be ready when the 5 roll by
Just roll along- that's what you do
Just roll along- that's right
Just roll along- that's what you do
Just roll along- that's right
Do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me
Do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me
Do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me
Do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me

Lyrics:
Now I've seen places and faces
And things you ain't never thought about thinkin'
If you ain't peeped then you must be drinkin' and smokin'
Pretending that you're loc'in but you're broken, let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life
And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy, cause, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya, I know I can't trust ya
Cause my crew is rollin' homers and your crew is rollin' dusters
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more
Uh, I guess that's just the way it goes
I ain't tryin' to preach, I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared, I'll see you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
More temptation than faith, I guess we livin' for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet, by a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin' lifted
I'm just tryin' to take care of my kids and handle my business
Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin'
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Some of us gotta run a little faster cause we gotta lay the struggle
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
If everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter your rag color, deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time, somebody up there still love us
I'm a scuffle and struggle until I'm breathless and weak
I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there with muted sounds bumpin'
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
You need to loosen up and live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin'
For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryin' stack
And keep up with the Joneses, takin' advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut till it's right
When there's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if you're poor and righteous
I know times seem strife, and problems seem endless
But at the times of despair we gotta put ourselves together
And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it
Cause nothing worse than a quitter
you gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lie down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big
I guess I'll see you when you see me
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
I'll see you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

#TommyBoyRecords #HipHop #Coolio
[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Fuck all these niggas
You know what I'm talkin' about Wino
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Two minutes and twenty-one seconds of funk
And I ain't no punk
That's right, that's right

[Verse]
A tisket a tasket
That's all you ask it
Snap your cd and drop the pieces in your casket
Like little Jack Horna', I'm still bendin' cornas'
Buckin' shots on your block, I'm sippin' on Corona's
Uh, your McDonald had a farm wit' a six-fo on suicide
Sittin' in the barn wit' no alarm
Straight up collected it, cool and calm
Crowbar in my hand and my skeleton brick still works like a charm
Who's the rawest?
My shit is flawless
Had to be passin' out bruises
Lacerations and broken jawses
Emcees wanna floss you better understand who's the boss
Before I do a Michael Jackson and ""Cut your shit off!""
Part of the penitentary still, penetratin' your grill
I keep on keepin' it right, while you keep on keepin' it real
I'll bring the treble and the bass to delapatate your waist
Coolio's on the case, get yo ho out my face, fool
Lodi Dodi, I don't know karate, but I know ka-razor
And none of y'all can't fade me
I know you wanna try to play me
And busta's wanna playa hate me
I'm one of the dopest niggas out I
Guess that's why they hate me
Cause I slang hits like niggas slang cavi
I remain like khakis, I guess that's why they mad at me
On a record you might outgat me
But you can't outrap me
My shit is fatta'
And yo shit need a little bit mo batta'
Freestyle in unrestricted manner or method
Free funk text readily selected, so check it
Uh, dip diver, socializer, I've been rockin'
These motherfuckin' microphones since nineteen seventy-niner
And by the time that this little nappy head nigga retire
I'ma be at the ripe ol' age of forty-eight or forty-niner
My shit is wise, CPT M.C. for hire
My name ain't Rick James but I'll burn your ass with a fire
So, what's your desire baby love?
Is it hands wrapped around mics
Or fingers wrapped around triggas?
Eitha' way it go I'm dumpin' and I'm dippin'
Still tennis shoe pimpin', 40 Thevz in position
Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum, now nigga I'm a giant
And yo ass is like Jack
But yo magic beans is wack
Skills is what you lack
I'm like a Benz, you ain't even like Cadillac
You mo like a Regal
I'ma pit bull, and you's a Beagle
I'm set to strangle hangin' emcee's at all angles
As their legs start to dangle
Dance around everybody like Mr. Bo Jangles
Los Angeles, Compton, Long Beach, and Carson Hawthorne
Livin with the Watts
I'm sendin' out shout outs
I used to drink Ol' Gold
Now I just stroll
Straight to the X.O. section of my neighborhood liquor store
Huh, and you know what make me laugh, bitch?
Even your mama want my autograph, autograph, autograph
Autograph, autograph

Lyrics:
1-2-3-4 Get your woman on the floor
Gotta gotta get up to get down
Gotta gotta get up to get down
What up everybody so glad you're here
It's Coolio with the flow back in your ear
This ain't a fantastic voyage
But I'm still on a mission to see if I can
Get your attention
Now I want drops some information
Just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600-watt AMP. 18s in the trunk
When I'm on the streets ya gotta feel my beats
So throw your hands up if you're down with the C
Double O-L-I-O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party so let a brother know
1-2-3-4 it's like A-B-C if hip-hop didn't pay
I'd rap for free
Slide Slide but that's the past
I gotta sumpin' brand new for that ass
1-2-3-4 Get your woman on the floor
Gotta gotta get up to get down
Gotta gotta get up to get down
1-2-3-4 Get your woman on the floor
Gotta gotta get up to get down
Gotta gotta get up to get down
If ya got beef then fool eat a pork chop
Once I get it goin' ya know it don't stop
I brake like anti-locks panties drop
From hood to hood block to block
Help I need somebody
To get it goin' on in the party
Baby you can do it take your time do it right
We can drink some yak and do it all damn night
My name ain't Wanda but I'll rock your world
I get more bounce than a Jherry Curl
Too many lookie-loos be lookin' for clues
There's a party goin' on now whatcha gonna do
So grab your partner do-see-do
If you done know who it is it's Coolio
Slide Slide but that's the past
I gotta sumpin' brand new for that ass
1-2-3-4 Get your woman on the floor
Gotta gotta get up to get down
Gotta gotta get up to get down
1-2-3-4 Get your woman on the floor
Gotta gotta get up to get down
Gotta gotta get up to get down
Push, push in the bush
But don't step on the toes 'cause you might get smushed
It's the brother from around the way
And what I say I'm in the corner on three like Dr. Dre
Comin' at 'em with a pattern and a fresh pair adams
I hope he don't trip, 'cause
I don't wanna have to gat 'em
So move your body, baby, drive the homies crazy
Then when you sake that ass it's always amazin'
Ain't no party like a west coast party
'Cause a west coast party don't stop
So when you see a young n****
In a Chevy hittin' switches
Then ya gotta give a n**** his props
I got sides in my rides and motion for your ocean
Coolio got the potion to get the party open
Slide Slide but that's the past
I gotta sumpin' brand new for that ass
1-2-3-4 Get your woman on the floor
Gotta gotta get up to get down
Gotta gotta get up to get down
1-2-3-4 Get your woman on the floor
Gotta gotta get up to get down
Gotta gotta get up to get down

************************************

Lyrics:
[Verse One: Coolio]

Seven in the morning, standing in the line
Three fools in front of me, drinking on some wine
Two in the back of me, sucking on a joint
And one in back of them, begging for a newport
There's 4-5 suckers way way in the back
Stooped down low in the crowd smokin' crack
They looking at me funny coz I got a record out
And a nigga with a record out I supposed to have some clout
A fourth of the people in the line need help
But the other fourth of that haven't helped they'self
A fourth of the people haven't been fed
And all of the rest are fucked up in the head
A bald headed stank bitch is about to make me laugh
And a nigga who need a bath is asking for my autograph
Ain't nothing changed but the time
I got to get mine, so I'm standing in the county line
[Hook: Coolio]
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Coz it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
You got to have a car in this land of milk and honey

[Verse Two: Coolio]
I walked through the front door, fill out my app
Here comes another sap asking if I rap
I don't say a word coz he know that I do
I'm down with the MAAD ass U know Hoo!
I take a number and a seat
I'm sweating from the heat
Somebody got their shoes off
I smell they feet
My number is 80, it's still on 20
I look up at the clock and now IS 10:30
Free butter and cheese oh please, oh please
Can I get my food stamps so I can leave
I got money and a car but they don't really know it
Now they ask a gang of questions coz I told them I was homeless
I'm living in a car drive back in the alley
But I use to shack up with a hooker named Sally
Line after line
Ruff is the time
My life is in a bind
So I'm standing in the county line
Chorus
[Verse Three: Coolio]
I'm sittin' at a desk talking to a social worker
She thinks I'm a fool but I know that I can jerk her
-Punk ass ho' sittin' behind the window all toe up ass tramp
Runnin that ol' weak shit talkin bout
""You have a penetentry record""
-I said I know that BIATCH!
She wants to know what kind a work do I do
I said I haven't worked since 1982
I can't find a job though I looked and I've looked
Took one hit of the crack and was hooked
She sittin there wondering when i'll get the point
And the whole time I'mma wishing I can smoke me a joint
Job search worker project fat-necks
And in a few weeks I'd get my check
Now I got to wait for them to call me through the window
So I can get a voucher for the hotel and the bathshow
It's 5:13 by the clock on the wall
Mothafuckez move so I can make a phonecall
Shit's getting nutty and times is 29
That why so many niggas just standing in the county line
Chorus 2X to fade

Lyrics:
What you gonna play now
Get on up. Get on up. Get on up. Get on up

Every geto got a different name, but they all the same
So Coolio loco gonna put you up on game
We got homies who sell straps
Homies who sell crack
Homies who sell the bomb chronic sacks and fat dubs
Giving the neighborhood niggas love
Pimps, players, suckers, hoes, forty thieves, gangstas, and thugs
Two hoodrats be scrapping over who knows what
The loudmouth one loced up in front of the icecream truck
And broke all of her lee nails where the big G's live
The little homie be gettin' out on count
This time he might get stuck attempted
One eight seven and he's a minor with priors
So the DA want him tried as an adult
The big homey just had a son no joking
I think his baby's mom is smoking cause she always broke
And the young girls is dressing more and more sleazy
And everybody and their momma talking bout OJ defense

To the hoochies in the Hondas and Sentras
Young niggas fightin' their case with public defenders
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites
To the niggas who smokin' indo chocolate tired of stress
Niggas who got warrants out for their arrest
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites

Slap boxin' with all the young hoochies watchin'
Dead cats in the street playing craps
Niggas catchin dice with they feet
Think they got the funk that one fool got stoked out
Cos he's a mark with a gun
The nosy bitch up the street called 9-1-1 now
One time his d jacked a nigga and old bitch
Licence and registration
""All I got is a drivers permit""
Niggas can't have shit we got dogs that rip but don't even trip
Welcome to Southern California
Liquor stores and churches on every other corner
Your little brother plays pop warner
Narcs raided the dope spot
Eight year old kid got shot cos they mistook his BB gun for a Glock
And I ain't forgot about the homey Lano
He got killed by a sucker way back in the eighties oh
I heard the homies mighties is ballin' out of state
He got himself off unemployment checks in Section 8

Hey the homiez kickin' it real
Yeh I hear what he's sayin' loc
Sometimes it's just like that in the hood
Yeh don't nothin' change of the game but the name
That's right you know that's right

To the young hustlers that's trying to stack that knot up
The house parties that's gonna always get shot up
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites
Community programs to stop the violence
All the niggas who loced up during the L.A. riots
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites

The nigga with all 16 switches sitting On D's
Who got jacked he tried to pull out his gat
Bullets exit through his back
Now his momma in all black
And niggas is going to the barber to get a fade
They carried their dead homey to his grave
Pour out a little liquor
Homegirl down the street with the green eyes and big titties is getting
Thicker
Neighborhood clubs beat him up and crackheads be selling tvs and vcrs
For forty bucks so what's up
Yesterday the homey committed a bank caper
Saw the chase on the news and read the story in today's paper
His little girl's just now taking training wheels off her bike
While her daddy's got twenty-five to life at Fort Strike
The little homey just tripped and stripped
Because he didn't realize that the joint was dipped
That's right
OG's joining the nation and it's all good
B.G's is retaliating cause they enemies done crossed out they hood

Crackhead momma's smoking whole accounting checks
Dopedealers who serve liquor pieces for sex
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites
Young niggas going to school to be a doctor
Late night sounds of gunshots and helicopters
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites

To all the motherfuckers who think their shit don't stank
Rollin' on Ds and then appear for robbing banks
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites
This is just a little something for a nigga
That's still gonna be a nigga if he don't get no bigger
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites

Get on up. Get on up. Get on up. Get on up

Get on up. Get on up. Get on up. Get on up

WE’LL BE BACK
The timing is right to exact my revenge
Spilling enemy blood, I will fight to the end
No more lying-in wait, just to even the score
There’s a price to be paid, now it’s time for war

I’m a soldier of fortune, of torture, and pain
I bash in your skull until no teeth remain
A ‘most-deadly’ weapon, pulverizing your head
With each crushing blow, how you wish you were dead

Just when you think it’s safe, I attack; we’ll be back
When you least expect your fate; I attack; we’ll be back
A kick to your face, one move, big mistake; we’ll be back
Let down your guard, full-on frontal attack, I’ll be back!

No use screaming for mercy, no use makin’ a sound
Still, you step right up, and get smacked back down
In the heat of battle, blood congeals on the floor
Another life-force bleeds out, another soul out the door

Antisocial, sadistic; the “Deity of War”
I stuff body bags, and I’m packing the morgue
No time for remorse over unclaimed remains

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Oh! Hola!

[Verse 1]
Darling, you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
If you say that you are mine
I'll be here 'till the end of time
So you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

[Verse 2]
It's always tease, tease, tease
You're happy when I'm on my knees
One day it's fine and next it's black
So if you want me off your back
Well, come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

[Chorus]
Should I stay or should I go now?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go, there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double
So come on and let me know

[Verse 3]
This indecision's bugging me (Esta indecisión me molesta)
If you don't want me, set me free (Si no me quieres, librarme)
Exactly whom I'm supposed to be (Dígame que tengo ser)
Don't you know which clothes even fit me? (Sabes que ropa me ""quedrá""?)
Come on and let me know (Me tienes que decir)
Should I cool it or should I blow? (Me debo ir o quedarme?)
Split

[Chorus]
Should I stay or should I go now? (Yo me enfrío o lo soplo)
Should I stay or should I go now? (Yo me enfrío o lo soplo)
If I go there will be trouble (Si me voy va a haber peligro)
And if I stay it will be double (Si me quedo sera el doble)
So ya gotta let me know (Me tienes que decir)
Should I cool it or should I blow? (Tengo frío por los ojos)
Should I stay or should I go now? (Tengo frío por los ojos)
If I go there will be trouble (Si me voy va haber peligro)
And if I stay it will be double (Si me quedo será el doble)
So ya gotta let me know (Me tienes que decir)
Should I stay or should I go?

Lyrics

London calling to the faraway towns
Now war is declared, and battle come down
London calling to the underworld
Come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls
London calling, now don't look to us
Phoney Beatlemania has bitten the dust
London calling, see we ain't got no swing
Except for the ring of that truncheon thing

The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Meltdown expected, the wheat is growing thin
Engines stop running, but I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning, and I live by the river

London calling to the imitation zone
Forget it brother, you can go it alone
London calling to the zombies of death
Quit holding out, and draw another breath
London calling, and I don't wanna shout
But while we were talking, I saw you nodding out
London calling, see we ain't got no high
Except for that one with the yellowy eyes

The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growing thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning, and I live by the river

The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growing thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning, and I live by the river

The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Meltdown expected, the wheat is growing thin
Engines stop running, but I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning, and I live by the river

London calling to the imitation zone
Forget it brother, you can go it alone
London calling to the zombies of death
Quit holding out, and draw another breath
London calling, and I don't wanna shout
But while we were talking, I saw you nodding out
London calling, see we ain't got no high
Except for that one with the yellowy eyes

The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growing thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning, and I live by the river

The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growing thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning, and I live by the river

Now get this...
London calling, yes, I was there too
And you know what they said? Well, some of it was true!
London calling at the top of the dial
And after all this, won't you give me a smile?
London calling...

I never felt so much alike alike alike alike...",True,True,277262913.0,post-punk

Lyrics

Now the king told the boogie men
You have to let that raga drop
The oil down the desert way
Has been shakin' to the top
The sheik he drove his Cadillac
He went a' cruisnin' down the ville
The muezzin was a' standing
On the radiator grille

The shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
The shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah

By order of the prophet
We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound
But the Bedouin they brought out
The electric camel drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar picking thumb
As soon as the shareef
Had cleared the square
They began to wail

The shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
The shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah

Now over at the temple
Oh! They really pack 'em in
The in crowd say it's cool
To dig this chanting thing
But as the wind changed direction
The temple band took five
The crowd caught a wiff
Of that crazy Casbah jive

The shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
The shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah

The king called up his jet fighters
He said you better earn your pay
Drop your bombs between the minarets
Down the Casbah way

As soon as the shareef was
Chauffeured outta there
The jet pilots tuned to
The cockpit radio blare

As soon as the shareef was
Outta their hair
The jet pilots wailed

The shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
The shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
He thinks it's not kosher
Fundamentally he can't take it.
You know he really hates it.",True,True,266385370.0,punk rock

Lyrics

Say you stand by your man
Tell me something I don't understand
You said you love me and that's a fact
Then you left me, said you felt trapped

Well some things you can explain away
But my heartache's in me till this day

Did you stand by me
No, not at all
Did you stand by me
No way

All the times
When we were close
I'll remember these things the most
I see all my dreams come tumbling down
I won't be happy without you around

So all alone I keep the wolves at bay
There is only one thing that I can say

Did you stand by me
No, not at all
Did you stand by me
No way

You must explain why this must be
Did you lie when you spoke to me

Did you stand by me
No, not at all

Now I got a job
But it don't pay
I need new clothes
I need somewhere to stay
But without all these things I can do
But without your love I won't make it through

But you don't understand my point of view
I suppose there's nothing I can do

Did you stand by me
No, not at all
Did you stand by me
No way

You must explain why this must be
Did you lie when you spoke to me?

Did you stand by me
Did you stand by me
No, not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
Did you stand by me
No, not at all
Did you stand by me

Lyrics

He's in love with rock'n'roll woaahh
He's in love with gettin' stoned woaahh
He's in love with Janie Jones
But he don't like his boring job, no...

An' he knows what he's got to do
So he knows he's gonna have fun with you
You lucky lady!
An' he knows when the evening comes
When his job is done he'll be over in his car for you

An' in the in-tray lots of work
But the boss at the firm always thinks he shirks
But he's just like everyone, he's got a Ford Cortina
That just won't run without fuel
Fill her up, Jacko!

An' the invoice it don't quite fit,
There's no payola in his alphabetical file
This time he's gonna really tell the boss
Gonna really let him know exactly how he feels
It's pretty bad!

Let them know - how you feel",True,True,17773912.0,punk rock

Lyrics

Ring, ring, it's 7:00 A.M.
Move yourself to go again
Cold water in the face
Brings you back to this awful place
Knuckle merchants and your bankers too
Must get up and learn those rules
Weather man and the crazy chief
One says sun and one says sleet
A.M., the F.M. the P.M. too
Churnin' out that boogaloo
Gets you up and it gets you out
But how long can you keep it up?
Gimme Honda, gimme Sony
So cheap and real phony
Hong Kong dollar, Indian cents
English pounds and Eskimo pence
You lot, what?
Don't stop, give it all you got
You lot, what?
Don't stop, yeah
You lot, what?
Don't stop, give it all you got
You lot, what?
Don't stop, yeah
Working for a rise, better my station
Take my baby to sophistication
Seen the ads, she thinks it's nice

Better work hard, I seen the price
Never mind that it's time for the bus
We got to work and you're one of us
Clocks go slow in a place of work
Minutes drag and the hours jerk
Yeah, wave bye, bye
(When can I tell 'em what I do?)
(In a second, maan, alright Chuck)
Wave bub-bub-bub-bye to the boss
It's our profit, it's his loss
But anyway the lunch bells ring
Take one hour, do your thang
Cheeesboiger
What do we have for entertainment?
Cops kickin' gypsies on the pavement
Now the news has snapped to attention
Lunar landing of the dentist convention
Italian mobster shoots a lobster
Seafood restaurant gets out of hand
A car in the fridge, a fridge in the car
Like cowboys do in TV land
You lot, what?
Don't stop, give it all you got
You lot, what?
Don't stop, huh
You lot, what?
Don't stop, give it all you got, yeah
You lot, what?
Don't stop
So get back to work and sweat some more
The sun will sink and we'll get out the door
It's no good for man to work in cages
Hit the town, he drinks his wages
You're frettin', you're sweatin'
But did you notice, you ain't gettin'
You're frettin', you're sweatin'
But did you notice, not gettin' anywhere
Don't you ever stop, a long enough to start
Take your car outta that gear
Don't you ever stop, long enough to start
Get your car outta that gear
Karlo Marx and Frederick Engels
Came to the checkout at the seven on eleven
Marx was skint but he had sense
Engels lent him the necessary pence
What have we got? Yeah, ooh
What have we got? Yeah, ooh
What have we got? Magnificence
What have we got?
Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi
Went to the park to check on the game
But they was murdered by the other team
Who went on to win fifty-nil
You can be true, you can be false
You'll be given the same reward
Socrates and Milhous Nixon
Both went the same way through the kitchen
Plato the Greek or Rin Tin Tin
Who's more famous to the billion millions?
News flash, 'Vacuum cleaner sucks up budgie'
Ooh, bye-bye, bub-bye",True,True,29839444.0,rock music

Lyrics:
Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come
Watching the ships roll in
And then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah

I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooo, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the 'Frisco bay
'Cause I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothin's gonna come my way

So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes

Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home

Now, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Oooo-wee, sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

The original 1947 version by Johnny Moore's Three Trailblazers (featuring singer/pianist Charles Brown (musician), is the definitive version of this song.

Otis Ray Redding, Jr. (September 9, 1941 – December 10, 1967) was an American singer-songwriter, record producer, arranger, and talent scout. He is considered one of the greatest singers in the history of American popular music and a seminal artist in soul and rhythm and blues. His singing style was powerfully influential among soul artists of 1960s and helped exemplify the Stax sound.

Born and raised in the US state of Georgia, Redding quit school at age 15 to support his family, working with Little Richard's backing band, the Upsetters, and also performing at talent shows for prize money. In 1958, he joined Johnny Jenkins's band, the Pinetoppers, and toured the Southern states as a driver and musician. An unscheduled appearance on a Stax recording session led to a contract and his first single, ""These Arms of Mine,"" in 1962. Stax released Redding's debut album Pain in My Heart two years later.

Initially popular mainly with African Americans, Redding later reached a wider American popular music audience. Along with his group, he first played small gigs in the American South, then performed in the western states at the popular Los Angeles night club Whisky a Go Go. European appearances included London, Paris and other major cities.

After appearing at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, Redding wrote and recorded his iconic ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"" with Steve Cropper. The song became the first posthumous number-one record on both the Billboard Hot 100 and R&B charts after his death in a plane crash. The Dock of the Bay became the first posthumous album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart.

Redding's premature death devastated Stax. Already on the verge of bankruptcy, the label soon discovered that Atlantic Records owned the rights to his entire song catalog.

Redding received many posthumous accolades, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. He received the honorific nickname King of Soul. In addition to ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,"" ""Respect"" and ""Try a Little Tenderness"" are among his best-known songs.
