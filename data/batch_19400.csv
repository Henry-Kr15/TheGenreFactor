LYRICS:

I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone dry bottle of Jack I’s pouring
Damn she got some nerve
Way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
‘Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
 
She said don’t come home if you go to the bar
I said okay baby then got drunk out in the yard
2am I knock knock knocked up on the door
But she never unlock locked it guess I don’t live there no more
 
Yeah she meant business this time
I can’t believe my bloodshot eyes
 
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone dry bottle of Jack I’s pouring
Damn she got some nerve
Way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
‘Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
 
I used that empty bag of corn to rest my head
A camo jacket for a blanket then passed out like I was dead
 
Still got one heck of a buzz
If I look a train wreck it’s because
 
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone dry bottle of Jack I’s pouring
Damn she got some nerve
Way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
‘Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning yeah 
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning, yes I did
 
I can’t believe I gotta be at work at nine
That fuckin’ birds about to catch this 45
Oh I guess if this really is goodbye
At least I took my boots off this time
 
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone dry bottle of Jack I’s pouring
Damn she got some nerve
Way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone dry bottle of Jack I’s pouring
Damn she got some nerve
Way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve

Lyrics:
I Still Got A Shoebox Full Of Money 
Sittin’ At The Top Of My Closet
From Workin’ Like A Dog
Got A Chicken Scratch Notepad 
Of What I Would’ve Said Once I Bought It
Till She Called It Off
Now She’s Picking Out Menus And Venues
And Djs And His Cake And Her Cake
Where The Honeymoon Gonna Be
With A New Dude With Bukoos Of Old Cash
I Swear That’s The Furthest Damn Thing From Me

He Went To Ole Miss I Went To Work
He Pushes Paper I Push The Dirt
He’s Got That Clean Cut Drivin’ In A Clean Truck
I’m Just Sittin’ Here With A Beer And My Jeans Tucked
He’s Tying Cans On The Bumper Of A Car
I’m Tying One On Takin’ It Hard
Thinkin’ Bout I’m There With A White Horse And Carriage
Nearly Three Karats
He Went To Jared I Went To The Bar

I Got My Own Ceremony Going On Right Here In The Neon
With My Best Man Jack
It’ll Be A Meter On A Dash 
Smellin’ Bad Yella Cab Takin’ Me Home
He’ll Be In A Cadillac
On His Ride To The Airline, Saint Lucia 
Next To The Girl I Should Still Be With

He Went To Ole Miss I Went To Work
He Pushes Paper I Push The Dirt
He’s Got That Clean Cut Drivin’ In A Clean Truck
I’m Just Sittin’ Here With A Beer And My Jeans Tucked
He’s Tying Cans On The Bumper Of A Car
I’m Tying One On Takin’ It Hard
Thinkin’ Bout I’m There With A White Horse And Carriage
Nearly Three Karats
He Went To Jared I Went To The Bar

Maybe I’m Drunk 
And It Ain’t That Bad
Cause I Ain’t Into Girls
Into Guys Like That
Hell Nah

He Went To Ole Miss I Went To Work
He Pushes Paper I Push The Dirt
He’s Got That Clean Cut Drivin’ In A Clean Truck
I’m Just Sittin’ Here With A Beer And My Jeans Tucked
He’s Tying Cans On The Bumper Of A Car
I’m Tying One On Takin’ It Hard
Thinkin’ Bout I’m There With A White Horse And Carriage
Nearly Three Karats
He Went To Jared I Went To The Bar

LYRICS:

Hey kid let me introduce myself
I’s a friend of your dad’s when he had no one else
I’ll put the party in your life boy you know I can
Have you ever wanted to feel like superman
 
Oh, Oh
 
I see that blonde hair over there looking at you
You wanna say what’s up but can’t work up the courage to
But if you stick with me buddy you can bet your life
She’ll be walking out with you by the end of the night so
 
Don’t listen to momma
Hell I ain’t the devil
Ditch me when you wanna
But if you need a little
I can fix your problems
Always got your back
I can make you famous
By the way my name is….

Shit
It ain't my place but I gotta admit
 
All the people in your circle man they’re pissing me off
Say you’re broken and you’re soulless and it’s all my fault
So tell me old friend, is it such a sin
All I did was make you happy so to hell with them and

 Don’t listen to momma
Hell I ain’t the devil
Ditch me when you wanna
But if you need a little
I can fix your problems
Always got your back
I can make you famous
By the way my name is….
 
Yeah
Yeah yeah it’s been a hell of a ride kid don’t you agree
Yeah yeah rock bottom ain’t as bad when you’re rocking with me
When you’re rocking with me
So
 
Don’t listen to momma
Hell I ain’t the devil
Ditch me when you wanna
But if you need a little
I can fix your problems
Always got your back
I can make you famous
By the way my name is…. 
By the way my name is…. 
By the way my name is Jack

LYRICS:
Gold records on the sheetrock
Not bad for a boy from Mississippi
Yeah, I could buy a Maybach
But I'm still in my F-150

And my last name
Is a whole lot bigger than I thought it'd be
A lotta things changed
Except one thing, me

I'm still the same old redneck 
Fuck, don't give a damn
Ain't afraid to throw a dead buck on my Instagram
Grain alcohol in my cup
Got the whole house
Wall to wall and I still ain't sold out
Wall to wall and I still ain't sold out
Wall to wall and I still ain't sold out

Middle finger to the sky, buddy that's right
I don't sprinkle Dixie Crystal on my half-time 
Keep your in crowd, I'll be the outcast
I'll be country till I'm dead

That's on my last name
Is a whole lot bigger than I thought it'd be
A lotta things changed
But if there's something you should know about me

I'm still thе same old redneck 
Fuck, don't givе a damn
Ain't afraid to throw a dead buck on my Instagram
Grain alcohol in my cup
Got the whole house
Wall to wall and I still ain't sold out 
Wall to wall and I still ain't sold out
Wall to wall and I still ain't sold out

Middle finger to the sky till I'm gone and dead
.44 in the Ford for the copperheads
Alcohol in my cup
Got the whole house
Wall to wall and I still ain't sold out

Middle finger to the sky till I'm gone and dead
.44 in the Ford for the copperheads
Alcohol in my cup
Got the whole house
Wall to wall and I still ain't sold out

LYRICS:
There’s gotta be a truck
There’s gotta be a girl
She’s gotta be hot and you gotta rhyme that shit with world
And it can’t be too fake but it can’t be too real
Gotta make ‘em tap they’re feet or I’ll lose my record deal
So I just sat down with some dudes that wrote some hits
We put our heads together for a second and it goes like this
 
Baby whatcha think about getting outta here
Get you outta this bar girl get to switching gears
In my Chevy there’s a Yeti in the back with some beer
We can park in the dark, get our dirt road on
Oh
Everybody knows how it goes
Kiss you in the moonlight glow
Sitting shotty everybody sing along
Well this ain’t no radio song
 
Fuck
 
Well if it ain’t under four minutes it ain’t gon’ be a hit
If there ain’t no steel in it they ain’t gon’ play yo shit
And I wish I tell it like it is but the cold hard fact is
I can’t
So bring that money maker back
 
Baby whatcha think about getting outta here
Get you outta this bar girl get to switching gears
In my Chevy there’s a Yeti in the back with some beer
We can park in the dark, get our dirt road on
Oh
Everybody knows how it goes
Kiss you in the moonlight glow
Sitting shotty everybody sing along
Well this ain’t no radio song
 
Fuck

Letra:
Necesito algo pa’ la cabeza 
Es que esa nena ya no me besa
Mezclo la Molly con la cerveza 
Y salgo a ver si la veo
Me tiré al amor sin paracaídas
Saqué el pasaje con viaje sólo de ida
Sé que por mi error me diste salida
Y ahora yo quiero volver a entrar

¿Dónde estás?
Que hoy voy a buscarte 
Para recordarte lo que alguna vez fuimos
¿Y dónde estás? 
Que hoy voy a buscarte 
Para recordarte lo que alguna vez fuimos tú y yo

Éramos uno los dos
Pensé que nada podría matar este amor
Y el que lo mató fui yo
Maldigo ese error, maldito ese ron 
Que me llevó al infierno con la primera diabla que pasó
Y ahora me paso viendo tus stories 
Tu cuerpo no me lo sé de memory
 
¿Dónde estás?
Que hoy voy a buscarte 
Para recordarte lo que alguna vez fuimos
¿Y dónde estás? 
Que hoy voy a buscarte 
Para recordarte lo que alguna vez fuimos tú y yo

Nuestras discusiones 
Fueron el motivo clave para hacer que esto no siga
Te pido que me perdones, que me perdones

¿Dónde estás?
Que hoy voy a buscarte 
Para recordarte lo que alguna vez fuimos
¿Y dónde estás? 
Que hoy voy a buscarte 
Para recordarte lo que alguna vez fuimos tú y yo

Necesito algo pa’ la cabeza 
Es que esa nena ya no me besa
Yo, Khea Young Flex
Snipe 
Argentina en la casa

Lyrics/Letra

Ayer me llamó mi ex
Y me dijo que el novio que tiene ahora es aburrido
Que no puede sentir lo que sentía conmigo
Y yo me hago el duro pero por nada la olvido
Un culito así en eBay no lo consigo
Nos hicimos mal 
Pero también bien
La hacía venir 
Cada dos por tres
Peleábamos y arreglábamos con sex 

Ayer me llamó mi ex
Y me dijo que el novio que tiene ahora es aburrido
Que no puede sentir lo que sentía conmigo
Y yo me hago el duro pero por nada la olvido
Un culito así en eBay no lo consigo
Nos hicimos mal 
Pero también bien
La hacía venir 
Cada dos por tres
Peleábamos y arreglábamos con sex 

Tengo los videos esos que grabábamos
Casi que ni creo lo bien que la pasábamos 
Cuando acapella lo hacíamo´ en el baño
Me soplaba la vela to’ los días mi cumpleaños
Y ahora que no estamos juntos algo me resulta extraño
Sin ti estoy mejor no te voy a meter engaño
Y no puedo negar que tu sexo lo extraño
Pero tu amor me hizo mucho daño

Tatata ratatata
Iba para tu casa y a veces no estabas
Por más que eras mala con lo bueno me quedaba
Son incontables las veces que te perdonaba
Me llamaba tu mamá porque estabas deprimida
No sabía por qué pero yo sí lo sabía
El único que podía sanarte la herida
Baby yo lo sé tú lo sabes todavía

Yeh eh eh eh
Ahora me llama pa' que yo le dé
Yeh eh eh eh
Quiere volver a ser mi mujer 

Yeh eh eh eh
Ahora me llama pa' que yo le dé
Yeh eh eh eh
Quiere volver a ser mi mujer 

Ayer me llamó mi ex
Y me dijo que el novio que tiene ahora es aburrido
Que no puede sentir lo que sentía conmigo
Y yo me hago el duro pero por nada la olvido
Un culito así en eBay no lo consigo
Nos hicimos mal 
Pero también bien
La hacía venir 
Cada dos por tres
Peleábamos y arreglábamos con sex 

Ayer me llamó mi ex
Y me dijo que el novio que tiene ahora es aburrido
Que no puede sentir lo que sentía conmigo
Y yo me hago el duro pero por nada la olvido
Un culito así en eBay no lo consigo
Nos hicimos mal 
Pero también bien
La hacía venir 
Cada dos por tres
Peleábamos y arreglábamos con sex 

Voy a aceptar tu invitación
Hacia tu habitación
Pero no quiero que hables de amor
Quiero en el suelo tu ropa interior
Baby por vos
Cancelé a cupido y le hice fuck love
Le hice fuck love

Yeh eh eh eh
Ahora me llama pa que yo le dé
Yeh eh eh eh
Quiere volver a ser mi mujer 

Yeh eh eh eh
Ahora me llama pa que yo le de
Yeh eh eh eh
Quiere volver a ser mi mujer 

Ayer me llamó mi ex
Y me dijo que el novio que tiene ahora es aburrido
Que no puede sentir lo que sentía conmigo
Y yo me hago el duro pero por nada la olvido
Un culito así en eBay no lo consigo
Nos hicimos mal 
Pero también bien
La hacía venir 
Cada dos por tres
Peleábamos y arreglábamos con sex",False,True,199218922.0,Latin trap

Lyrics

Otra mañana
Sin tu mirada

Cuando te despertabas
Y decías lo mucho que me amabas
Ahora no hay nada
Nada de nada
Ni las canciones que yo a ti te dedicaba
Sé que me equivoqué
Que otra vez fallé
Quisiera detener el tiempo en aquella vez

Cuando te besé
Fuiste mi mujer
Te hice tocar el cielo la llama de Lucifer
Sé que me equivoqué
Que otra vez flashé
Quisiera detener el tiempo en aquella vez
Cuando te besé
Te hice mi mujer

Te hice tocar el cielo la llama de Lucifer
Pasan las horas, los minutos
Y mis ganas de encontrarte
Se hacen más grandes

Yeh

Tu sentimiento diminuto
Que dejó mi amor con hambre
Inaceptable
Lo sé
Siento un vacío dentro de mí
Lo que había ganado lo perdí
Esto no era lo que yo pedí
Sin embargo

Todo me recuerda a ti
Siento un vacío dentro de mí
Lo que había ganado lo perdí
Esto no era lo que yo pedí
Sin embargo
Todo me recuerda a ti",False,True,62737232.0,Not Found

Ryan Castro - JORDAN (Letra):
El cantante del guetto zaga zauu
Desde hace tiempo que no te veo mami
Quiero calmar este deseo
Dime si tú estás puesta pa mi que los enemigos miran feo

Llego a la disco vestido de Jordan
Y la baby se me pega con un Rico splash
Conjunto de Nike y unas Air Force one
Es rapera como yo y le gusta bailar
Ella sabe si la beso lo que puede pasar
El pantisito se le moja y eso no es normal
Después de la disco nos vamos acu shh
Calladito que ninguno se puede enterar
Tentándome como cuando la conocí
Pegadita contra la pared esta noche solo eres pa mi
Tentándome como cuando la conocí
Pegadita contra la pared esta noche solo eres pa mi

Le canto al oído la beso en el cuello
Le apretó las 
Le halo el cabello es una que vive en medallo
Y en ese cuerpito yo deje mi sello
Tenía muchos días sin verte
Y hoy que te tengo de frente
No voy a perder la oportunidad

Llego a la disco vestido de Jordan,
Y la baby se me pega con un Rico splash
Conjunto de Nike y unas Air Force one
Es rapera como yo y le gusta bailar
Ella sabe si la beso lo que puede pasar
El pantisito se le moja y eso no es normal
Después de la disco nos vamos acu shh
Calladito que ninguno se puede enterar
Tentándome como cuando la conocí
Pegadita contra la pared esta noche solo eres pa mi pupupum
Tentándome como cuando la conocí
Pegadita contra la pared esta noche solo eres pa mi pupupum

Dimelo coke esa baby es la sensación del bloque
Dimelo Juank pero los que le tiraron los dejamos en la banca
Beat k-million
Siempre original Gangsta
Dimelo SOG
En cualquier pista le damos
You know what I say
Es el cantante del ghetto mi amor

Llego a la disco vestido de Jordan
Y la baby se me pega con un Rico splash
Conjunto de Nike y unas Air Force one
Es rapera como yo y le gusta bailar
Ella sabe si la beso lo que puede pasar
El pantisito se le moja y eso no es normal
Después de la disco nos vamos acu shh
Calladito que ninguno se puede enterar

Ryan Castro - Malory (Letra):

¡Heyyy!
King Records (Beyyy)
Kapital Music (Yee)
Sabe que le rompo ese Jean
A esa killing
Porque soy el king por ley
Si me la robo toda la noche no hay fin
Como un patin 360 en skate

Y me la robe (eh eh eh eh eh eh)
Contra la pared (eh eh eh eh eh eh)

Me paso por el lado, pero no la vi
Le dicen la mala, mala Malory
Yo no se si es de Bello o es de Itagüí
Solo yo se que quiere pi pi
Primero bailar, trabaja en bigo, cobra por Paypal
Le gusta la liendra, le gusta el chacal
La vida es buena, no me eche la sal
Kapo con SOG, Ryan el capitan

Y me la robe (eh eh eh eh eh eh)
Contra la pared (eh eh eh eh eh eh)
Y me la robe (eh eh eh eh eh eh)
Contra la pared (eh eh eh eh eh eh)

A making Dancehall
Es el Kapo con SOG
Rompelo baby con el cantante del Ghe Ghe
Zaga Zaga Zaga Zagazau
Zaga Zaga Zaga Zagazau
Las verdaderas  de las voces

Y me la robe (eh eh eh eh eh eh)
Contra la pared (eh eh eh eh eh eh)
Y me la robe (eh eh eh eh eh eh)
Contra la pared (eh eh eh eh eh eh)

Letra de Monastery - Ryan Castro, Feid:

CCBeatz y SOG “Los Apa$“

Bajando por palmas de camino pa'l pobla
Le compré unos panty’s, aunque ella no es mi novia
Le canté Lejanía y lo subió a su historia
Le robé un besito y ya mi ex novia la odia

Pero hay niveles de niveles
Aunque a las otras les duele
En los perreos y en los moteles
Entre semana y los weekends
Comiéndote esa cherry
Eso ahí abajito te sabe a blueberry
Cuando yo te quito la combi de Burberry
Tengo par de y una de don Peri (Don perignon)

Baby que tú tienes que me tiene enviciao’
Te quiero sin ropa en mi casa en el poblado (Baby)
Unos tenis Valentino, panty’s Moschino
En Envigado los dos nos conocimos
Dos copas de vino, ella se viste fino
¡Ey! La toqué y se vino

Suena la Ducati y ella baja
A los outfit ella nunca le baja
Hace cardio y el no rebaja
Peligrosa como una navaja
En las redes todas dicen que ella es sata, que ella es
Porque le gusta el 
Le doy a like a tu foto en bicicleta
No quiero un canto, yo te quiero completa
Tengo muchas ganas de volverla a ver como la última vez
Que me fuí de viaje pero la llamé, de ese cuerpo me envicié
Tomando vino y yo Henny
Es exclusiva mi baby
En el pool party me la comí
Trajesito de baño de Monastery

Baby que tú tienes que me tienes enviciao’
Te quiero sin ropa o con el panty pa'l lao’
Unos tenis Valentino, panty’s Moschino
En Envigado los dos nos conocimos
Dos copas de vino, ella se viste fino
¡Ey! La toqué y se vino

Bajando por palmas de camino pa'l pobla
Le compré un carro aunque ella no es mi novia
Le canté Lejanía y lo subió a su historia
Le robé un besito y ya mi ex novia la odia
Pero hay niveles de niveles
De ese tengo papeles
En los PH y los moteles
En la semana y los weekend's

Comiéndote esa cherry
Yo le quité el conjunto de monastery
Ese perfumito tuyo ilmin deli
Tengo un par de y una de don peri (Don Perignon)

Baby que tienes que me tiene enviciao’
Te quiero sin ropa o con el panty pa'l lao’
Unos tenis Valentino, la disco rompimos
En Envigado donde conocimos
Dos copas de vino, ella se viste fino
¡Yeah! La toqué y se vino.

Letra de Mujeriego - Ryan Castro:
King Records
Ladys And Gentleman
Con ustedes Ryan Castro and SOG
Agarren a su pareja y prepárense, una copita de ron

Por culpa de la calle el dinero y el alcohol
Me volví mujeriego, perdóname señor
Ay ay ay soy un mujeriego, ay ay ay yo nunca lo niego
Cuando me robo a una, chao y hasta luego
Ay ay ay me gritan mujeriego

Todas las veo buenas si bebo ron
La blanquita y la morena, si bebo ron
La gordita care tierna, si bebo ron
La flaquita care barbie bailando en el balcón

Ay ay ay soy un mujeriego, ay ay ay yo nunca lo niego
Cuando me robo a una, chao y hasta luego
Ay ay ay me gritan mujeriego

Mujeriego, me gusta vacilar
Mujeriego, yo te saco a bailar
Mujeriego, la vecina esta buena
Mujeriego, yo ya le cogí la vena

Por culpa de la calle el dinero y el alcohol
Me volví mujeriego, perdóname señor
Ay ay ay soy un mujeriego, ay ay ay yo nunca lo niego
Cuando me robo a una, chao y hasta luego
Ay ay ay me gritan mujeriego

Yo la saco a bailar aunque sea mayor que yo
Me la robe en la cuadra y su novio no me vio
Le doy este peluche de traido de niño Dios
Y en Enero de vacaciones pa’ la piedra del peñol

Mujeriego, me gusta vacilar
Mujeriego, yo te saco a bailar
Mujeriego, la vecina esta buena
Mujeriego, yo ya le cogí la vena

Ay Sagrado Rostro SOG, esa sardina esta como buena
Esta la hicimos pa’ que baile las niñas, las señoras, los manes y las tías
Todo el mundo, dime SOG
Ryan Castro, King Castro
El cantante Del Ghetto
Que chimba SOG, jaja
De regalito de navidad
Pa’ que baile todas las niñas y las tías

Letra Marbella - Ryan Castro:

No he podido olvidar las noche' de pasión
Con una tengo sexo y la otra me hace el amor
Estoy envuelto, en dos amore'
Para quererlas a las dos tengo razones
Si alguien me juzga, todo' cometen errores
Maldita tentación, somo' pecadores

Tomando botellas, mirando las estrellas
Contigo o con ella, una noche en Marbella
Yo me la paso bebiendo, en las do' pensando
Y yo aquí muriendo, me estoy enloqueciendo
Yo me la paso bebiendo, en las do' pensando
Y yo aquí muriendo, me estoy enloqueciendo

Yo tengo razone' pa' quererla' a las do'
Si quiere' juzgarme, que me juzgue Dios
Les dedico cancione', les gusta mi voz
Todo fue tan rápido, fue tan veloz

Hacemo' poses diferente', yeah
Y qué rico se siente, eh
Cuando las pongo calientes, yeah
Los gemido' no mienten, eh

¿Quieren satisfacción? Les doy satisfacción
No hay nada malo si hay conexión
Les compro ropa cara si nos vamo' pa'l mall
Pero en mi cama sin ropa interior

Tomando botellas, mirando las estrellas
Contigo o con ella, una noche en Marbella
Yo me la paso bebiendo, en las do' pensando
Y yo aquí muriendo, me estoy enloqueciendo

Yo estaba con ella, pero soñando contigo
Creo que tengo un problema, mis panas son testigos
En la noche no duermo, me siento intranquilo
Y tú qué quiere' juzgarme, si yo no las obligo

Hacemo' poses diferente', yeah
Y qué rico se siente, eh
Cuando las pongo calientes, yeah
Los gemido' no mienten, eh

Tomando botellas, mirando las estrellas
Contigo o con ella, una noche en Marbella
Yo me la paso bebiendo, en las do' pensando
Y yo aquí muriendo, me estoy enloqueciendo

Qué chimba, SOG
Yeah
Es El Cantante del Ghetto
Baby girl
En combination, Onyl

Es una historia que puede suceder en la vida real
Le puede suceder a cualquier persona
Dividir su corazón entre dos amores

Dime, baby, dime, mi amor
Mi baby chula

(RYAN)

Todos los fines de semana bebiendo hasta amanecer 
Granizadito’ en Barrio Antioquía creía que era mi mujer 
yo a ti te conozco de antes, antes que yo fuera cantante 
con ese culo gigante, a ti te gustan los gánster.

Le regale una cadena de diamantes 
me convertí en su NickyJam y le hice Escante 
Cada vez que culeamos me pide que le cante 
empezamos el viernes y terminamos el martes 
ella es una reina de televisión, pero es bandida una Baby de acción 
tiene el culo como RiRi una bandidi está tan buena como la Valdiri 
pon Quien Tv se lo dije a Siri y terminé levantándole la mini

Una peli que no sale ni en tele
Dice que es santa pero ahora quien te ve
Sale un viernes y regresa un jueves
Adicta a la fiesta...

Mira como lo mueve
Una peli que no sale ni en tele
Dice que es santa pero ahora quien te ve
Sale un viernes y regresa un jueves


(BLESSD)

Le gustan las piquis, le gustan las tachas
Y mantiene en fiestas siempre de guaracha
A todos los despacha, nunca se descacha
Valenciana y Gucci siempre es su facha
Se enfoca en su nalga y después va el flash
Todos esos chavos, son del Only Fans
Al culo el cabello, es una pervertida
Y cuando está en cuatro es una melodía (Maaa)

(Coro)
Mira como lo mueve
Una peli que no sale ni en tele
Dice que es santa pero ahora quien te ve
Sale un viernes y regresa un jueves
Adicta a la fiesta...

Mira como lo mueve
Una peli que no sale ni en tele
Dice que es santa pero ahora quien te ve
Sale un viernes y regresa un jueves.

Ryan Castro - Wasa Wasa (Letra)

Dímelo baby, siempre original gangsta
Dímelo Sog

Tú tienes el culo como un Lamborgi
Y estas bien rica como Karol G
Si me dejas yo te toco por detrás
Cuando escuche el tra, Tra, Tra, Tra

Yo soy un perro, pero de raza
Hoy hay noche de entierro, pero en mi casa 
No me digas que no, que eso me atrasa
Esos bobos que te tiran son wasa wasa

No te peines que hoy hay despeluque
Soy el nene de los flow pa´que la compe se eduque
Sog pone la pista, pa´que Castro machuque
Si tienes bellaquera no te preocupes

Que prendan los blones, muevan los mahones
Que estamos haciendo par de millones
El mercedes blanco y pa´ la droga las cone
Las babys se ponen como se supone
Que prendan los blones, muevan los mahones
Que estamos haciendo par de millones
El mercedes blanco y pa´ la droga las cone
Las babys se ponen como se supone

Dime mami si te gusta bailar reggaetón,
Que la noche se presta, vamos hacerlo
Dime mami si te gusta bailar reggaetón,
Que la noche se presta, vamos hacerlo

Raggamuffin killa desde que tenía quince
Esa baby mira como con ojos de lince 
(Me dice que prince)
Pero fuma since
Le gusta la dt, la calima y las quince

Mera actitud
Una hija de la gran pu’
Las amigas calladitas que no dicen ni mu
(Como chicle boobaloo)
Yo me pego a ese cu’
Dime que tu haces 
baby watch I gonna do

Dime mami si te gusta bailar reggaetón,
Que la noche se presta, vamos hacerlo
Dime mami si te gusta bailar reggaetón,
Que la noche se presta, vamos hacerlo

Letra:

Quédate cinco minutos más
Un polvo más nunca está de más
No vaya a ser que te hagan falta besos y tú te arrepientas

Ven báilame mientras que volvemos a hacer el amor 
Soy el fuego que buscas pa’ calentarte 
Por mí es que combinas tu ropa interior

Que rico verte desnuda 
Ese booty es un monumento
Siempre que tenemos sexo quiero que se pare el tiempo

Cuando lo hicimos de nuevo siempre es como la primera vez
Siempre lo entregamos todo 
No hay que guardar nada pa’ después

En la noche recuerdo nuestro primer momento
Cuando te comía y no pasaba el tiempo
Tú bailándome lento tú culo un monumento
Soy el fuego que calienta tu cuerpo

Como gritaba 
A mi me gusta como tu hace el amor 
Aunque tenga varias baby tú eres la mejor
Cuando la conocí fue como un deja vú
Amor a primera vista me hizo Budoo

Terminamos en mi cama y empezamos en el club
Le dedique morena la canción de cabú

Y no sé cómo explicarte lo que hay entre nosotros 
Pero le tengo prohibido que se vaya a ver con otro
Quiero que el mundo sepa que es mío no más ese topo
Y yo sé que sientes lo mismo por mí ya te lo noto
En la forma que me miras, la manera que me besas
Es un rompecabezas y me conozco todas las piezas
Ya sabes que tengo la llave de su joda

Solo que tienes que hacerle participe el pantalón
Yo le quito ese mahon y siempre quedo flechado
Que rico verte cuando amaneces a mi lado 
Siempre se siente como la primera vez 
Buenos días, bebé

Que chimba verte desnuda 
Ese booty es un monumento
Siempre que tenemos sexo quiero que se pare el tiempo
Cuando lo hicimos de nuevo siempre es como la primera vez
Siempre lo entregamos todo 
No hay que guardar nada pa’ después

Me dice devórame que todo eso es tuyo, caliéntame
Y le digo que ahora es que me tienes loco tentándome

Que chimba verte desnuda
Ese booty es un monumento
Siempre que tenemos sexo quiero que se pare el tiempo
Cuando lo hicimos de nuevo siempre es como la primera vez
Siempre lo entregamos todo 
No hay que guardar nada pa’ después

Letra de Ave María - Ryan Castro

Puro clásico de reggaetón
Dime, baby
Qué chimba SOG
Zaga

Estoy haciendo dinero pa' pasar mejores días (Okey)

Un call a los bandido', no a la policía
Tengo un ángel que me guía y que me cuida (Prr, prr, prr)
Si no te pillamo', es porque andas a escondía' (Ey)
Ella mueve el cuerpo al son de la batería (Qué rico)
Tenía un sugar, pero la baby es mía (Ah, se deja ver)
En secreto porque en nadie confía

Bailamos y se enamoró (Qué chimba SOG)
""Nos vamos"", ella me dijo (Yeah, yeah)

Tenemo' la calle en control de los tiempo' que empezó el reggaetón
Bandolero' (Yeah)
Si a tus amigas les gusta bailar pega'o
Perreíto' en casa, los carro' blindao'

Mera chimba, se me pegó (Tra, tra)
No la dejo que baile sola (Yeah)
Con mi huella amaneció (Tra, tra)
Una mamacita en la zona

No sé lo que tiene ella (No sé)
Que me arrebata (Obvio)
Que me mata (Ja, ¡pu-pu-pu!)

Bailamos y se enamoró (Tra)
""Nos vamos"", ella me dijo (Porque en nadie confía)
Bailamos y se enamoró (¡Pu-pu-pu!)
""Nos vamos"", ella me dijo (Qué chimba SOG)

Mera chimba, se me pegó (Tra, tra)
No la dejo que baile sola (Yeah)
Con mi huella amaneció (Tra, tra)
Una mamacita en la zona

Zaga zaga zaga zau
En combination con SOG
Ryan Castro, baby
Es El Cantante del Ghe-Ghe-Ghe-Ghe-
Yeah, man (Bailamos y se enamoró)
(Un call a los bandido', no a la policía
Tengo un ángel que me guía y que me cuida)

LETRA BLESSD ✖️RYAN CASTRO | FUMANDO 🚬 

(Ryan Castro)
Y si la ven por ahí, yo la extraño a morir
Díganle que la quiero…

(Blessd)
Que prefiero morir a verla feliz
O hacerme el ciego…

Es tu recuerdo el que me parte el alma
La soledad, la única que me calma
Ya son las 6 de la mañana y la botella terminó

(Ryan Castro)
Si con otro te veo (ohh)
Prefiero hacerme el ciego (ohh)
Y si me ven llorando digo que no es por ti
Así en el fondo sepa que si es así
Me la paso fumando (ohh)
 
(Blessd)
Los recuerdos los quiero borrar 
Como el humo en los blones (ah no) 
Tú me desenamoraste con acciones
Yo solo quería dedicarte canciones
Paso con otras, solo sexo y condones
Y sufrí por mis emociones (sabe que mi amor)
Y sentí por tus ambiciones
Solo queda el recuerdo de tus besos (Sog, un chorro Sog)
Me la paso fumando (Y fume mijo)

Si con otro te veo (Sog)
Prefiero hacerme el ciego (De buena que sí)
Y si me ven llorando digo que no es por ti (ni por el p*tas)
Así en el fondo sepa que si es así
Me la paso fumando (que vuelta)

(Ryan Castro)
Yo me la paso fumando todo el día por ti
Combinábamos como los Louis Vuitton con Supreme
Te pido perdón si yo te hice sufrir 
Pero esta canción por ti yo la escribí 
Ay mami que rico como tú haces el amor
Bien bronceadita cuando se pone al sol
En la habitación sobró la ropa interior
Le dedique esta canción y la puso de ringtone

(Blessd)
Si la ven por ahí, yo la extraño a morir
Díganle que la quiero (Hey Sog decile que la quiero)
Que prefiero morir a verla feliz
O hacerme el ciego (Hasta la chim*)

(Ryan Castro)
Es tu recuerdo el que me parte el alma
La soledad, la única que me calma
Ya son las 6 de la mañana y la botella terminó (¿Sog pedimos otro o qué?)

(Blessd)
Si con otro te veo (ohh) 
Prefiero hacerme el ciego (ohh)
Y si me ven llorando digo que no es por ti 
Así en el fondo sepa que si es así
Me la paso fumando (ohh y fumando bareta)

Hey sabe que mi amor
Yo sé que usted está tranquila
Pero yo la estoy pensando todo el tiempo 
A cada momento
Y que vuelta que me haya pagado así
Porque de verdad la quería con el corazón
Pero no hay palabras pa’ usted mamacita 
¿Sabe qué? consígase lo que quiera 
Que chimbas es lo que existen en el mundo

LYRICS:
He don't love  
Me no more  
He don't love  
He don't love 
Me no more  

(First Verse) 
Evergreen, he controls me  
Was there something wrong with my body  
Am I not what you wanted, babe 
If I ever tried, if I ever tried  
I would  

(Chorus) 
Evergreen, he tears me to pieces  
Evergreen, doesn't even have to try  

(Verse Two) 
She don’t  
Know you like me  
She could never love you more  
More than me  
But sometimes I pray that you fall in love  
I've cried, I've cried so much  
For you baby 

(Chorus) 
Evergreen , he tears me to pieces  
Evergreen, doesn't even have to try  
Evergreen 

(Verse Three) 
You know you really made me hate myself  
Had to stop before I break myself  
Shoulda broke it off to date myself  
You didn't deserve me at all, at all, at all 

One last time 
I see, Evergreen 
Please don't come home to me  
Sweet Evergreen 
He don't love  
Me no more  

(Outro) 
He don’t love  
Me no more  
He don’t love  
He don't love  
Me no more

Lyrics:
Intro:
If I were to go 
Tell me would you 
Notice me 
If I were to go 
Tell me would you
Notice me 

First verse:
24hrs after CS:01 release 
I miss my girl it’s time to hit the streets
I went to check my doc get some vitamin C
You won’t believe what happened to me, I

Drip drip drip with the cold IV
Out of consciousness if I ever slip it

and I woke up in an ambulance 

If I were to go tell me would you notice me 
If I were to go tell me would you notice me 

Second verse:
64 hours since my baby spoke to me 
He kissed me now I love his dopamine 
I tried go to sleep but my brain on 2cb 
You won't believe what happened to me, I
Drip drip drip with the cold iv 
Out of consciousness if I ever slip it


I been gone moving, high speed now 
That's my song let me hear that bounce 
Latin boy Frida Khalo brow 
Jacquemus jeans Ferragamo brown
Venetian walls with porcelain tiles
286 Donnie Darko town 
If I’m down would you help me out 
If I’m down would you help me out

I had to call you back to tell you that (call me back)
You could have spared my feelings (could have spared my feelings)
I'm not invincible, I'm not invincible (oh)

I had to call you back to tell you that (call me back) 
You could have spared my feelings 
I'm not invincible (I'm not invincible) I'm not invincible 


If I were to go tell me would you notice me 
If I were to go tell me would you notice me

An exclusive live performance for Vevo. 

The designer tote bag that is Omar Apollo's 'Ivory' wisely holds ingredients from various aisles of the pop grocery store, including UK house, Latin trap, sadboi guitar ballads, and adult R&B. In lesser hands, this mix could yield a tasteless melange. But Apollo is far more than just a handsome face with an impressive vocal range. Critics have honed in on his deft lyricism and inventive producer skills; 2020’s ‘Apolonio’ EP drew comps to ‘Channel Orange’-era Frank Ocean. And voice-wise, Apollo's sensual confidence has been equated to that of Miguel - big compliment. ‘Ivory’ is a well-balanced 16-course meal, and though it contains dollops of sentimentality, is neither too sweet nor too rich. Check “Invincible,"" a Daniel Caesar collab that ebbs and flows between a timid electric guitar, fluttering bass line, and catalyzing breakbeat - ambitious but not ostentatious. The singer's falsetto cuts through our studio walls in this exclusive performance, and its mate “Killing Me” cuts to the chase in a whole different way, wink wink. You’ll definitely want more of what he cooked up for us.

Lyrics:

Yourself to me baby (baby)
Already got what I'll ever need (ever need)
I know deep in me there's everything (everything)
What if I trust myself endlessly? (endlessly)

If you me need now I would hold you tight, Hold you tight 
Hold you tight
If you change your mind, don’t wait til the moments right

You ain’t even touched me in so long, You ain’t said you loved me in so long 
You don’t even try to call my phone, Did you even love me all along?
You ain’t even touched me in so long, You ain’t said you loved me in so long 
You don’t even try to call my phone, Did you even love me all along?

Yourself to me baby (baby)
Already got what I'll ever need (ever need)
I know deep in me there's everything (everything)
What if I trust myself endlessly? (endlessly)

Cause if I decide to leave tonight, I’ll have no pride 
At least I could try to be by your side 
But somethings not right (somethings not right)
You ain’t even touched me in so long, You ain’t said you loved me in so long 
You don’t even try to call my phone, Did you even love me all along?
You ain’t even touched me in so long, You ain’t said you loved me in so long 
You don’t even try to call my phone, Did you even love me all along?

Lyrics:

There’s a lot of boys in California
They don’t get along like you and I
So pretty that you kill me softly
If you were to leave, if I were to die

You know I really want to risk it all
Kiss my collarbone, found my archetype

If you need me, I’ll be right there waitin’
Hold me ‘till I break thin, don’t want this to end 
(don’t want this to end)
Could you help me, help you think about me
I think of you daily, I could give you all 
(I could give you all)

You’re the only one that holds me
You’re the only one that holds me
Yea, I know you’re feeling paranoia
Are you in love, cause I wanna try

I can tell just by the way that you’re talking (to me)
You don’t have a clue (don’t have a clue)
Neither do I
I didn’t really think you cared at all
What you said on the phone
Left me petrified

If you need me, I’ll be right there waitin’
Hold me ‘till I break thin, don’t want this to end 
(don’t want this to end)
Could you help me, help you think about me
I think of you daily, I could give you all 
(I could give you all)

You’re the only one that holds me
You’re the only one that holds me
You’re the only one that holds me
You’re the only one that holds me

Lyrics:

You can take the throne
Body glows like gold
Beating hearts locked close
Without you time moves slow

Do you think that I could stay
Cause if I leave then I’ll complain
I know this feeling’s not a crime
You said you feel it all the time

But if you have to go away again
I just don’t see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
There’s something in the way I feel your skin
I just don’t see you enough
I wish I saw you enough

If you saw me every mornin’ would you feel less important
Is that too much of forcing
Cause I don’t wanna be much
I love the way that we touch

Do you like all my friends, yeah?
I want your attention
Before you ever mentioned that you got time here to stay
Is that too much for your brain

But if you have to go away again
I just don’t see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
There’s something in the way I feel your skin
I just don’t see you enough
I wish I saw you enough

But if you have to go away again
I just don’t see you enough
I wish I saw you enough

But if you have to go away again
I just don’t see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
There’s something in the way I feel your skin
I just don’t see you enough
I wish I saw you enough

18, we were undergrads
Stayed out late, never made it to class, uh
Outer Richmond in a taxi cab
You were sweating bullets on the way to my dad’s
And oh,
You said, “Baby, think we’re moving too fast!”
 
And I swear the magnolias flashed a smile (flashed a smile)
And that’s when I caught me hoping you’d stay a while (stay a whiiiile)
 
Baby, I’d give up anything to travel inside your mind
Baby, I fall in love again come every summertime
My daddy taught me to choose ‘em wisely but you don’t have to try
Coz baby I fall in love every summertime
 
25, man we’re missing church
Laugh ‘bout everyone we’re hating at work
Dinner with your sister and the jokes kinda hurt 
Cry the way home and you’re putting me first, oh
Yeah, you just always know what to say
 
We’re strolling down the boulevard, and dancing under streetlights (oh the lights)
Every year we get older and I’m still on your side (oh IIIII)
 
Baby, I’d give up anything to travel inside your mind
Baby, I fall in love again come every summertime
My daddy taught me to choose ‘em wisely but you don’t have to try
Coz baby I fall in love every summertime
 
Every day is summertime
Every day is summertime
Every day is summertime 
with you

VERSE 1
Didn’t you hear Amanda’s moving back to Colorado?
It’s 2013 & the end of my life
Freshman year’s about to plummet just a little harder 
But it didn’t cause we kissed on that Halloween night 

VERSE 2
I bleached half my hair when I saw Zoe on your Vespa
It was orange from 3% peroxide, thanks to you
I needed a good cry, I headed right to Kendra’s
I hated you and I hoped to God that you knew

PRE CHORUS 1
Now there’s drama (drama)
Found a club for that
Where I met ya (met ya)
Had a heart attack
Yadda yadda 
At the end, yeah we burned, made a couple U-turns, you were it til you weren’t

CHORUS 1
High school in Jakarta, sorta modern Sparta
Had no chance against the teenage suburban armadas
We were a sonata, thanks to tight-lipped fathers
Yeah living under that was hard, but I loved you harder
High school in Jakarta, an elaborate saga
I still hate you for making me wish I came out smarter
You love/hate your mother, so do I 
Could’ve ended different, then again we went to high school in Jakarta

VERSE 2
Got a group assignment, I’ll be at Vall’s place
You don’t text at all and only call when you’re off your face 
I’m petty and say, “Call me when you’re not unstable”
I lie and tell you I’ll be getting drunk at Rachel’s

PRE CHORUS 2
I wasn’t
She doesn’t even drink
But I couldn’t have you sit there and think
That you’re better, cause you’re older 
Are you better, now that we’re older?

CHORUS 2
High school in Jakarta, sorta modern Sparta
Had no chance against the teenage suburban armadas
We were a sonata, thanks to tight-lipped fathers
Yeah living under that was hard, but I loved you harder
High school in Jakarta, a comedy drama
I still hate you for making me wish I came out smarter
You love/hate your mother, so do I 
Could’ve ended different, then again we went to high school in Jakarta

BRIDGE
Natasha’s moving to New York
Probably sometime in August
And I’m spending the summer in Singapore
I’m so sad I can’t tell you shit anymore 
I made friends with Abby this year
We’re moving in in March or so
And although you bring me to tears
I’m glad that we gave it a go

CHORUS 3
High school in Jakarta, American summer
Had no chance against the Marxist girl with marijuana 
I was your piñata, she was a star-charter
Glad she gave it to you real hard, but I loved you harder
High school in Jakarta,
I won’t but I wanna
Ask you when you talk about it do I ever come up?
Say thanks to your mama, now we’re through
Could’ve ended different, then again we went to high school in Jakarta

LYRICS:

[VERSE 1]
While I'm on Sunset, are you on the subway?
While I drive, are you gettin' on the L-train?
I mean, Manhattan's nice, but so are Malibu nights
You would know if you stayed, 
You would know if you put up a fight

Your toes turn blue in winter, I'm gettin' red
Rum does the trick for all of the things left unsaid
I'm missin' our drunken 2 A.M. strolls in K-Town
Now you're chasing fake highs in the Upper West Side

[PRE-CHORUS 1]
And fuckin' on Brooklyns in Brooklyn, 
Your Chelseas in Chelsea
Hope that eases the pain, so you remember to miss me
And you sold your car, now you walk for miles
Bet your feet feel numb
(Crosswalks in my mind are shaky, so please hold on tight)

[CHORUS]
All my demons run wild
All my demons have your smile
in the city of angels, in the city of angels
Hope New York holds you
Hope it holds you like I do
While my demons stay faithful, 
in the city of angels

[VERSE 2]
Summer's endin' now and the nights are coolin' down
Remember last winter when we would drive around
Silverlake, Hollywood, pretty little white lies got me good
Thought this was love, I was misunderstood, mm

[PRE-CHORUS 2]
Feelin' low on the low, drivin' through NoHo
If I'm honest, I'd call, but I'm trying to let go
And I hope you're happy, livin' life in taxis
But you'll always have me, you'll always have me

[CHORUS]
All my demons run wild
All my demons have your smile
in the city of angels, in the city of angels
Hope New York holds you
Hope it holds you like I do
While my demons stay faithful 
in the city of angels

LYRICS:
Saturday sunset, we’re lying on my bed with five hours to go
Fingers entwined and so were our minds cryin, 'I don’t want you to go'
You wiped away tears but not fears under the still and clear indigo
You said, ‘Baby don’t cry, we’ll be fine, you’re the one thing I swear I can’t outgrow’
My mother said the younger me was a 'Pretending' prodigy,
well nothing, then, much has changed
Coz while you’re wolfing down liquor, my soul it gets sicker,
but I’m stickin' to the screenplay, gotta say I’m okay,
but answer this babe:
How is it now that somehow you’re a stranger? You were mine just yesterday
I prayed the block in my airway dissipates and instead deters your airplane’s way
But heaven denied
Destiny decried
Something beautiful died
too soon
But I’m letting go
I’m givin’ up the ghost
But don’t get me wrong,
I’ll always love you, that’s why
I wrote you this very last song
I guess this is where we say goodbye
I know I’ll be alright
Someday I’ll be fine
but just not tonight
Plunging into all kinds of diversions like blush wine and sonorous soirées
But even with gin and surgin’ adrenaline, I see you’re all that can intoxicate
Oceans and engines, you’re skilled at infringin' on great love affairs
'cause now my heart’s home, all I’ve known, is long gone and 10 thousand miles away
Plunging into all kinds of diversions like blush wine and sonorous soirées
But even with gin and surgin’ adrenaline, I see you’re all that can intoxicate
Oceans and engines, you’re skilled at infringin' on great love affairs
'cause now my heart’s home, all I’ve known, is long gone and 10 thousand miles away
And I’m not okay
But I’m letting go
I’m givin’ up the ghost
But don’t get me wrong
I’ll always love you and that’s why
I wrote you this very last song
I guess this is where we say goodbye
I know I’ll be alright
But just not-
Tonight was the first time I stared into seas of beguiling sepia two years ago
And the first time I learned real world superpowers lived in three words and could revitalize my fraying bones
What do you do when your pillar crumbled down, you’ve lost all solid ground, both dreams and demons drowned, and this void’s all you’ve found and doubts light it aglow?
I have so many questions
But I’m pouring them into the ocean and I’m starting up my engine
and I’m letting go
I’m givin’ up your ghost
It’s come to a close
I marked the end with this last song I wrote
I’m letting go
This is the last falsetto
I’ll ever sing to you my great, lost love

""Lose"" Lyrics
VERSE 1
I will never know if you love me 
or my company, but I don’t mind
‘Cause I ain’t tryna be the one,
Been through this a thousand times
I don’t needa take your heart, 
you keep yours I’ll keep mine

VERSE 2
All I really know is when I’m lonely.
I hate that I’m lonely,
and that’s why I let you in
and Maybe in another life we fight all day, kiss all night
But I don’t wanna break your heart, you keep yours I’ll keep mine

PRECHORUS 1
I know 
we know better so, 
we’d both better go

HOOK
I don’t need a reason
To keep on dreamin’
that we don’t lose, yeah what’s the use?
I don’t need a reason
To keep on dreamin’, oh
That we can win at anything at all

VERSE 3
Am I the only one who sees right through this? 
Yeah all this bullshit,
Don’t play me for no fool
Yeah you don’t gotta lose your mind, every time I don’t call
and I should never have to win your love,
then hate myself when I don’t, oh, oh

VERSE 4
Fickle as you are, that’s exactly why I keep on running back 
‘Cause I’m brittle at the parts where I wish I were strong
And maybe when you need my help, I like myself when it’s over
but later in the light, you go dark and rogue, and I need closure

PRECHORUS 2
and I know, whatever this is ain’t love
So I’m goin’,
I’m gonna let you go, let you go

HOOK
I don’t need a reason
To keep on dreamin’
that we dont lose, yeah what’s the use?
I don’t need a reason
To keep on dreamin’
That I can win this stupid thing called love

[VERSE 1]
I can’t lie, it feels nice that you’re calling
You sound sad and alone and you’re stalling
and for once, I don’t care about what you want, as long as we keep talking
(as long as we’re talking)
 
[VERSE 2]
I mean, you gotta admit the history’s
kind of unmatched
Asian Calvinism— we made it out of that
Well, whether we’re free of will or predestined,
Clearly I’ve not learned my lesson even now
Hope He doesn’t strike me down (strike me down)
 
[PRE CHORUS 1]
The Goo Goo Dolls are dead to me
the way you should be too
but you bring them up
along with how much I fucking miss you
 
[CHORUS 1]
Maybe I’m just not better than this, I haven’t tried
Maybe life’s less romantic when I don’t wanna die 
You’d think I’d be a fast learner
but guess I won’t ever mind crisping up on your backburner
 
[POST]
Your backburner
Your backburner
Your backburner
 
[VERSE 2]
It’s pathetic but at least, you are too 
I don’t know what to do
I don’t like anyone except sometimes you
And now you’re sounding like a hurt puppy
You look ugly when you cry
but I’m the one you think to call
How do you feel lucky and appalled 
at the same time?
After everything you put me through 
I somehow still believe in you, oh (I do, I do, I do)
 
[PRE CHORUS 2]
but I know in a week or so,
you’ll fade away again
and I wish that I cared 
Hey are you still there?
Good 
 
[CHORUS 2]
Maybe I’m just not better than this, I haven’t tried
Cause maybe you’ll finally choose me after you’ve had more time
I thought I was a fast learner,
but guess I won’t ever mind, guess I won’t ever mind
Maybe I blame my mother bleeding into my stride
Maybe it was my father and his wandering eyes
(It’s their fault that) I’ll always be in your corner
Cause I don’t feel alive ‘til I’m burning on your backburner
 
[POST]
Oh, and I know that it’s sad that I settle for the backburner
Oh, guess I won’t ever mind crisping up on your backburner
Oh, as long as you still think of me
Oh

LETRA:
Y no tengo pensado
Hundirme acá tirado
Y no tengo planeado
Morirme desangrado

Y no…
No me pidas que no vuelva a intentar
Que las cosas vuelvan a su lugar

Y no tengo pensado
Hundirme acá tirado
Y no tengo planeado
Morirme desangrado

Y no…
No me pidas que no vuelva a intentar
Que las cosas vuelvan a su lugar 

Estamos siendo cuidadosos
Como caminando por un piso resbaloso
Sabiendo que un paso en falso nos lleva al fondo del pozo
Será lo tembloroso de la espuma bailando en mi corazón rabioso

Entender todo es un poco soberbio
Querer explicar todo es un poco por nervios
Por eso hablo hasta por los codos si me pongo ebrio
Y ya no sé si jodo o me lo tomo en serio

Y desconfío, el miedo a dar un salto y encontrar vacío
Ansío que esto que siento no sea mío
¿Por qué de pronto se siente tan frío?
Parece que saber hacerse bien es todo un desafío

Qué rabia me da el amor… voy a arrancármelo
Qué rabia me da el amor, voy a quedármelo 
Prefiero lo tortuoso del ritual
Que lo decoroso de estar siempre igual

¿Habrá motivo para estar mal?
O debo ser yo presintiendo el final, no es eterno el carnaval
Si es etéreo lo carnal
Encontraremos algún otro canal para juntar el plexo

De fondo un saxo y queremos sexo
Ahora recuerdo la primera vez que te reíste
Y las ganas que me dieron de que se me ocurra un chiste
¿Cómo van a convencerme de que la magia no existe?

Y no tengo pensado
Hundirme acá tirado
Y no tengo planeado
Morirme desangrado 

Y no…
No me pidas que no vuelva a intentar
Que las cosas vuelvan a su lugar 

Y no tengo pensado
Hundirme acá tirado
Y no tengo planeado
Morirme desangrado 

Y no…
No me pidas que no vuelva a intentar

LETRA:
Estoy sentado esperando que se pase el rato
Estas palabras se parecen a mi autorretrato
Ey, hoy ya no quiero hablar
Si las sensaciones que en serio cambiaron mi vida
No creo que las pueda explicar

Voy a amarte, y tocarte
Solo te pido que no me apuñales 
Cuando abra mi cuerpo pa darte un lugar
Y el mar se va, con mis secretos
Los va a llevar marea adentro

Siempre vuelvo con mi sombra
Te invito a que la conozcas
Me revuelco con mi sombra
Te pido que no la rompas

Tengo estudio y un colchón
Tengo amigos un montón
Tengo vino y un melón
Ready para el vacilón, ey

Tengo, gano
Busco, voy, rompo todo lo que soy

Tengo estudio y un colchón
Tengo amigos un montón
Tengo vino y un melón
Ready para el vacilón, ey

Tengo, gano
Busco, voy, rompo todo lo que soy

Estoy sentado esperando que se pase el rato
Estas palabras se parecen a mi autorretrato
Ey, hoy ya no quiero hablar
Si las sensaciones que en serio cambiaron mi vida
No creo que las pueda explicar

Voy a convidarte
Una parte de mí
Para ir por ahí
Vamo en mi Zeppelin

Si el mundo está roto que traigan otro
O mejor nos vamos todos nosotros
No quiero vivir con sabor a poco
No quiero morir sin volverme loco

Cuando miremos y no entendamos
Nada de todo lo que ahora vemos
Voy a quedarme con vos al lado
Cuando todo se nos ponga feo

Y cuando esta vida rara y descarada
Se lleve puesto a algún amigo
Cuando lo más común pierda sentido,
Siempre vas a poder venir conmigo

Nuestra mirada es la fuerza más linda de todas
Quiero esconderme en tu pecho y que nada me joda
Dale vámonos, y perdámonos
Tirame una magia y llevame en tu escoba

Tengo estudio y un colchón
Tengo amigos un montón
Tengo vino y un melón
Ready para el vacilón, ey

Tengo, gano
Busco, voy, rompo todo lo que soy

Tengo estudio y un colchón
Tengo amigos un montón
Tengo vino y un melón
Ready para el vacilón, ey

Tengo, gano
Busco, voy, rompo todo lo que soy

Tengo estudio y un colchón
Tengo amigos un montón
Tengo vino y un melón
Ready para el vacilón, ey

Tengo, gano
Busco, voy, rompo todo lo que soy

LETRA

Se siente raro lo que toca
se convierte en ascensor 
se morfa el ramo de la esposa
 pero espera lo peor

Ya vendieron todo pero bueno
No lo ascienden porque no lo vieron
Y ya le descontaron la mitad de enero
Se rompe todo, se prende fuego
pero se queda y a lo mejor 

Lo que era raro con el tiempo
Se camufle con su voz 
Por sus horarios en el centro
Lo confunden con el sol

Pero se mezcla en tus ojos
Buscando otra versión  
Ya no la ve ni cuadrada 
Y se le ocurre decirte algo mejor

Quereme
te creo pero quereme
hasta que llegue quereme 
aunque nos cueste quereme 

Todo es una lotería 
Y yo deseando ganar algo de lo que pedías 
Se esta tornando raro seguir en caída 
Y verme tramando el salto cortando el paracaídas

Y ahora parece que nunca amanece
Que el cielo esta gris y los colores fallecen
Por más que me pese no se cuántas veces
Todo lo que traje fácil se desaparece

Crezco y me desvanezco voy
Viendo el tiempo que merezco hoy
Solo buscaba algo de simpatía 
Y me devolves esa mirada fría

Seres imaginarios están copando el barrio
puede que perdamos pero somos varios 
Con historias grandes para el anecdotario
Queda el orgullo y el amor

Y si la vida es una arena movediza 
No se va a salvar ninguno de los que la pisa
Eso es así, decís que no
Llega el fin y no se quien sos

si la vida es una arena movediza 
No se va a salvar ninguno de los que la pisa
Eso es así, decís que no
Llega el fin y no se quien sos

Quereme 
Te creo pero quereme
Hasta que llegue quereme
Aunque nos cueste quereme

Pero se mezcla en tus ojos
Buscando otra versión  
Ya no la ve ni cuadrada 
Y se le ocurre decirte algo mejor

LETRA:

Fluyo, pensando sin tapujos
Muevo las manos como si fuese un brujo
Me colgué y ya no sé a dónde me dirijo
Somos inmortales cuando no' miramo' fijo
Te vi y perdí el calibre
Abrí la jaula y me olvidé de cómo ser libre (pa'lante)
Con vos es todo más simple
Te vi un rato y se me fue lo triste
Había lugar en tu cama y me volví un okupa
El sol en la ventana que hiciste de lupa
No sé de quién es la culpa
No sé de quién es la culpa
Había lugar en tu cama y me volví un okupa
El sol en la ventana que hiciste de lupa
No sé de quién es la culpa
No sé de quién es la culpa
De quién es la culpa
No sé de quién es la culpa, no sé
De quién es la—
De quién es la—no hay culpa
Es como una lanza, clavada en la panza
Las palabras que tengo guardada' ya no alcanzan (No)
No quiero pararme a equilibrar esta balanza
Hagamos que vaya y venga como si fuese una danza
Y qué ansias, de volver, de volver a hacerte estremecer
De cambiar la suerte y no tener
Que parar un rato a pensar en la muerte, yo qué sé
Y hoy voy a por más, y vos me hablás
Decís que no querés perturbar mi paz
No te das cuenta las noches que me aliviás
Con las cosas esas locas que vos me contás
Y no me pidas que no venga a decirte
""Gracias por los días en los que no te fuiste""
Que me gusta mucho que no funcione tu timbre
Que me dejas que delire, que saque mi alma de tigre
Había lugar en tu cama y me volví un okupa
El sol en la ventana que hiciste de lupa
No sé de quién es la culpa
No sé de quién es la culpa
Había lugar en tu cama y me volví un okupa
El sol en la ventana que hiciste de lupa
No sé de quién es la culpa
No sé de quién es la culpa
De quién es la culpa
No sé de quién es la culpa, no sé
De quién es la—
De quién es la—no hay culpa

Letra:

¿Que no soy el mismo? Obvio que cambio,
si suena otra música es distinto lo que bailo
yo sí tengo los huevos para hacerme cargo,
me adapto, vuelo, rapto, no le escapo al contacto.

Todo tan duro y la vida es frágil,
sé que soy de vidrio y que puedo romperme fácil,
no tengo delirios pero casi,
no tengo delirios pero...

Sé que hay golpes que aguanto y otros no tanto,
y si me caigo no me levanto
hoy quiero dormir acurrucado como un gato,
aparecé en mis sueños por lo menos así charlamos un rato.

Y no me cuesta admitir que aunque me dedico a las palabras
hoy no tengo qué decir
¿de qué me sirve mentir?
prefiero sentir la angustia y el vacío de existir.

Quiero morir pero no sé cómo,
quiero vivir pero no sé cuánto,
morir sabiendo la mierda que somos
y vivir hasta que se acabe el encanto.

Perdón mi amor si esto te dolió,
quise morir de amor pero no me salió,
quizá solo pienso en mí y en mi bienestar
y sea solo eso lo que me impide amar.

No puedo amar, ¿no puedo amar?
o solo no amo como aman los demás,
¿cómo hay que amar? ¿hay que amar?
hay que desarmar los preceptos hechos y tirarse al mar.

¿Plata? Obvio que quiero,
pero la vida es un flash como para pensar solo en dinero,
si estoy solo, ¿pa' qué quiero estar primero?
me deprime imaginarme dormir solo con mi ego.

¿Cómo querés que no tenga sabor a poco?
si esa chica me dio un beso y después me pidió una foto,
ya no sé qué tan real es lo que toco,
se me acercan y yo me construí una cerca para no volverme loco.

Me pregunta ¿todo okey? Saben que está todo mal
les respondo todo bien, porque sé que les da igual,
no pido que intentes ponerte en mi lugar,
con el tuyo es suficiente, eso es mucho pa' afrontar.

Entonces no te dediques a hablar,
la cosa está jodida como pa' que vengas a criticar,
me viste cara de bueno y te querés zarpar,
esta vez te rompo el cuello y te lo digo literal.

Hace tiempo que vengo batiendo mi posta
así que ningún gil va a robarme la torta,
la hago corta, la rebano con mis manos si el cuchillo no corta,
tu supuesta verdad me sabe a bosta.

Todo muere, todo vuelve, todo se transforma,
pero tenés miedo de romper las normas,
de aguantar las bombas, eso te trastorna
hay que ser valiente para pelear con tu sombra.",False,False,81806561.0,Not Found

Hoy nos vamos a escapar, pa' 'delante y sin mirar
Cuántas vueltas vamo' a dar hasta encontrarnos de nuevo
Hoy nos vamos a escapar, pa' 'delante y sin mirar
Cuántas vueltas vamo' a dar hasta encontrarnos de nuevo
Salgo con lo puesto, te ofrezco, o esto que es fresco
Sin mirar al resto, no es que no sea modesto
Pero ahora ya no me preocupa
Los gestos de los gile' que andan mirando con lupa, wow
Nosotros en la nuestra, goce y plenitud
Y vos fichando el estilo que trae mi crew
Vos no estás en mi club, te falta acá actitud
Estás mirando para ver cómo robarme el groove
Traje ron con limón pa' cortar con estos día' grises
Si esta ciudad parece un congreso de infelices
El cemento caliente ya formó un desierto
El mundo es un manicomio pero a cielo abierto
Sale el sol, se baila malambo
Pintó calorcito, por eso traje unos mangos
Y eso de ahogar las penas lo hacemo' escabiando
Nunca nos sale bien, por eso terminan flotando
Miedo, tienen los que no caminan
Juego, a caerme para arriba
Fuego, para quemar tu mentira
Y no me preguntes lo que hice porque ya no sé
No quiero caer, hoy salgo a matar
No pienso volver, a quedarme atrá'
No me digas na', que voy para allá
Que voy para arriba y no pienso mirar
Hoy nos vamos a escapar, pa' 'delante y sin mirar
Cuántas vueltas vamo' a dar hasta encontrarnos de nuevo
Hoy nos vamos a escapar, pa' 'delante y sin mirar
Cuántas vueltas vamo' a dar hasta encontrarnos de nuevo
No sé cómo hacer para decirte que te vi
Y que sentí, para decirte que
Que ahora nada malo va a poder pasarte
Que encuentro algo lindo en esto de extrañarte
Siento que estás ahí, aunque no pueda hablarte
Tu calor me acompaña siempre va pa' todas parte'
Miedo, tienen los que no caminan
Juego, a caerme para arriba
Fuego, para quemar tu mentira
Y no me preguntes lo que hice porque ya no sé
No quiero caer, hoy salgo a matar
No pienso volver, a quedarme atrás
No me digas na', que voy para allá
Que voy para arriba y no pienso mirar
Pa' abajo, no estamo' picando el ajo
Muevo la cadera y se va to' al carajo, wow
El silbido del viento susurra que ya no podemos mirar
Pa' abajo, nena, nos costó trabajo
Moveme las caderas y se va to' al carajo, wow
El silbido del viento susurra al oído que ya no podemos mirar

cállenlo, sédenlo, que haga lo que quiera pero sáquenlo

háganme caso, ¿o no tienen claro que soy el rey?
háganme caso que soy la ley, dame mis blíster mis parisiennes

patada de canguro, golpe duro 
no vamos a parar con esto negro te lo juro
traje cianuro, pa' meterles en el trago
5 minutos acá y ya estamos causando estragos

un mago nos quiere hacer desaparecer
pero esta plaga rara nunca para de crecer
somos de los pocos locos que andan buscando placer
y aunque quieran vernos rotos no damos brazo a torcer

no para de toser trabajando 12 horas
cobra dos monedas al mes pa' mantener 4 personas
y no hables de meritocracia, me da gracia, no me jodas
que sin oportunidades esa mierda no funciona

y no, no hace falta gente que labure más
hace falta que con menos se pueda vivir en paz
mandale gas, no te perdás, acordate dónde estás
fijate siempre de qué lado de la mecha te encontrás

esto pega como coca
la gente baila loca 
el cuello se disloca

la droga en los dedos que vaya de boca en boca
sentís como te choca, 
esa vaina subió la nota

salto como una pulga, empezó la purga
largo todo fresco como pxxr gvng
otra vez con sed entre fiebres y migrañas
vuelvo a soñar con un viejo en el medio de una montaña

me miró y me dijo de la vida nadie se salva
y eso de la juventud es solo una actitud del alma
qué virtud extraña, ahora me queman las entrañas
mi mejor conversación la tuve ayer con una araña

no sé qué hora es ni me interesa, acá
siempre son 4:20 y estamos de la cabeza, con simpleza 
birra barata y mala en lata más la planta santa esa 
la que calma el cuerpo y te lo desestresa

el hood está de fiesta, el culo se te tensa
entiendo que te molesta, la empatía te cuesta
y si ahora gritamos y cantamos en modo de protesta
es porque preguntamos bien y nadie nos dio una respuesta

se creen dueños, salgan del medio, lo digo en serio
fuera la yuta que meten al barrio, le tira a los pibes y le mata 
los sueños

bueno, juego, del underground, del agujero, estamos agitando 
de nuevo, sacando pa' fuera a esos carroñeros, ñero.

Letra:

Quisiera sacar mi lado oscuro, rapearte con mi parte de tipo duro, 
Pero no puedo, hoy me curo, mato al parásito en mi cuero cabelludo
Termino y te ayudo, es que todavía dudo y si la ansiedad me toma le hago una toma de judo, 
lo que viene mal me lo tomo con jugo, o me meto en la bañera hasta que me arrugo 

Hoy será mejor que no baje, 
Con su carácter hizo que me relaje 
Hoy será mejor que no baje
Voy de cabeza pa' que nadie me ataje

Hoy solo por primera vez diré que me quemé 
Por dentro cuando en serio me miré
Me sinceré, viré, y ya no sé qué quiero hacer
Al menos sé lo que no quiero 

Ya no sé muy bien lo que me pasa
Encontré la llave y me olvidé dónde es mi casa 
Creo que hace tiempo vivo en una carcasa 
Vamos a quemar a la terraza

Ya no sé muy bien nada, lo que me pasa 
Encontré la llave y me olvidé dónde es mi casa
Creo que hace tiempo vivo en una carcasa 
Dame un abrazo y se me pasa

Si no nos vemos por un tiempo 
Recibo tus mensajes a través del viento
Quiero hacerle un masaje a mis pensamientos
Para que se ablanden no hablen en cualquier momento
Tengo claro que eso es un entrenamiento 
Si esta cultura te hace adicto al sufrimiento
Adicta a una fila de lamentos,
saco el cuchillo pa' cortarlo en filamentos

Hoy será mejor que no baje
Con su carácter hizo que me relaje 
Hoy será mejor que no baje 
Voy de cabeza pa' que nadie me ataje 

Y en cada borra del café veré que no perderé la fe, volveré y aunque sé que arderé en llamas, resucitaré, una cita haré 
Y te citaré versos en medio de tu cama

Ya no sé muy bien lo que me pasa,
Encontré la llave y me olvidé dónde es mi casa
Creo que hace tiempo vivo en una carcasa 
Vamos a quemar a la terraza

Ya no sé muy bien nada, lo que me pasa 
Encontré la llave y me olvidé dónde es mi casa 
Creo que hace tiempo vivo en una carcasa
Dame un abrazo y se me pasa

Hoy bajo, superviso
Te escucho de verdad, yo no te analizo 
Me cago en Freud, hoy me guían los astros 
Y creo que hace rato no aterrizo 
Tantas cosas de mierda que las canalizo 
Bailando con los wachos casi que pegado al piso, borracho y esquizo
cómo es que lo hizo, es que así soy
Lo drogado no me saca lo preciso 

Y llegan los míos haciendo fondo con el cáliz
Flacos y doblados parecemos origami
Los lugares a donde voy preguntan quién es que soy, soy el mono más rabioso de todo el safari

Eh, dale, vámonos que tengo sed 
Y ya no tengo nada para hacer

En alguna vuelta te veré
Ya no tengo miedo de perder.",False,False,72636523.0,Not Found

LETRA:

Toda la noche está contando ovejas
hasta que se pierden en la luz del día
juega con la nostalgia de ver que se alejan
y no saber si vuelven en su compañía 

Yo ya la conocía, la loca baila sola en esa esquina
y cuando me ve me silba melodías
dice que si lo malo pega fuerte y deja heridas
el corazón transforma la canción en su mejor guarida

Y aunque no quiera oscurecerme
cuenta que no es buena en eso de la suerte
que el brebaje bajo el brazo la acompaña siempre
y es pa’ acortar el plazo de su cita con la muerte 

Camina el planeta
siente que algo le falta, que no nació completa 
que nunca nadie supo cómo quererla de cerca
quizás no tenga cara y sea solo una silueta 

Mirala cómo baila (eh)

Nadie quiere mirar
cuando ella gambetea entre la tempestad
un trago por el miedo a la soledad
un trago por el miedo a la sobriedad

(Mirala cómo baila) (eh)

Nadie quiere mirar
cuando ella gambetea entre la tempestad
cuando la noche aprieta sale a susurrar 
permanecer tan cuerdo te puede hacer mal

¿Qué voy a hacer? ¿Qué voy a hacer?
quemando el tiempo con mi mechero
¿Qué voy a hacer? ¿Qué voy a hacer?
mastico el aire mientras la espero 

Solo siento el frío del vacío en mi cama
ella no está ahí
ahora me toca esperarla a mí
contando ovejas, contando ovejas

La loca ya no está donde solía estar
sentada en ese banco le gustaba inventar  
historias que me daba para terminar
quiero encontrarla pa’ decirle que les escribí un final

Pero dicen que su ser está huyendo
que perdió la fe y se está hundiendo 
yo quiero creer que solo se fue
a saciar su sed y que ya estará volviendo
pronto nos estaremos viendo

Buscaba juventud en cada viaje
y se perdió en el loop de la luz de esa calle ya sé, en algo siempre hay que creer 
cuando la vida te está ardiendo 

Mirala cómo baila (eh)

Nadie quiere mirar 
cuando ella gambetea entre la tempestad
un trago por el miedo a la soledad
un trago por el miedo a la sobriedad

(Mirala cómo baila) (eh)

Nadie quiere mirar
cuando ella gambetea entre la tempestad
cuando la noche aprieta sale a susurrar 
permanecer tan cuerdo te puede hacer mal

¿Qué voy a hacer? ¿Qué voy a hacer?
quemando el tiempo con mi mechero
¿Qué voy a hacer? ¿Qué voy a hacer?
mastico el aire mientras la espero 

Solo siento el frío del vacío en mi cama
ella no está ahí
ahora me toca esperarla a mí
contando ovejas, contando ovejas

¿Qué voy a hacer? ¿Qué voy a hacer?
quemando el tiempo con mi mechero
¿Qué voy a hacer? ¿Qué voy a hacer?
mastico el aire mientras la espero 

Buscaba juventud en cada viaje
y se perdió en el loop de la luz de esa calle ya sé, 
en algo siempre hay que creer 
cuando la vida te está ardiendo.",True,True,18804921.0,Not Found

Lyrics:

Verse 1: 

Oh no 
Look who guessed your password right 
Oh no 
And the girl you said ain’t your type

Is sending 
messages  
Messages 
They never end 

That’s a whole of messages 
For just a friend 

Oh no 
Had a feeling I knew what I’d find 

Chorus:

You met up with Veronica late last night 
You had a bit of Eleanor on the side 
Was chatting up Anita all last week 
And now you’re doing Nina 
How’d you even meet her? 

Hitting on Bianca are you dumb?
Got with Alexandra and her Mum 
You’re telling every girl they drive you mad 
Yet you’re calling me the psychopath 

Post:

I’m the psychopath x 5

Verse 2:

Oh no you got to be kidding 
You say how much you respect women 
I’m buying your meals 
I’m paying your bills 
While you’re out here switching positions 

Aitch verse:
Hold up wait babe I ain’t finished 
(Hold up wait yeah)
All in my face girl you tripping
(Why you tripping for) 
It’s not what it looks like they’re bruises not love bites
Anne-Marie:
Good luck with that hole that you’re digging
Aitch:
I don’t fuck with Emily on my life 
Had to cut off Beverly at least I tried 
All these other girls that I can’t see 
I just want a …. Anne-Marie 
Hahaha

Oh no 
call me crazy all you like 

Oh no 
Turns out I was fucking right

Chorus:

You met up with Veronica late last night 
You had a bit of Eleanor on the side 
Was chatting up Anita all last week 
And now you’re doing Nina 
How’d you even meet her? 

Hitting on Bianca are you dumb?
Got with Alexandra and her Mum 
You’re telling every girl they drive you mad 
Yet you’re calling me the psychopath

About Anne-Marie:
Anne-Marie has proved to be one of the UK’s most exciting and successful British breakthrough popstars of recent years. A former 3x world karate champion and West End child star-turned 9x BRIT Award nominee, A-M’s rise has been nothing short of meteoric. In 2018 Anne-Marie released her debut album, ‘Speak Your Mind’ which featured the hit singles 'Alarm', 'Ciao Adios', 'Heavy', 'Friends', '2002' and 'Perfect to Me'. She subsequently ended that year as as the UK’s biggest-selling debut artist, selling out headline shows and playing stadium dates supporting long-time friend and champion Ed Sheeran in the process.

She has also sang on and co-written many other hits such as Birthday, Rockabye, Don't Leave Me Alone,  To Be Young, f*ck, i'm lonely and Don't Play, collaborating with the likes of Clean Bandit, Marshmello, David Guetta, Lauv, Rudimental, Doja Cat and KSI, as well as starring on The Greatest Showman: Reimagined soundtrack performing Rewrite the stars alongside James Arthur.",True,True,60198283.0,Not Found

Lyrics
You know I got it baby what do you want?
You know I got it baby what do you need? 
She like 
She say 
She like 
She like 

You know I got it baby what do you want?
You know I got it baby what do you need? 
She like 
She like 

Yo,
I don’t only love her for the sex
But I swear to God, I love it when she says
She know that she fucking with the best
Thinking she an angel till I put her on the bed 
 
Gotta chase this money baby nuttin to be said
I ain’t having no distractions when I’m running up a cheque 
Every time I leave the crib I got you looking at me stressed,
but as soon as I’m home…
 
Face down ass up cock it right back baby how you not a model with a body like that? 
Oh god when she top me she the top of my class 
when we fuck imma copyright that 
I be on a vibe 
Money to the side, I’m just tryna live my life 
I can’t even leave without her giving me the eyes 
Babe it ain’t my fault I gotta focus on what’s mine 
Take it easy give me time

You know I got it baby what do you want 
You know I got it baby what do you need?

She want kids I want cribs in the sticks 
Girl boujee, she ain’t tryna wait til Christmas for gifts 
If I left would she miss me a bit? 
Is she riding my wave is she sinking my ship? 
Tough love yeah it literally is, 
and I know you get pissed when you’re thinking of it 
But we can still get that bling on your wrist

Get the Lamborghini white, I paint the urus like her toes,

Lyrics
Chorus:
No other name for you
Even though they call you by another
You were always my G
And you light up the room
Ever since the first day you were here
You were always my G
And if the world is cruel
I will be the last one standing here to protect you
Don't grow up too soon
For now and till forever you were always my G

Yeah
Yo G
Ha
You probably won't even understand this
So imma try and paint the picture on a canvas
Just wanna tell you you won't ever get abandoned
Can't lie I started writing and got anxious
But you’re my biggest blessing
What a life that I've been granted
One in a million couldn’t try it if we planned it
Don't mind me just fly free you’re my G

Shit ain’t easy this a different type of love
Every time we greet you get a different kind of hug
All the memories that we keep
You and me could write a book
And we’re still not done
You're my G till time is up
Out in public you walk past them they might look
Keep smiling baby girl and watch the day gone brighten up
Know I'm still with ya
I’d kill for ya
If someone tried their luck
Can’t even sip my drink
I’m spilling tears inside my cup

Knew you were special from the minute you was born
Un-identical twin but so different from them all
So happy when I met you and your sister on the ward
You know big bros here to come and lift you if you fall
I know hat will take of you when I’m gone
That's my angel she’ll be stable until I’m one
I wish Tony seen you grow but shit we ride on
Looking back at old pictures where’s the time gone

(Chorus)

Yeah
Heart broke when i found out there's a hole in yours
Had me stressed out for weeks but I cope of course
No way you would have left us
You was three months old
You got a long life ahead of you
I know there's more
To make you happy is what I’m hoping for
Can have anything you want
I took an oath I swore
Baby live your best life you shouldn’t grow by force
All in your own time G
The globe is yours
Yeah

You got us wearing odd socks on the 21st
People laugh but we’re too strong for it to ever hurt
They might try and bring you down but it’ll never work
When you smile you just light up the room
I ain’t never met a person that's brighter than you
Say I love you and i mean it every time that I do
You little shit you got me crying in the booth
Tryna do mum proud
Tryna do dad proud
Tryna do you proud
Tryna do Hat proud
That’s why I’m trying 5 years I ain’t sat down
And all I’ve heard is your voice in the background
Don't say a word before you chat I just know it
If I answer facetime you gunna ask me where Joe is
Swear to god you’re just amazing little girl
From the bottom of my heart
I wouldn't change you for the world
Yeah

(Chorus)

Lyrics
If they wanna battle I’m ready for war
I come from the struggle and love all the trouble I’ve been here before 
I’m done and I’m sick of the talk with the smiling faces, not anymore
Kick in the door
Been in the gutter I come from the mud I can give you a tour 
If they wanna battle I’m letting it loose 

I’ve been the bigger man 
And they didn’t give a damn
And I don’t wanna call a truce
And they don’t wanna hear the truth
They think it was luck that got me in the booth
Cuz I’m up and I’m eating my fruits
And they didn’t see the seed all the bleeding 
Non believing under achieving see I remember
This time I was flat on my ass
Mum lost the yard
And I’m tryna graft
Studio was just my time apart
I’d go bake off back it Muli’s yard
Scheming how we’d get our mulas up 
Stupidness for a few quid more
I thank god everyday that music buss
Think I ain’t ready
You stupid cunt 

If they wanna battle I’m ready for war
I come from the struggle and love all the trouble I’ve been here before 
I’m done and I’m sick of the talk with the smiling faces, not anymore
Kick in the door
Been in the gutter I come from the mud I can give you a tour 
If they wanna battle I’m letting it loose 

Alright I got 16, 15 left 
Armz Kelone when I lift these reps 
Hard to moan when u live this bless 
Bro don’t park the chrome he just grips and press 
Swipe and go I spent
Quids on creps
Multiply my dough when I Flip this cheque 
All I write bouts tits and sex 
I’m surprised I ain’t had no pckneys yet 
Nah I lied these man are my youts 
Spit a line and  Fire up man the booth 
Bring the ride out Stand on the roof 
man tried but you just can’t battle the truth 
Some my guys still savage a yout 
It’s not a music vid they ain’t planning a shoot
If I happens it happens its true but ..

If they wanna battle I’m ready for war
I come from the struggle and love all the trouble I’ve been here before 
I’m done and I’m sick of the talk with the smiling faces, not anymore
Kick in the door
Been in the gutter I come from the mud I can give you a tour

""NADA"" LETRA

[Cazzu]
Dijo que me está olvidando, oh-oh
Que ya no me quiere ver
Que ya tiene otra mujer
Nuestro amor está enterrando, oh-oh
Que no lo supe querer
Papi, ¿qué le voy a hacer?

Y si no siente nada, esta noche e' la indicada
Pa’ que haga lo que hacía' como cuando yo no estaba
Hoy me puse el vestido, ese que tanto te gustaba
Pa' que cuando esté en frente, me lo digas en la cara

[Cazzu & Rauw Alejandro]
Que ya no siente nada (No siente nada)
Na’ de nada (Na' de nada)
Na' de na' (Oh; ah; oh-oh-oh; nada, nada)
Que ya no siente nada' (No siente nada; oh-oeh)
Na' de nada (Oh-oeh; na' de nada)
Na' de na’ (Uh-uh; na’ de nada)

[Rauw Alejandro]
(Dice, Ra-Rauw)
No sé si tú, a mí sí me dolió (Wuh)
La noche en que esto se terminó (Wuh)
No fueron sus besos, su mirada mintió
No fui yo el que la promesa no cumplió (Yih)
¿En dónde quedó to' lo que tú me decía’? (Uh-wuh)
¿Cómo iba a saber que era una bandida? (Ey)
Su maldad se la traía escondida (Ey)
Hasta tu propia amiga me lo advertía (¡Yah!)
Salgo a ver si corro con suerte
Esperando volver a verte
Dime, dónde te escondes
Hoy la botella tiene tu nombre
Salgo a ver si corro con suerte
Esperando volver a verte
Dime, dónde te escondes (Oh-oh)
Hoy la botella tiene tu nombre

[Cazzu]
Que ya no siente nada (No siente na')
Na' de nada (Na' de nada)
Na’ de na' (Nada, nada)
Que ya no siente nada (No siente na')
Na' de nada (Na' de nada)
Na' de na' (Nada)

[Lyanno]
Bebé, no me explico cómo me cambiaste por ese tipo
Si tú bien sabe' que no es tu tipo
Y comentan que lo tiene muy chico, yeh-yeh
Yo que te lo hago rico, y hasta los vecinos se quejan de lo' grito'
Y te dedico to' lo' caption que publico
Pero si no quiere', pues, yo no quiero, a nadie le suplico
Por eso a tu nombre yo vo' a prender
Pa' borrar to' lo que fuimo' ayer
De mi bell4quera tú ere' la chófer
Y ni pa' venirte tú quiere' volver
La noche era fría y yo con gana'
Tú no aparecía' y estaba tu hermana
Fue ella la que se metió en mi cama
Porque ya tú no siente'—

[Cazzu]
Nada (No sientes nada)
Na' de nada (Na' de nada)
Na' de na' (Nada, nada)
Que ya no siente nada (Sientes nada)
Na' de nada (Na' de nada)
Na' de na' (Nada)

[Cazzu]
Yo no quiero ser mala, pero es evidente
Que se cae tu peli cuando estoy en frente
Bebé, te conozco, ¿por qué tú me miente'?
Entre to'as esas perras yo soy diferente
Y que cuando entro a la disco, tu combito se enloquece
Y tú actitu' de malo, en verdad, no es lo que parece
Y que lleva tratando de olvidarme hace diez meses
Me dijiste: ""Cada uno tiene lo que se merece""
Entonces, pa, ¿qué hago aquí? Si no soy pa' ti
Si no ere' pa' mí, ¿por qué tanto lío?
Ya te vi, desde el VIP
Pa, dime que sí, quiero estar contigo
Entonces, pa, ¿qué hago aquí? Si no soy pa' ti
Si no ere' pa' mí, ¿por qué tanto lío?
Ya te vi, desde el VIP
Pa, dime que sí, quiero estar contigo

Que ya no siente nada (No siente na')
Na' de nada (Na' de nada)
Na' de na' (Nada, nada)
Que ya no siente nada (No siente na')
Na' de nada (Na' de nada)
Na' de na' (Nada)

[Dalex]
Si él a ti te pichea, pa' mí tú ere' la indicada
Te envolviste con él, porque ante' yo no estaba
Y si él no siente nada, baby, bésame en su cara
Pa' quitarte el vestido, ese que tanto le gustaba (Uh-uh; uh-yeh)
Cuando me vea en tu' history, y se muerda
Y se sienta como m!erda
Cuando sepa que ya ni lo recuerdas
Porque conmigo te tiemblan las piernas
Te diste mucho guille y él te cambió
Par de trago' y no se aguantó
Me llamó después que salió del club
Desde esa noche conmigo se jukeó
Ahora yo la hago mía, mía
Me la robé y no fue culpa mía
Fue mala suya que no la atendió
Ahí llegué yo y le di lo que pidió, uh-yeh

[Cazzu]
Que ya no siente nada
Na' de nada
Na' de na'
Que ya no siente nada
Na' de nada
Na' de na'

""PELICULEO"" LETRA
 
Esa shorty, está puesta pal’ peliculeo
Ese culo se llevó el trofeo
Me dijo que me ama y yo le creo
Siempre ha sido mi fanática
Es fina pero media satánica
Después de la disco me la robo
De mi le gusta todo
Ya no tiene un gatito, pero es un bobo
 
CORO
Ella baila como una str!pper
Y en la cara me rebota esa nalg*ta
No le importa que critiquen
Tiene un par amigas locas pero ella es la mejor
 
Y se desata, sola se arrebata
Guata uba guata mami que linda esa gata
Lo hace por la plata, pero conmigo no
Le gustan los nenes pero ahora le gusto yo
Me gusta tu tattoo, que te llega hasta el cu
Rómpelo guacha que parezca Kun Fu
Pide lo que quiera que es largo el menú
Eligió seis nueve y frío el champú
 
CORO
Ella baila como una str!pper
Y en la cara me rebota esa nalg*ta
No le importa que critiquen
Tiene un par amigas locas pero ella es la mejor
 
Dela ghetto:
Chiquitita e’ pero cul*na
Lo que tiene es puro, no es cortao’ con acetona
Es como un golazo pal tiempo de Maradona
Llevo dandole to’ el mes y ni me menciona
 
Randy:
Préndanse los ph!lie díganme donde están
Todas las bellacas díganme donde están
Las que chichan, fuman y beben, díganme donde están
Cazzu, La Nota, el Chulito la explotan
 
De La Ghetto:
Y no le doy break
La montón en el bicho y la pongo en play
La pantera rosa toda la noche por ley
Cuando hace privado baby girl I’m paid…
Everyday hey hey hey
 
Randy:
Se viste apreta’ pa que la pinga se me pare
Con las tet4s rebotando Cazzu, casi se me sale
Pa’ que este bi me lo pare, no me lo sale
No me muerda la cabeza baby, que eso no vale
 
CORO
Ella baila como una str!pper
Y en la cara me rebota esa nalg*ta
No le importa que critiquen
Tengo par amigas locas pero ella es la mejor
 
La nena trampa
Háblame Cotton
Cazzu
 
Mmm.. mm..
 
Nota, Nota Loca
Geezy
 
Che bólido, que clase e’ palo
Argentina y Puerto Rico

Si no te atiendo el teléfono, seguro que no quiero hablar con vo'
(¿Perra? ¿Perra?)
Y de toda' la mejor (¡Wuh!)
En tu vida no vas a conocer ninguna pibita como yo (Yo)

Esos negocios ya no me interesan
Si hasta hace poco pichea-ban
Tengo la paca encima de la mesa, interrumpiste mientra' conta-ba
P*ta (P*ta), ja, p*ta pero no tarada
Debería ser abogada, no se me escapa ninguna jugada
9-8-0k, sólo en enero, pa'

Llueve money, quiero má'

Que lo haga como yo
Que tenga lo que yo
Me vive tirando, pero está intentando hacerlo como yo, eh
Largué tanta data que toda' tu' gata' me odiaban, hoy me rinden culto
Ella se pone sata si le hablo de plata y convierte en halago el insulto
Me mira como si estuviera loca, ¿y qué?
A callarle la boca ya me acostumbré
Actuando como si supiera meno' 'e lo que sé
Yo no peleo por cuero, mami, quédate con él

Ya lo probé, lo descarté; no era pa' tanto
Me lo robé, lo secuestré, perdió el encanto
¿Que llamo a quién? No sé quién e', me quiere olvidar pero ahora me pegué
Y ahora hasta su' beba' me aman, del barrio la jefa la que está sonando, b!tch (Ey)

""MALÉFICA"" LETRA

Tarde o temprano
Voy a salirme con la mía
Y todos van a ser testigos 
Te voy a hacer sentir como nunca antes te habías sentido 

Mi flow te tiene confundido 
Ya te tengo sudando frío 
Llegaste con ella pero te vas de aquí conmigo

CORO
Aaah esa cara me pone maléfica
Me descontrola, me pongo explícita
Y allá abajo te hago alguna visita 
Y si quieres más
Te doy mas para que tengas pa’ llevar
Te prometo que no te vas a olvidar
De esta loca, de esta loca.

Yo te prometo esto, que esta noche en la cama haremo’ el mejor dueto
Cuando me miras a los ojos yo me desconecto, mantengamo’ el secreto
Sabe que me pone el corazón inquieto
Así que vamo’ a ver quién de los dos gana
No quiero tu amor, pero dime que me amas
Baby esta noche no me dejes con las ganas
Quiero despertarme al lado tuyo mañana 

Tócame, vente acercando y siénteme 
Tu me estas gustando, entérate 
Que me pones maléfica, por ti ando histérica 
Sabe baby
Tócame, vente acercando y siénteme 
Tu me estas gustando, entérate 
Que me pones maléfica, por ti ando histérica 

CORO
Aaah esa cara me pone maléfica
Me descontrola, me pongo explícita
Y allá abajo te hago alguna visita 
Y si quieres más
Te doy mas para que tengas pa’ llevar
Te prometo que no te vas a olvidar
De esta loca, de esta loca.

Bizcochito dame un beso con sabor a caramelo 
No tengas miedo agarrarme por el pelo
A muerte es este duelo Pam Pam 
Pa’ matarte en el suelo 
Como dije Pam Pam y pálida, duro
Que te va a gustar te lo aseguro
Te deje la puerta sin seguro 
Pa’ que juguemo’ al cuarto oscuro 

Tócame, me estas calentando, siénteme 
Tu me estas matando, entérate 
Que me pones maléfica, por ti ando histérica 
Tócame, me estas calentando, siénteme 
Tu me estas matando, entérate 
Que me pones maléfica, por ti ando histérica 
 
CORO
Aaah esa cara me pone maléfica
Me descontrola, me pongo explícita
Y allá abajo te hago alguna visita 
Y si quieres más
Te doy mas para que tengas pa’ llevar
Te prometo que no te vas a olvidar
De esta loca, de esta loca.

LETRA

[Intro]
No esperes que me muera, baby, pa' extrañarme
Se marchitó la flor
Dime si queda amor, pa así no olvidarme
De todo el tiempo que perdí, lo que pediste te lo di
Mentiras que te creí, como loco te perseguí
Pa' nada, malvada, tú me manipulabas
Diciendo que me amabas, esta tormenta no acaba

[Coro]
Y ahora estoy de party
Tú estás llorando
Con quién estoy te pasas preguntando
Ya yo te olvidé, de tu amor me curé
Y ahora estoy de party
Sigues llorando
Con quién estoy te pasas preguntando
Lo nuestro lo enterré y tu foto la borré

[Verso 1: Mora]
Lo nuestro lo enterré, búscalo en el cementerio
Baby, te fuiste a criterio
Tú nunca lo cogiste en serio
Llevando la contraria, yo buscando un punto medio
Tratando de salvar la relación
Y tú pagando con traición
Si estabas conmigo era para llamar la atención
Ese cariño tuyo era de silicón
Un amor de mentira
Llegaste cuando estaba en alto y te fuiste en la caída
Cupido te escribo, pero te fuiste a la huida
Quizá en la próxima vida

[Coro]
Y ahora estoy de party
Tú estás llorando
Con quién estoy te pasas preguntando
Ya yo te olvidé, de tu amor me curé
Y ahora estoy de party
Sigues llorando
Con quién estoy te pasas preguntando
Lo nuestro lo enterré y tus fotos las borré

[Verso 2: Cazzu]
Ya no me escribas para explicarme
Nada de lo que digas va a consolarme
Andamos en guerra y si quieres probarme
Vas a aprender que no puedes ganarme
Cuando tú te fuiste se borró todo el millaje
Te mandé a volar, papi, te saqué un pasaje
Tengo un flow cabrón y eso que ni me lo traje
Si quiere competir, entonces me pongo salvaje
Sé que vas a llorar
Y que te vas a acordar
De todo lo que te hice
Pero sanaron las cicatrices

[Coro]
Y ahora estoy de party
Tú estás llorando
Con quién estoy te pasas preguntando
Ya yo te olvidé, de tu amor me curé
Y ahora estoy de party
Sigues llorando
Con quién estoy te pasas preguntando
Lo nuestro lo enterré y tu foto la borré

LETRA:

Y no soy así 
Pero siempre termino en la misma cuando bebo Hennessy
Dime que fue lo que paso ayer 

Baby tengo una botella de Hennessy
Una rubia que parece Tennessee 
Casi casi no fuimos del paci
Para ver netflix pero no eres así

Baby tengo una botella de Hennessy
Con una rubia parece de Tennessee 
Casi casi no fuimos del placi
Para ver netflix pero no eres así

Yeh, quiero un finde en Miami eso lo se
Tres cero cinco y la cinco doce 
Nalgas redondas le digo la percocet
Se lo pongo después dice que no me conoce
Ja, Dímelo José que ya no estamos imitando voces
Podemos pedirte unas cuantas botellas de rosé, pero yo sé
Como que a ti te gusta el hennessy
Tu boca me dice que no pero en tu mente esta diciéndote que si
Dime que fue lo que paso ayel 

Baby tengo una botella de Hennessy
Una rubia que parece Tennessee 
Casi casi no fuimos del paci
Para ver netflix pero no eres así

Ey ey ey Ferrari enzo
Ya estoy al nivel que ni pienso 
Por el humo humo humo intenso 
Otra botella de henny otro fili otro twenty
Lo que tu pagas de casa yo lo tengo en cada tenis 
Phillip plein Jimmy Chu que lo que dime mami dame luz 
También tengo balmain pero 
tu no quieres roce mami porque yo se que lo tuyo es Hennessy
Baby, tu boca me dice que no pero tu mente esta diciéndome que si
Dime que fue lo que paso ayer

Baby tengo una botella de Hennessy
Una rubia que parece Tennessee 
Casi casi no fuimos del paci
Para ver netflix pero no eres así

Baby tengo una botella de Hennessy
Dime si esta noche estás puesto pa’ mi
Casi casi no fuimos del paci
Para ver netflix pero no eres así

Baby de anoche no me acuerdo
Todavía sigo que me pierdo
Solo se que yo te llamé te dije te quiero ver 
Me dijiste deja eso mami
Eres tu dame luz donde es que te metiste
Es por el Hennessy que no me atendiste
O por que le dije a tu amigo si es que pregunta no le diga que me viste 
Tengo Hennessy yo le dije que no pero el sigue insistiéndome que si 
Dime que fue lo que paso ayer 

Baby tengo una botella de Hennessy
Con Una rubia que parece Tennessee 
Casi casi no fuimos del paci
Para ver netflix pero no eres así

Lyrics :

Yeah
Aujourd'hui c'est ma Salomé (yeah, yeah)
Le passé c'est eux, le futur c'est nous, bébé (ah, yeah)
Aujourd'hui c'est ma Salomé (ma Salomé, yeah, ah)
Le passé c'est eux, le futur c'est nous, ouais
Le passé c'est eux (yeah, yeah)
Le passé c'est eux (yeah)
Yeah, yeah
Le passé c'est eux, le futur c'est nous (bah ouais)
À l'époque on mangeait des clous
Aujourd'hui c'est mieux et j'étais pas fou
Quand j'te disais qu'on verrait le bout (j'te l'avait dit)
Le passé c'est eux, le futur c'est nous (bah ouais)
Et tout s'est passé comme on a dit (bah ouais)
À l'époque y avait pas un radis (non)
Ça s'échangeait fort les mêmes habits, yeah (toujours, toujours)
Mais t'es restée là toi, ouais (ouais t'es restée)
T'es pas comme les autres toi, non (t'es pas comme les autres)
T'es restée la même (bah ouais) c'est pour ça que je t'aime (bah ouais)
Plus forte que les quatre saisons
Bah ouais t'es ma femme toi, pas une tipère, une foumasse ou racli
Écoute bien ce que yema nous a dit, une femme doit honorer son mari
Et si ils te parlent, et si ils me cherchent, dis leurs qu'on est mariés
Qu'on a tourné le sablier, qu'y a déjà quelqu'un dans ton barillet
Et si ils te veulent, ou si elles me veulent dis leur que c'est mort
Préviens moi quand tu sors, les méchants sont cachés dehors
Salomé, Salomé, Salomé
Salomé, Salomé, Salomé
Salomé, Salomé, Salomé
Salomé, Salomé, Salomé
On connaît toute la ville, et toute la city nous connaît (she knows)
On a su viser dans le mile (yeah) t'as prié Dieu, a donné (you know)
Et quand tu dors la nuit (yeah) là c'est mon tour (ah, ah) c'est mon tour (ah, ah)
Moi je ne dors que le jour (ah, ah) tout comme le gérant du four, yah
Regarde-moi dans les yeux et promets le moi
Qu'on finira à deux comme la fin du mois (na, na, na)
Regarde-moi dans les yeux et promets le moi (promets le moi, promets le moi, promets le moi)
Et si ils te parlent, et si ils me cherchent, dis leurs qu'on est mariés (dis leurs qu'on est mariés)
Qu'on a tourné le sablier, qu'y a déjà quelqu'un dans ton barrillet (yeah, yeah)
Et si ils te veulent, ou si elles me veulent dis leurs que c'est mort (c'est mort)
Préviens moi quand tu sors (sors) les méchants sont cachés dehors

Paroles : 

Iiiiih
Iiiihhhh
Oohohoh
Menedo x7
Mami ouh mami x7

Refrain :
Oh le temps, le temps m’a réparé
Plus rien n’est comme avant 
Quelqu’un m’a déjà soigné
Ooh le vent, le vent a bien tourné
Ne gaspille pas mon temps
Une autre a su me soigner  

Toi la tu disparais sans laisser un mot 
T’as préféré fuir comme un enfant, partir sans te retourner
J’tai prêté mon coeur et tu lui as donné ton dos 
Toi tu m’as fais gaspiller mon temps, 
Tu n’ma pas laisser parler
Aahhhiiiii
Et maintenant, tu reviens, et comme avant, 
tu espère retrouver celui qui t’as aimé, celui avec qui t’as joué
Et maintenant, maintenant c’est toi qui veut parler
Et toute tes meilleures phrases tu veux les caler
Ne gaspille pas mon temps 

Refrain :
Oh le temps, le temps m’a réparé
Plus rien n’est comme avant 
Quelqu’un m’a déjà soigné
Ooh le vent, le vent a bien tourné
Ne gaspille pas mon temps
Une autre a su me soigner  

Ne me fais pas croire que j’nai pas fais c’quil faut
Moi je t’ai fais passer avant tout
J’en ai perdu la raison
Sans aucun remords toi t’as tout jeté à l’eau
J’étais devenu accro à ton goût
Le goût de ton poison.
Mais maintenant, moi ça va, avec toi
J’avais comme l’impression de devoir supplier
Pour quelque chose que tu me dois non
Maintenant toi tu veux enfin m’entendre
On s’est arrêté tu veux reprendre

Refrain : 
Oh le temps, le temps m’a réparé
Plus rien n’est comme avant 
Quelqu’un m’a déjà soigné
Ooh le vent, le vent a bien tourné
Ne gaspille pas mon temps
Une autre a su me soigner

Menedo x7
Mami ouh mami x7

Lyrics
[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Bitch, we in the city on that hot shit
Lookin' for a bitty on that thot shit
Y’all ain't gettin' money, nigga, stop this
I been ’round the globe talkin' hot shit
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
Bitch, we in the city on that hot shit
Lookin' for a bitty on that thot shit
Y'all ain't gettin' money, nigga, stop this
I been 'round the globe talkin' hot shit
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
I do my own shit, I don’t need 50 niggas to roll with
Folk shit, I’m on my doley, I'm on my boss shit
I do my own shit, fuck all them niggas I used to roll with
I know you used to see me with niggas, but that’s that old shit
Real nigga, quick to pull a fucking trigger
Fed nigga's definition of a real nigga
Fuck nigga, quick to fuckin' hate, nigga
Bitch nigga, definition of a bitch nigga
Now wildin', ready for all the violence
I don’t need a nigga jacking that he riding
I got this four fifth, this shit all up on my hip
I blow that shit, now you where Bobby Shmurda's hat went!

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Bitch, we in the city on that hot shit
Lookin' for a bitty on that thot shit
Y'all ain't gettin' money, nigga, stop this
I been 'round the globe talkin' hot shit
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it

[Verse 2: 6ix9ine]
Kick her out, I'm gettin' money now, actin' funny now
Thought she love me, but she only tryna fuck me for the clout
Saw the Patek all bust down, charter run down
Bitch hit me on a touchdown, but I curved it
They be beggin' me to keep the bitch, but I don't need the bitch
Ray Charles, John Cena shit, I can't see the bitch
In the DM sendin' naked pics, Uber that bitch
But I send her in the pool even though I'm rich as shit

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
It's fuckin' Tr—
Oh wait, I forgot you can't say that shit
You can go start with everything else that start with a T, though
It's fuckin' Trojan
It's fuckin' Target
It's fuckin'—

I got my head out the sunroof
I’m blasting our favorite tunes
I only got one thing on my mind

You got me stuck on the thought of you
You’re making me feel brand new
You’re more than a sunshine in my eyes

You got those
Pretty eyes in your head, you know it
You got me dancing in my bed, so let me show it 
You are exactly what I want,
Kinda cool and kinda not
Wanna give myself to you 
Yeah, We’re driving down the freeway at night
I only got one thing in the back of My mind
I’m feeling like this might be my time to shine with you with you with you 

I got my head out the sunroof
I’m blasting our favorite tunes
I only got one thing on my mind

You got me stuck on the thought of you
You're making me feel brand new
You’re more than a sunshine in my eyes

I got my head out the sunroof 
Woah woah

""""We Paid"""" Lyrics:

[Intro: 42 Dugg]
Can't be fucked with
Ayy, 4 Pockets, huh
(Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)

[Verse 1: 42 Dugg]
'Fore I go broke like Joc
Fuck with that dog like Vick (Roof)
Not that rock, that pit'
Palm Angels down to my sock
Can't hold my Glock, reason I don't really like that shit (Nigga, I don't)
Young turnt nigga, can't wife no bitch (At all)
Excuse my French, don't like no bitch (Nope)
Limo tinted, all five of my cars, yeah, I had it hard
Seen my bitch broke bad, I ain't had a heart
Skrrt, yeah, that's us
Two-tone AP, yeah, I'm bust
Got the head from her, I ain't even wanna fuck (Fuck her)
Why? Slut, bye (Fuck on)
Nothin' on me from Saks, everything Revive
Old nigga tellin' on bro, should've died
No, he ain't kill 'em, dawg, he ain't even try
Still'll bet my last shootin' dice in the hood
Take who chain? Nah bitch, not Dugg's
Probably in somethin' fast with a Glock in the hood
Courtside tickets, spillin' Wock' on the wood

[Chorus: 42 Dugg & Lil Baby]
First turnt nigga from the hood, they curious
Four in cars, 'bout five in jewelry
I get the commas with numbers, that's period
I got your BM wan' put on Amiris
First young nigga in the A with two Lams
Run up fourteen mil', started fourteen grams (Same day)
Dope boy Dickies and diamonds and Timbs
You shouldn't play with that boy, he is not one of them
Bro, I kept taking L's, finally got me a M
Still making double, I don't count what I spend
S550 2018
Gotta come twenty if you hoppin' in the Benz
Young turnt nigga from the D to the A
I'm rockin' with the Lions, yeah, I'm rocking with the Braves
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we paid
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we paid

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn it up a lil' more this time
Used to dream about gettin' it, now I got it, I don't drive
I had a spot like a varsity, what do you have?
You buy twenty, I'll front what you buy
I put on drip, I believe I can I fly
Niggas know that I'm rich, but they know not to try
I had a show in Detroit and I stopped at Revive
And spent fifty on all the guys
All of these hoes in these stores make commission
And plus I'ma tip 'em, they holdin' my size
Get in your car and just put on your flashers
And follow the hearse since you say you gon' ride
'Cause somebody gon' die if they fuck with us
Turn a five to a dime, that's a double up
Fuck around, walk through church with my double cup
This shit a habit, I'm prayin' I give it up
Tiger stay with the wood, make 'em give it up
Know I ran through a mil' every week coppin' weed
Bruh beat the charge, I can get me some sleep
Got a backend to pick up, I won't even leave
Run it up, fuck around, give the 'Vette to DT
Keep a hotboy with me, I got love for BG
Chasin' this paper since twelve or thirteen
Runnin' 'round in these streets, it was me and Marquise

[Chorus: 42 Dugg & Lil Baby]
First turnt nigga from the hood, they curious
Four in cars, 'bout five in jewelry
I get the commas with numbers, that's period
I got your BM wan' put on Amiris
First young nigga in the A with two Lams
Run up fourteen mil', started fourteen grams (Same day)
Dope boy Dickies and diamonds and Timbs
You shouldn't play with that boy, he is not one of them
Bro, I kept taking L's, finally got me a M
Still making double, I don't count what I spend
S550 2018
Gotta come twenty if you hoppin' in the Benz
Young turnt nigga from the D to the A
I'm rockin' with the Lions, yeah, I'm rocking with the Braves
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we paid
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we paid
First turnt nigga from the hood, they curious
Four in cars, 'bout five in jewelry
I get the commas with numbers, that's period
I got your BM wan' put on Amiris
First young nigga in the A with two Lams
Run up fourteen mil', started fourteen grams (Same day)
Dope boy Dickies and diamonds and Timbs
You shouldn't play with that boy, he is not one of them
Bro, I kept taking L's, finally got me a M

Gotta come twenty if you hoppin' in the Benz
Young turnt nigga from the D to the A

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we paid
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we paid (Yeah)

[Verse 1: 42 Dugg & Lil Baby]
Got a lotta new flames need 'em blue
Three hundred fifty thou', times that by two
New down the roof, I still the sky
Peace to my grandma, I still see my guys
Hurtin' this bad must feel like dyin'
Heard a thou' seven hundred, what you gon' bet now?
Yeah, you used to twerk bitch, a vet now
Luke, get up, doggy, I need you
Only nigga made sure that I was eatin'
Free Nef still, nigga, RIP Reese
Get her nails done, still charge for the feature
Baby, we ain't that, nah, we ain't this
All that fuckin', I don't do no kiss
Bitch ain't shit, word to my niggas
All in my mansions (Yeah)
Bitch really wanna get higher
Tell the lil' hoes I'm Bryson
I done hit more shit than Mike Tyson
Get popped, nigga, I ain't doin' no fight
Sendin' my cash, I ain't doin' no right
Car too fast, can't stop at no light
I hit the gas, skrrt and I pull off
I'm on they ass, I just took a year off
She shakin' her ass, call me when she get off
Took half a mil' for my lil' bro to get out
That new Richard Mille made me feel like a boss
Feel like I'm Meech when I'm runnin' these cars
Who you know? Pull up, whole entourage in a foreign
I got designer for days but it's somethin' about 'em
Go crazy for white Air Force One, maybe 'cause I'm a dope boy
He be live but he ain't makin' no noise
'Ventador on the ground like a skateboard
If I want it, I get it, I pay for it
I pay extra, I ain't tryna wait for it
Everything that I got, it was made for me
I was servin' them trap houses faithfully
Everybody with me gotta eat
Say you grace with me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Right back on it, designer my garments
Corner store mornings, there until the sun down
I don't trust no one, I can't put my gun down
Goin' number one now, how this sound?
Hands down, bands out, pants down, yeah, I'm thuggin'
I done got rich, everybody my cousin
He ain't servin' no packs with me, he ain't my brother
El Chapo go through shit, I call her """"The Cutter""""
I just bought a new whip, I went bought another
My mother, she happy now
Ain't no cap and gown, but I graduated
Her house paid for, and that new Mercedes
Know you that they been tryna be me lately
I'm a heavy hitter like Gervonta Davis
That shit ain't gon' save 'em, leave 'em on the pavement
All I know is get this motherfuckin' paper

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name (Hello?)
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah

[Verse 3: 42 Dugg]
Bitches ain't shit, doggybone, I get it
Fell in love twice, had me in my feelings
Three months, dropped damn near a half a million
Nigga, fuck a house, I damn near lost a building
Fucked nigga's hoes, so he say he wanna kill me
I miss Terri, she was different
I miss Nef, rest in peace to my nigga
Damn near wasn't there when they told me they killed you
Try and rat? Nigga, fuck on
Thirteen thou' VVS, Buffs on
Still a flooded nigga, time worth a truckload
Get to hatin', I'm out, I don't trust hoes
If the feds in the house, a nigga told on me
I pray to God my soul to keep
G5, just be as murder
Gotta get picked up, doggy I'm hurt
Still paid the lawyer even though I'm nervous

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah

Lyrics:
Only love I ever felt was from my mama
(On my mama)
Miss my grandma
Miss my uncle
Rest in peace
Neff and reese

Cash out
Thick bitch from the west side
Cashed out 
Nah this is not a S class
Maybach 
I've been turnin up for my city
I've been turnin up for my city

Richy rich
Fuck her then I leave 
Bitch aint no gimme kiss 
All or nothing
Free bitch call me dugg
And i don't call her nothing

She finessin
Bae I need a dime
What else
Bae i need a 
Yeah 
Leave a message
Dog you know I’m for doggin hoes
Bae I changed 
Fuck all them hoes
Take her shoppin she be fly

Hermes chanel and prada
Gucci clothes matchin my mama
21 brand new no mileage
Fuck nigga before I start wylin
Coming down 6’s bron
Ticking bomb
Sippin don perignon

My bitches fine
Glizzy nine
Play and get shot

I still miss my pops
When is you gettin out
I've been turnin up for my city (turn me up)
I've been turnin up for my city

Tell Dez made me some noodles
 turned my young bitch into a shooter
Damn I miss OG double
Taught me how to pimp and hustle 
I go and hit a lick
You can go and ask bubba

Uh
Bitch blocks
Totin real choppas
Whole lotta shooters
You don't want no problems

RIP june bug 
Toppy in the broad day
Tryna pay this lawyer for my lil ones
 gonna be a cold case

Magic city
I'm the owner
Tell steve harvey 
Ion want her
One thing i never seen was a bitch to leave
Every time i crank the car ion use a key

Push start
Foreign whip
Two glizzys
Extended clips
Ion go a day being sober
Pour a lot of dope in my soda
Magic city
I'm the owner
Tell steve harvey
Ion want her

6’s bron
Ticking bomb 
Sippin don perignon

Big ridin
Really ima don
Made these bitches wave live

I done came out the muddy
I done put the most white diamonds
On the blackest hoes
I'm just turnin up for my city
I'm just turnin up for my city
I'm just turnin up for my city (turn me up)

I've been turning up for my city
Grandma daddy mama sister
I've been through so much lately 

Run it up then stash it
Damn near 2 million on the mansion
CMG thats who im signed to
But I like my pockets full

I got my game from the streets
I barely went to school
I know now dugg 
Slow down shot
Four times
I don't really like to squash it 
On my daddy on my mama
I don't really like to squash it

Lyrics:

EST GEE
Everybody shooters too
We can’t be intuitive
If I ain’t shoot at you
I’m who all the gangster young third niggas
Look up to
I’m who all the opps and robbers
Plan on tryna doing it too
I’m who all the project and the model hoes
Wanna do it too
She put it on her head
And twist her hands like the screw is loose
You talk like you bulletproof
We all really know the truth
They know we the reason for them candle-light vigils
Niggas can’t be serious
They funny
He think he the big dog on his block

Cause he got money
Last one got outta line
Went against the guys
Got punished
Meanwhile I’m thuggin’
Pullin’ pounds outta luggage
Sold it in Kentucky
But our pressure did a number
7-4 124
QP 1900
You found out you can hustle
You a killer all or sum
Sometimes I wish I coulda left with red
God made me suffer
But pressure made me tougher
When it smoke I don’t be ducking
You see me out in public
With it out
I never tuck it
They say it’s all or nothing

42 DUGG
So I’m going for it
Fuck it
Million dollar budget
That’s an all fast nigga
Still rentin’ in the city
I bought all mines
I ain’t been the same
Since my dog died
Run off you get hog-tied
Silly
He ratted out on Philly
On my mama I should kill him
Young free bitch
Still would stuff it all for me
I was just in the county
Could you make a call for me
No we don’t fuck with percs
Young nigga want a puppy
My bad if I can sense it
To my younger mom and dad
I ain’t use to people passin
I’m used to homicides

I ain’t wanna buy that ass
And I got the years
Probably the only young rich nigga
Without veneers
Before I forget to mention bitch
I got an imagery
Literally
Instagram killin’ me
That savage shit still in me
I pass
No doggy this for type nigga
I rap
This for O
Said I can’t
Look at me now
Real niggas hold up
Wait til we drop city
In they feelings
Main man from the country
Remember I ain’t have a dollar
I just had a buggy
Now I’m getting money

I got lavish shit
Pay for it all cash
I’ll crash this bitch
