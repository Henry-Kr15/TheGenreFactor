Short hair like Nia Long
Loose one she don't need a loan
She start twerking when she hear a song
The stripper pole her income
We get trippy and then some
So nasty when she rolling
She put that ass off in my hands
I remote control it
She give me dome when the roof gone
At the K.O.D. she leave with me
She got friends bring three
I got drugs I got drinks
Bend it over, Juicy J gone poke it like wet paint
You say no to ratchet pussy Juicy J can't
Racks everywhere, they're showing racks I'm throwing racks
In the VIP rubber on I'm stretching that
Rich niggas tipping
Broke niggas looking
And it ain't a strip club if they ain't showing pussy.

Pull out my black card, that's my lil' nigga

Smokin' on Keysha, Cole give me chills nigga
What's your real name, and not your stripper name
I make it rain on ya, like a windowpane
Bands a make her dance, Tunechi make her cum
Hit it from the side like a motherfuckin' bass drum
Two hoes on one fuckin' pole
Two hoes on my fuckin' pole
I don't tip, I pay bills
Bitches call me Buffalo
Her stomach in, her ass out
I'm flyer than the ones they pass out
If money grow on trees, I branched out
I'm just waitin' for my bitch to cash out!

Let me see that ass clap, standing ovation
If yo girl don't swallow kids, man that hoe basic
Got two bitches with me, take a shot of one hoe
Using her friend for a chaser
Bands a make her buss it, buss it
Let me see you touch it, touch it
Money talk you ain't got none, end of discussion
Bands a make her do it, do it
Pocket full of money, money
Young nigga getting head while the engine's runnin'
Err! Let me see you wiggle do it for a real nigga
I be laughing to the bank, all you do is giggle
Balling in my coupe, call it sports car
Drop the top and freaking treat
That bitch just like a porn star

- LYRICS -
[Intro: Juicy J]
Yo, too damn high

[Hook: Juicy J] (x2)
This OG Kush, what I'm smokin' nigga
Put the fire to a hater, and smoke a nigga
I pull them whips out, and I'm smokin' nigga
You think you hot as me, hold on, you must be smokin' nigga

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Cali weed in a dutch, purple lean in my cup
Smokin' while I'm drivin', nigga we be fucked up
Hit the weed then pass out, homie you an amateur
This bitch is bad as fuck so I'mma grab that camera bruh
Peelin' bank rolls , Condo full of bad bitches
Lot of pills, lot of weed, and a lot of liquor
Sprinkle hash on a blunt bitch Im rich and double cup
Ain't no time bein' wasted time to roll another up
Trippy niggas getting high, man that's what we all do
She know I'm with them Taylors, wanna fuck the whole crew
Smokin' out the phantom Rolls, tryna stay low key
If what's in the air then you know its me

[Hook]
This OG Kush, what I'm smokin' nigga
Put the fire to a hater, and smoke a nigga
I pull them whips out, and I'm smokin' nigga
You think you hot as me, hold on, you must be smokin' nigga

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Smokin' on this potent, feelin' like I'm floatin'
Lookin' like I'm Chinese cause my eyes are barely open
Weed in my king size and right beside me got that potion
Rollin' up that ganja all my diamonds like the ocean
All looked like I cloned em, all look like they glowin'
All look like they snowin', I should build a snowman
Pulled out my garage to show my car cause I'm a showman
Can't get in my closet cause I got all of this clothin'
Smokin' out Ill show you how to roll one up and blow it down
I'm on the stage you in the crowd I'm in the air you on the ground
You on that uh, I'm on that loud
I'm on that island Veuve Clicquot money pilin'

[Hook]
This OG Kush, what I'm smokin' nigga
Put the fire to a hater, and smoke a nigga
I pull them whips out, and I'm smokin' nigga
You think you hot as me, hold on, you must be smokin' nigga

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
I got a bad bitch on a hash pipe, and that ass right
I don't know Lil shawty name, I just call her last night
Ballin' hard coppin' foreign cars like they half price
Blowin' loud, Juicy J be higher than the gas price
Mary Jane, bitch I get so high call me Eddie Kane
Freaky bitch, and she drippin' wet, its a hurricane
Dope boy, I got it on my own, I come from sellin' stones [?]
Old school, nigga getting neck like a herringbone
Codeine all in my cup, I got your queen all on my nuts
I spray she drink it up, that's right she freaky as fuck
Trippy nigga fresh to death, like the after life
Juicy J I feel outta space, cause I'm gettin' higher than a satellite

[Hook]
This OG Kush, what I'm smokin' nigga
Put the fire to a hater, and smoke a nigga
I pull them whips out, and I'm smokin' nigga
You think you hot as me, hold on, you must be smokin' nigga",False,False,90272124.0,Southern hip hop

Lyrics:

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Hey, I'mma visit the sky today
Hey, I'mma dance on the clouds today
And make it rain, on everybody beneath us
Just cause they try, doesn't mean they can be us
No, nobody can be us

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I'm tryna sink in some gin
I need, I need, I need, I need
And all this Hennessy got niggas in here hating on me, on me, on me
But if the neighbors know my name then, then I'm doing something right
And if their mamas know my name, and if their homies know my name then
Then I'm doing something right
And if their girlfriends know my name
Just cos she loves you, don't mean she understands
I don't give a damn, I'll make her fuck the band
[Sample:] I love the guitars
I already know, I've seen her at my show banging out XO
And her friend's a freak
She can't feel her throat, she can't feel her knees
And I'm not tryna talk
And I'm not tryna walk
Just lift me out the club

[Hook: The Weeknd and Juicy J]
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
Weed blowing, champagne poppin
Got that drink flowing, champagne poppin

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Pounds of weed, Sour D
That medical for my allergies
In the hotel with your girl
For 'bout a week, shootin' a shower scene
She a bad chick like Bonnie Parker
Rolled the blunts in my flying saucer
Juicy J - the new skywalker, I'll put your ho in a body auction
When I'm having fun, I'm still getting paid
Got a whole lot of mud in my Minute Maid
Stay riding through the city with my twelve gauge
Hating ass niggas, get it any day
Got a house on the hill cost a couple of mill
Juicy J got bank like uncle Phil
Keep snow bunnies that like popping pills
Keep a double cup, I like cracking seals
Y'all niggas shit, I'm still going strong
Bought the loudpack now I'm in my zone (in my zone)
Rolls Royce got me feeling like King Tut
Got my codeine cups, bout to drink up
If you're talking about money, we can link up
Bad red boned bitch, body inked up!
Your girlfriend coming home with me
And when she alone with me, she gonna suck dick and she don't spit
Or I'mma put that bitch back on the streets
I'm kickin' it with girls that be going bi
Cos their pussy is the best and their head fire

[Hook]
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
Weed blowing, champagne poppin
Got that drink flowing, champagne poppin

[Outro: The Weeknd]
Girl, I'mma visit the sky today
Hey, I'mma dance on the clouds today
And make it rain, on everybody beneath us
Just cause they try, doesn't mean they can be us
No, nobody can be us

[Hook x2]
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
Weed blowing, champagne poppin
Got that drink flowing, champagne poppin

One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
Weed blowing, champagne poppin
Got that drink flowing, champagne poppin

Lyrics:

Yeah... yeah, we gon' stay trippy for life, mane
Yeah... I'm 'bout to take yo' girl (bounce it)
Check it...

[Chorus: Trey Songz (Juicy J)]
Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I'm about to throw a couple thousand (bounce it)
Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
(Ones, fives, tens, twenties)
(Work your way up to them big face hundreds - just bounce it)
Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I'm about to throw a couple thousand

[Juicy J]
Yessir...
I love the way she slow dance, she make me throw more bands
Grabbin' ass with both hands, she in love with the dope man
She wanna be my main chick, I was thinking different (different)
Clap that ass, light our blunt, baby, let's get ig'nant (ig'nant)
She's strips with the Gs, breaks cash like Li, she got double Ds, and ain't shit free
Came with my goons but I'm leaving with a diva with an ass like Serena and a face like Aaliyah
Redbone in some red bottoms, she ain't finished college, she a head doctor
Bouncing ass while I'm getting high as propellers on a helicopter
Let's do it again, me, you and your friend
We don't even need a room, give me head up in my Benz
Where my double cup, time to pour it up
Got a bitch so bad you can't afford to fuck
Bounce it

[Chorus]

[Wale]
Wale though, le'go...
Hands is on her you know what, 'cause bandz a make her you know what
And I can make a girl break fast, my pants be on that too much lust
And I'm 'bout whatever baby, take a photo, I'm looking good
And these breezies are so beneath you, understand you're misunderstood
Premium leather goods, we pay whatever for it
All of these pussy niggas, only under influenced
Throw a block up then I back out, like that, roll a pack out, took a light hit, might nap
Got a thick bitch with a trip stick I'ma smack, and a bucket but we nothing but pack
Bald-headed scallywag, real niggas salute me
Catch me at that Memphis game, seats saved by Rudy
Or Mark Gasol, or Selby do, that's plenty dough
That's Juicy J, Folarin, got it then get me those
Ralph!

[Chorus]

[Juicy J]
Turn up...
Juicy be trippy and paid up like Diddy, toss up that cash and she show me her kitty
Got some white girl and a white girl, doin' a tiny line off of her titty
Ain't tryna fuck, I just found a replacement, feelin' so global, I think I need agent
Ratchet on deck and they know I'm gon' stunt, I'm tryna get head while smoking a blunt
Take her to my hotel, beat the pussy up, I don't know her name, but I wanna fuck
Along came Molly, then came Doobie, then codeine in a styrofoam cup
See me in the club, bands pop, they poppin', do it real good, might take you shoppin'
All these racks can't fit in my pocket, keep that stack, hundred K in the stocking
Then it's back to my room, she come out her dress
Slob on my knob, think you know the rest
I don't buy these broads Nike, but I keep these girls in check
Working for that money, bitch, you gon' have to break a sweat
Bounce it

Por que no supiste entender a mi corazon 
Lo que habia en el por que no tuviste el valor de ver quien soy 
Por que no escuchas lo que esta tan cerca de ti 
Solo el ruido de afuera y yo 
Estoy a un lado desaparezco para ti 

No voy a llorar y decir 
Que no merezco esto 
Por que 
Es probable que 
Lo merezco, pero no lo quiero por eso me voy

Letras:

Tengo que confesar que a veces, no me gusta tu forma de ser, 
luego te me desapareces y no entioendo muy bien por qué? 
No dices nada romántico cuando llega el atardecer, 
te pones de un humor extraño con cada luna llena al mes. 

Pero todo lo demás le gana lo bueno que me das, 
solo tenerte cerca, siento que vuelvo a empezar. 

Yo te quiero con limón y sal, yo te quiero tal 
y como estas no hace falta cambiarte nada. 
Yo te quiero si vienes o si vas, si subes 
y bajas si no estas seguro de lo que sientes.

Letra

Eres para mí
Me lo ha dicho el viento
Eres para mí
Lo oigo todo el tiempo

Eres para mí
Me lo ha dicho el viento
Eres para mí

La sombra que pasa, la luz que me abraza, tus ojos mirándome
La calle que canta su canto de diario, el mundo moviéndose
Y yo sé que tienes miedo y no es un buen momento para ti
Ni para esto que nos viene sucediendo

Pero eres para mí
Me lo ha dicho el viento
Eres para mí
Lo oigo todo el tiempo
Eres para mí
Me lo ha dicho el viento
Eres para mí

El espejo que da su reflejo en todo lo pinta tal como es
Mi cuerpo que no tiene peso si escucho tu voz llamándome
Y yo sé que tienes miedo y no es un buen momento para ti
Ni para esto que nos viene sucediendo

Temes sentir más de la cuenta
El corazón es un músculo si no late revienta
Extraño mirarte de lejos, de hacernos los tontos
Parecemos tan viejos, tiempo, mmm
¿Quieres más tiempo?
Mírame la piel, ¿no ves acaso lo que siento?
Tú eres para mí, yo soy para ti
El viento me lo dijo con un soplo suavecillo

Y yo sé que tienes miedo y no es un buen momento para ti
(Para mí)
Ni para esto que nos viene sucediendo

Pero eres para mí
Me lo ha dicho el viento
Eres para mí
Lo oigo todo el tiempo

Eres para mí
(Tal para cual como el mar y la sal)
Me lo ha dicho el viento
Eres para mí 
(Sigue mi cadencia pierdo la paciencia)
(Tú eres para mí, ¿no te das cuenta?)
Eres para mí 
(Tú eres para mí, yo soy para ti)
(El viento me lo dijo con un soplo suavecillo)
Eres para mí 
(Tú eres para mí)
Lo oigo todo el tiempo
Eres para mí 
(Tú eres para mí)
Me lo ha dicho el viento
(Yo soy para ti)
Eres para mí 
(Tú eres para mí)
Lo oigo todo el tiempo
(Yo soy para ti)
Eres para mí

Eres para mí
(Tú eres para mí, yo soy para ti)
Eres para mí
(Tú eres para mí, yo soy para ti)
(Tú eres para mí, yo soy para ti)

Letras 🎵

Si quieres un poco de mí
Me deberías esperar
Y caminar a paso lento
Muy lento

Y poco a poco olvidar,
El tiempo y su velocidad
Frenar el ritmo, ir muy lento
Más lento

Ser delicado y esperar
Dame tiempo para darte
Todo lo que tengo

Ser delicado y esperar
Dame tiempo para darte
Todo lo que tengo

Si quieres un poco de mí
Dame paciencia y verás
Será mejor que andar corriendo
Levantar vuelo

Y poco a poco olvidar
El tiempo y su velocidad
Frenar el ritmo, ir muy lento
Cada vez más lento

Ser delicado y esperar
Dame tiempo para darte
Todo lo que tengo

Ser delicado y esperar
Dame tiempo para darte
Todo lo que tengo
(Todo lo que tengo)

Si me hablas de amor
Si suavizas mi vida
No estaré más tiempo
Sin saber qué siento

Ser delicado y esperar
Dame tiempo para darte
Todo lo que tengo

Ser delicado y esperar
Dame tiempo para darte
Todo lo que tengo
(Todo lo que tengo)

decirte quisiera

Lyrics:
(1, 2, 3, 4) The highways jammed with broken heroes
On a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday girl, I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place
Where we really want to go, and we'll walk in the sun
But till then, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

This piece was originally released on February 27th, 1995 on album Greatest Hits. Almost two years later ""Secret Garden"" gained a lot of popularity thanks to ""Jerry Maguire"" - Cameron Crowe's sport drama. I recommend both the movie (with Tom Cruise, Renée Zellweger, Cuba Gooding jr., Jonathan Lipnicki, Ray Mohr, Kelly Preston) and great collection of songs appreciated by filmmakers (The Who, Neil Young, Elvis Presley, Paul McCartney, Nancy Wilson, Bob Dylan and others). Lyrics below.

--------------------------------------------------------------

PL: Znana i lubiana piosenka Bruce'a Springsteena, ""Secret Garden"", część swojej popularności zawdzięcza filmowi ""Jerry Maguire"". Utwór pierwotnie pojawił się w albumie Greatest Hits wydanym 27 lutego 1995 roku. Prawie dwa lata później ""Secret Garden"" stał się częścią ścieżki dźwiękowej filmu. Oba te utwory zainspirowały mnie do stworzenia własnego teledysku. Polecam zarówno świetny dramat Camerona Crowe'a, jak i znakomity soundtrack. Na płycie znajdują się utwory m.in. The Who, Elvisa Presleya, Neila Younga, Paula McCartneya, Nancy Wilson i Boba Dylana.

LYRICS (słowa):

She'll let you in her house,
If you come knockin' late at night.
She'll let you in her mind,
If the words you say are right.
If you pay the price,
She'll let you deep inside,
But there's a secret garden she hides.
She'll let you in her car,
To go drivin' 'round.
She'll let you into the parts of herself,
That'll bring you down.
She'll let you in her heart,
If you got a hammer and a vise,
But into her secret garden, don't think twice.

You've gone a million miles,
How far'd you get,
To that place where you can't remember,
And you can't forget.

She'll lead you down a path.
There'll be tenderness in the air.
She'll let you come just far enough,
So you know she's really there.
Then she'll look at you and smile,
And her eyes will say,
She's got a secret garden,
Where everything you want,
Where everything you need,
Will always stay,
A million miles away.

Lyrics

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby
Do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year
It doesn't surprise me

Happy Christmas

I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you""
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Oh, oh, baby

A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover, but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love. You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
I gave you my heart
A man under cover, but you tore him apart
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone special

Special
Someone
Someone
I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone special

Who give me something in return
I'll give it to someone—
Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone—

I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone special

I thought you were here to stay
How could you love me for a day
I thought you were someone special

Gave you my heart

I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone—

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
You gave it away

I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone—",True,True,1138490572.0,pop music

Lyrics

You put the boom-boom into my heart
You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts
Jitterbug into my brain
Goes a bang-bang-bang 'til my feet do the same
But something's bugging you
Something ain't right
My best friend told me what you did last night
Left me sleepin' in my bed
I was dreaming, but I should have been with you instead.

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high (yeah, yeah)

You take the grey skies out of my way
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day
Turned a bright spark into a flame
My beats per minute never been the same

'Cause you're my lady, I'm your fool
It makes me crazy when you act so cruel
Come on, baby, let's not fight
We'll go dancing, everything will be all right

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not plannin'' on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high (yeah, yeah, baby)

(Jitterbug)
(Jitterbug)

Cuddle up, baby, move in tight
We'll go dancing tomorrow night
It's cold out there, but it's warm in bed
They can dance, we'll stay home instead

(Jitterbug)

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
Wake me up before you go-go, don't you dare to leave me hanging on like a
yo-yo

Lyrics

Oh yeah
Work

Somebody told me
Boy, everything she wants is everything she sees
I guess I must have loved you
'Cause I said you were the perfect girl for me, baby

But now we're six months older
And everything you want and everything you see
Is out of reach, not good enough
I don't know what the hell you want from me but boy

Somebody tell me, won't you tell me
Why I work so hard for you?
Give you money
All to give you money""",True,True,81173399.0,pop music

Lyrics

Let me take you to the place
Where membership's a smiling face,
Brush shoulders with the stars.
Where strangers take you by the hand,
And welcome you to wonderland -
From beneath their panamas...

Club Tropicana, drinks are free,
Fun and sunshine - there's enough for everyone.
All that's missing is the sea,
But don't worry, you can suntan!

Castaways and Lovers meet,
Then kiss in Tropicana's heat,
Watch the waves break on the bay.
Soft white sands, a blue lagoon,
Cocktail time, a summer's tune,
A whole night's holiday!

Club Tropicana, drinks are free,
Fun and sunshine - there's enough for everyone.
All that's missing is the sea,
But don't worry, you can suntan!

Pack your bags,
And leave tonight.
Don't take your time,
Gotta move your feet, don't you miss the flight!
Cool, cool, cool, cool

Club Tropicana, drinks are free,
Fun and sunshine - there's enough for everyone.
All that's missing is the sea,
But don't worry, you can suntan!

Call me bad
Call me anything you want to baby
But I know that you're sad
And I know I'll make you happy
With the one thing that you never had

Baby, I'm your man (don't you know that?)
Baby, I'm your man
You bet!
If you're gonna do it, do it right - right?
Do it with me

Lyrics

Everyday I hear a different story
People say that you're no good for me
So you love another
And she's making a fool of you
Oh
If you love me baby
Don't deny it
But you left me
And tell me
I should try it
Tell me I'm a baby
And I will understand

But to know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause baby
You could take me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do

I don't want your freedom
I don't want to play around
I don't want nobody's baby

Lyrics
I would lock you up
But I could not bear to hear you
Screaming to be set free
I would chain you up
If I'd thought you'd swear
The only one that mattered was me, me, me
I would strap you up
But don't worry baby
You know I wouldn't hurt you 'less you wanted me to

It's too late to stop
Won't the heavens save me?
My daddy said the devil looks a lot like you

You take me to the edge of heaven
Tell me that my soul's forgiven
Hide you baby's eyes and we can...
You take me to the edge of heaven
One last time might be forever
When the passion dies -
It's just a matter of time before my heart is
Looking for a home

I'm like a maniac, at the end of the day
I'm like a doggie barking at your door
So come take me back to the place you stay
And maybe we can do it once more

You say I'm dangerous
But don't worry baby
I get excited at the things that you do
And there's a place for us in a dirty movie
'Cos no-one does it better than me and you

You take me to the edge of heaven
Tell me that my soul's forgiven
Hide your baby's eyes and we can...
You take me to the edge of heaven
One last time might be forever
Please don't tell me lies
It's just a matter of time before my heart is
Looking for a home

I ain't got no more worries
I'm gonna spend some times with you
Loving you takes such courage
And don't you think that I know it

You take me to the edge of heaven
You tell me that my soul's forgiven
Hide your baby's eyes and we can...
You take me to the edge of heaven
One last time might be forever
Don't you tell me lies, because believe me baby
One day you'll wake up on your own.

I ain't got no more worries
I ain't got no more time for you
Loving you takes such courage
Everyone's got their eyes on you
I ain't got no more worries
I ain't got no more time for you
Loving you takes such courage
And don't you think that I know it",True,True,27262626.0,pop music

Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover, but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love. You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
I gave you my heart
A man under cover, but you tore him apart
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone special

Special
Someone
Someone
I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone special

Who give me something in return
I'll give it to someone—
Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone—

I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone special

I thought you were here to stay
How could you love me for a day
I thought you were someone special

Gave you my heart

I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone—

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
You gave it away

I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone—",True,True,3597930.0,pop music

Lyrics

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away.
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special.

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away.
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special.

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye.
Tell me, baby,
Do you recognize me?
Well,
It's been a year,
It doesn't surprise me
(Merry Christmas)

I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,""
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been.
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again.

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away.
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special.

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away.
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special.

Oh, oh, baby.

A crowded room,
Friends with tired eyes.
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice.
My god I thought you were someone to rely on.
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on.

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart.
A man under cover but you tore me apart, ooh-hoo.
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again.

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away.
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special.

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away.
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special.

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone
I'll give it to someone special.

Lyrics
Hey sucker
(What the hell's got into you?)
Hey sucker
(Now there's nothing you can do)
Well I hadn't seen your face around town awhile,
So I greeted you, with a knowing smile,
When I saw that girl upon your arm,
I knew she won your heart with a fatal charm.
I said ""Soul Boy, let's hit the town!""
I said ""Soul Boy, what's with the frown?""
But in return, all you could say was
""Hi George, meet my fiancee""
Young guns,
Having some fun
Crazy ladies keep 'em on the run.
Wise guys realize there's danger in emotional ties.
See me, single and free
No tears, no fears, what I want to be.
One, two, take a look at you
Death by matrimony!
Hey sucker,
(What the hell's got into you?)
Hey sucker!
(Now there's nothing you can do.)
A married man? you're out of your head
Sleepless nights, on an H.P. bed
A daddy by the time you're twenty-one
If your happy with a nappy then you're in for fun.
But you're here
And you're there
Well there's guys like you just everywhere
Looking back on the good old days?
Well this young gun says caution pays!
Young guns,
Having some fun
Crazy ladies keep 'em on the run.
Wise guys realize there's danger in emotional ties.
See me, single and free
No tears, no fears, what I want to be.
One, two, take a look at you
Death by matrimony!
I remember when he such fun and everything was fine,
I remember when we use to have a good time,
Partners in crime.
Tell me that's all in the past and I will gladly walk away,
Tell me that you're happy now,
Turning my back
Nothing to say!
""Hey tell this jerk to take a hike,
There's somethin' 'bout that boy I don't like""
""Well sugar he don't mean the things he said""
""Just get him outta my way, 'cause I'm seeing red
We got plans to make, we got things to buy
And you're wasting time on some creepy guy""
""Hey shut up chick, that's a friend of mine,
Just watch your mouth babe, you're out of line""
Oh!
Get Back
Hands off
Go for it!
Get Back
Hands off
Go for it!
Young guns,
Having some fun
Crazy ladies keep 'em on the run.
Wise guys realize there's danger in emotional ties.
See me, single and free
No tears, no fears, what I want to be.

Letras:
No dejabas de mirar, estabas sola
Completamente bella y sensual
Algo me arrastó hacia ti como una ola
Y fui y te dije ""hola, ¿qué tal?""
Esa noche entre tus brazos, caí en la trampa
Cazaste al aprendiz de seductor
Y me diste de comer sobre tu palma
Haciéndome tu humilde servidor
Amiga
Hay que ver cómo es el amor
Que vuelve a quien lo toma
Gavilán o paloma
Pobre tonto, ingenuo charlatán
Que fui paloma por querer ser gavilán
Amiga
Hay que ver cómo es el amor
Que vuelve a quien lo toma
Gavilán o paloma
Fui bajando lentamente tu vestido
Y tú no me dejaste ni hablar
Solamente suspirabas ""te necesito""
Abrázame más fuerte, más
Al mirarte me sentí desengañado
Solo me dio frío tu calor
Lentamente, te solté de entre mis brazos
Y dije ""estate quieta, por favor""
Amiga
Hay que ver cómo es el amor
Que vuelve a quien lo toma
Gavilán o paloma
Pobre tonto, ingenuo charlatán
Que fui paloma por querer ser gavilán
Amiga
Hay que ver cómo es el amor
Que vuelve a quien lo toma
Gavilán o paloma
Pobre tonto, ingenuo charlatán
Que fui paloma por querer ser gavilán

The performance of the song was so impressive that caused tears, standing ovations, expressions of amazement and cheers from Angélica María, Alberto Vázquez, Marco Antonio Muñiz, the judges and the spectators in the Teatro Ferrocarrilero in Mexico City.

This trio of songwriters, went on to have 3 number one records during the 1990's.  Sadly Kamen died of multiple sclerosis in 2003, Adams says ""Losing Michael was like losing a brother, and I think of him every time I sing this song."" 
This video was filmed in Miami, Florida 1992 and directed by Andy Morahan. 

Lyric:

Look into my eyes - you will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart - search your soul
And when you find me there you'll search no more
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

Look into my heart - you will FIND
There's nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am - take my life
I would give it ALL I would sacrifice
Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it there's nothin' I want more
Ya know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

There's no love - like your love
And no other - could give more love
There's nowhere - unless you're there
All the time - all the way

Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
I can't help it there's nothin' I want more
I would fight for you - I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you - Ya I'd die for you

Ya know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

To really love a woman
To understand her - you gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought - see every dream
N' give her wings when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
Ya know ya really love a woman
 
When you love a woman you tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
Cuz she needs somebody to tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really - really really ever loved....
 
To really love a woman
Let her hold you - til ya know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her
Til you can feel her in your blood
N' when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
Ya know ya really love a woman

When you love a woman you tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
Cuz she needs somebody to tell her that you’ll always be together
So tell me have you ever really - really really ever loved....
 
You got to give her some faith - hold her tight
A little tenderness - gotta treat her right
She will be there for you, takin' good care of you
Ya you really gotta love your woman...

The dog in the video belonged to the studio owner, but liked BA and followed him during his stay there. Mutt and BA also wrote ""All For Love"" around the same time as this song.

Lyrics:

It still feels like our first night together
Feels like the first kiss and it's gettin' better...
No one can better this
I’m still holdin' on and you're still the one
The first time our eyes met - it's the same feelin...
Only feels much stronger - i wanna love ya longer
You still turn the fire on...

So if you're feelin' lonely..don't 
You're the only one i'd ever want
I only wanna make it good 
So if i love ya - a little more than i should

Please forgive me - I know not what I do
Please forgive me - I can't stop loving you
Don't deny me - this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me - if I need you like I do
Please believe me - every word I say is true
Please forgive me - I can't stop loving you

Still feels like our best times are together
Feels like the first touch - we’re still getting closer baby
Can't get close enough
Still holding on - you're still number one
I remember the smell of your skin
I remember everything - I remember all your moves
I remember you - yeah
I remember the nights, you know I still do

Chorus

The one thing I'm sure of - is the way we make love
The one thing I depend on - is for us to stay strong
With every word and every breath I'm praying
That's why I'm saying…

Straight From The Heart

I could start dreamin' but it never ends
As long as you're gone we may as well pretend
I've been dreamin' - straight from the heart

You say it's easy but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier - comin' straight from the heart

Oh, give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go - as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart

I’ll see you on the street some other time
And all my words would just fall out of line
While we're dreamin' - straight from the heart

We waited all through the year
For the day to appear
When we could be together in harmony

You know the time will come 
Peace on earth for everyone
And we can live forever in a world where we are free
Let it shine for you and me

There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday
To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away

We're all as one tonight
Makes no difference if you're black or white
'cause we can sing together in harmony

I know it's not too late
The world would be a better place
If we can keep the spirit more than one day in the year
Send a message loud and clear

It's the time of year when everyone's together
We'll celebrate here on Christmas day
When the ones you love are there
You can feel the magic in the air
You know it's everywhere


There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday
To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away
Please tell me Christmas will never go away

IT'S ONLY LOVE

When the feelin' is ended
There ain't no use pretendin'
Don't ya worry it's only love

When your world has been shattered
Ain't nothin' else matters
It ain't over it's only love
And that's all ya

When your heart has been broken
Hard words have been spoken
It ain't easy but it's only love

And if your life ain't worth livin'
And you're ready to give in
Just remember that it's only love

You can live without the aggravation
Ya gotta wanna win ya gotta wanna win
You keep lookin' back in desperation
Over and over and over again

When your world is shattered
Ain't nothin' else matters
It ain't over it's only love
If your life ain't worth livin'
And you're ready to give in
Just remember that it's only love
Yeah, that's all
Yeah it ain't easy baby
But it's only love and that's all

#DeanMartin #EverybodyLovesSomebody #GoldenStars

Lyrics:
Everybody loves somebody sometime
Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
My sometime is now

Everybody finds somebody someplace
There's no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying
My someplace is here

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charms
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dreams were overdue
Your love made well worth waiting
For someone like you

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charms
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dreams were overdue
Your love made well worth waiting
For someone like you",True,True,103680932.0,traditional pop

When the snow comes to cover the ground)
It's time for play it's a whipped cream day
I wait for it the whole year around

In the arms of the ever-green-trees)
And the sun is red like a pumpkin had
It's shining so your nose won't freeze

Lyrics:

Tengo en una libreta tantas canciones
Tiene tu nombre, y tengo razones
Para buscarte y volverte a hablar
 
Dice en esa libreta sin más razones
La hora y la fecha y dos corazones
Y dice Calle San Sebastián
 
Y si tengo que escoger
Me quedo, me quedo contigo
Y si yo vuelvo a San Juan
Yo bailo, yo bailo contigo
 
Y si te tengo que olvidar
Tú sabes que no va a pasar
Y si te vuelvo a ver
Me quedo, me quedo, me quedo, me quedo, me quedo contigo
 
Contigo desde Alaska a Buenos Aires
Contigo desde Londres hasta Nueva York
Maldito castigo le grito al aire
Si yo sé que contigo siempre estoy mejor
 
Tengo en mi libreta esa canción boricua
Esa que escribí pensando en tu boquita
Y yo quiero bailarla bien apretaita
Carita con carita cosita rica
 
Tengo en mi libreta esa canción bonita
La que siempre, siempre, fue tu favorita
La que siempre, siempre, mueve tu boquita…
 
Y si tengo que escoger
Me quedo me quedo contigo
Y si yo vuelvo a San Juan
Yo bailo, yo bailo contigo
 
Y si te tengo que olvidar
Tú sabes que no va a pasar
Y si te vuelvo a ver
Me quedo, me quedo, me quedo, me quedo, me quedo contigo
 
Guardo en una libreta de direcciones
Tu nombre escrito y unas canciones
Y siento ganas de irte a buscar
 
Dice en esa libreta sin más razones
La hora y la fecha y dos corazones
Y dice Calle San Sebastián
 
Y si tengo que escoger
Me quedo, me quedo contigo
Y si yo vuelvo a San Juan
Yo bailo, yo bailo contigo
 
Y si te tengo que olvidar
Tú sabes que no va a pasar
Y si te vuelvo a ver
 
Me quedo, me quedo, me quedo, me quedo, me quedo contigo
 
Me quedo, me quedo, me quedo contigo
 
Tengo en mi libreta esa cancián boricua
Esa que escribí pensando en tu boquita
Y yo quiero bailarla bien apretaita
 
Me quedo, me quedo, me quedo contigo
 
Tengo en mi libreta esa canción bonita
La que siempre, siempre, fue tu favorita
La que siempre, siempre, mueve tu boquita
 
Me quedo, me quedo, me quedo contigo

Letras:

Algo me dice que ya no volveras 
Estoy seguro que esta vez No habra marcha atras

Despues de todo fui yo a decirte que no 
Sabes bien que no es cierto 
Estoy muriendo por dentro

Y ahora es que me doy cuenta 
Que sin ti no soy nada 
He perdido las fuerzas 
He perdido las ganas

He intentado encontrarte
En otras personas 
No es igual 
No es lo mismo 
Nos separa un abismo

Vuelve Que sin ti la vida se me va 
Oh, vuelve Que me falta el aire si tu no estas
Oh, vuelve Nadie ocupara tu lucar

Sobra tanto espacio Si no estas 
No paso un minuto sin pensar 
Sin ti la vida lentamente se me va

Algo me dice Ya no sirve de nada 
Tantas noches en vela 
Aferrado a mi almohada

Si pudiera tan solo regresar un momento 
Ahora es que te comprendo 
Ahora es cuando te pierdo

Vuelve Que sin ti la vida se me va...

Y a pesar que fui yo 
A decirte que no 
Sin embargo aqui sigo insistiendote

Vuelve Que sin ti la vida se me va...""",True,True,129284609.0,Latin pop

Letras:

Tu recuerdo sigue aqui, como un aguacero
Rompe fuerte sobre mi, pero a fuego lento
Quema y moja por igual, y ya no se lo que pensar
Si tu recuerdo me hace bien o me hace mal
Un beso gris, un beso blanco
Todo depende del lugar
Que yo me fui, eso esta claro
Pero tu recuerdo no se va
Siento tus labios en las noches de verano
Ahi estan, cuidandome en mi soledad
Pero a veces me quieren matar
Tu recuerdo sigue aqui
A veces gris, a veces blanco
Todo depende del lugar
Que tu te fuiste, eso es pasado
Se que te tengo que olvidar
Pero yo le puse una velita a to's mis santos
Ahi esta, pa' que pienses mucho en mi
No dejes de pensar en mi
Tu recuerdo sigue aqui
(piensa en mi) es antidoto y veneno al corazon
(te hace bien) que quema y moja, que viene y va
(tu donde estas?) atrapado entre los versos y el adios
Tu recuerdo sigue aqui
Como aguacero de mayo
Rompe fuerte sobre mi
Y cae tan fuerte que hasta me quema hasta la piel
Quema y moja por igual
Y ya no se lo que pensar
Si tu recuerdo me hace bien o me hace mal
Tu recuerdo sigue aqui
Le lo lay lelo lelo
Rompe fuerte sobre mi
Pero que rompe, rompe, el corazon

Van diez noches sin hablar  
Ya no aguanto esta ciudad  
Sin tú no estás 
  
Por más que intenté escapar  
Regresé al mismo lugar Y tú, no estás 
  
De tantas cosas me arrepiento  
Me haces falta, no te miento 
Que fácil fue quererte  
Y que difícil olvidarte 
  
Cómo te va  
Con quién estás 
Si alguien pregunta  
Vivo aquí esperando regresar  
 
A veces bien y a veces mal 
No se si a ti también te pasa igual  
 
Le faltan piezas al rompecabezas  
Ha sido duro mi amor  
Como pesan las fotos  
Que siguen adornando mi mesa 
  
Ay como duele  
Ay como duele cuando un hombre pierde lo quiere  
Dime por favor 
Que nuestro amor no murió  
Que fácil fue quererte 
 
Y que no daría por verte una vez más 
  
Cómo te va 
Con quién estás 
Si alguien pregunta 
Vivo aquí esperando regresar  
  
A veces bien y a veces mal 
No se si a ti también te pase igual  
No se si a ti también te pase igual 
 
Van diez noches sin hablar 
A veces bien y a veces mal

Letras:

Traigo en los bolsillos tanta soledad 
desde que te fuiste no me queda mas 
que una foto gris y un triste sentimiento 
Lo que mas lastima es tanta confusion 
en cada resquicio de mi corazon 
como hacerte a un lado 
de mis pensamientos 
Por ti, por ti, por ti 
he dejado todo sin mirar atras 
aposte la vida y me deje ganar 
Te extraño 
porque vive en mi tu recuerdo 
te olvido 
a cada minuto lo intento 
te amo 
es que ya no tengo remedio 
te extraño, te olvido 
y te amo de nuevo...( se repite) 
He perdido todo, hasta la identidad 
y si lo pidieras mas podria dar 
es que cuando se ama, 
nada es demasiado 
Me enseñaste el limite da la pasion 
y no me enseñaste a decir adios 
he aprendido ahora 
que te has marchado 
Por ti, por ti, por ti... 
Te extraño...

Lyrics:
Buenos días
Lo reconozco hace mucho tiempo no te escribía 
Quizás por pena tal vez orgullo o cobardía
Pero hoy me levante pensando en ti (pensando en ti)

Buenos días
Te escribo esto mientras el desayuno se enfría 
Cuéntame todo que tanto has hecho que hay de tu vida 
Es que me levante pensando en ti (pensando en ti)

Hoy salí en el viejo Mustang
Que tanto te gusta
Ventanas abajo
Me ha costado trabajo estar sin ti 
Yo te espero aquí
Otra noche en L.A.

Y aunque esta vida me gusta 
Sin ti es algo injusta
Ganas no me faltan de llegar 
La vida loca se va y sigo aquí 
Esperando por ti
Otra noche en L.A.

Otra noche en Los Ángeles 
De aquí no salgo
En tu chat esperando
Que tú me escribas algo 
Esta vida es buena
No lo niego, sin embargo
De que tú no estés conmigo con la culpa cargo 
Vuelve
Que el café se me enfría
Perdona lo infantil
Fueron tiempos de rebeldía
Ayer miré tu foto y yo con el corazón roto
Por qué en la foto debo estar yo suponía 

Jingle bells
Cuando te vuelva a ver
Si vienes a mis cumpleaños
Te guardo pastel
Si pasas por la Melrose
Me verás con un cartel
Que te dice vuelve a casa
Yo no soy aquel
Que te dejaba la cena servida
Por el contrario, yo te hago la comida 
Quise hacer algo diferente hoy 
Guardé la Rolls Royce 

Hoy salí en el viejo Mustang
Que tanto te gusta
Ventanas abajo
Me ha costado trabajo estar sin ti 
Yo te espero aquí
Otra noche en L.A. (Otra noche en L.A.)

Y aunque esta vida me gusta 
Sin ti es algo injusta
Ganas no me faltan de llegar 
La vida loca se va y sigo aquí 
Esperando por ti
Otra noche en L.A. (Otra noche en L.A.)

Lyrics:

Let's get loud, let's get loud 
Turn the music up, let's do it 
C'mon people let's get loud 
Let's get loud 
Turn the music up to hear that sound 
Let's get loud, let's get loud 
Ain't nobody gotta tell ya 
What you gotta do 

If you wanna live your life 
Live it all the way and don't you waste it 
Every feelin' every beat 
Can be so very sweet you gotta taste it 
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way 
You gotta prove it 
You gotta mean what you say 
Life's a party, make it hot 
Dance don't ever stop, whatever rhythm 
Every minute, every day 
Take them all the way you gotta live 'em ('cause I'm going to live my life)
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way 
You gotta prove it 
You gotta mean what you say 
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way 
You gotta prove it 
You gotta mean what you say 

Let's get loud, let's get loud 
Turn the music up to hear that sound 
Let's get loud, let's get loud 
Ain't nobody gotta tell you 
What you gotta do

Lyrics:

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rolley bling

Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But your hard to miss think you outta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

All that matter's is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Lyrics:

Shimmy Shimmy yah, Shimmer yam
Shimmer yay
I'm a ol' dirty dog all day
No way Jose
Your girl only go one way, ay mi madre
You should check that out
Maybe you ain't turn her out
Maybe it's none of my business
But for now work it out
Let's get this, dale

Nobody knows what I'm feeling inside
I find it so stupid
So why should I hide
That I love to make love to you baby
(yeah make love to me)
So many ways wanna touch you tonight
I'm a big girl got no secrets this time
Yeah I love to make love to you baby
(yeah make love to me)

If this would be a perfect world
We'd be together then
(let's do it do it do it)
Only got just one life this I've learned
Who cares what they're gonna say
(let's do it do it do it)

I wanna dance, and love, and dance again
I wanna dance, and love, and dance again

Dance, yes
Love, next
Dance, yes
Love, next

Baby your fire is lighting me up
The way that you move boy is reason enough
That I love to make love to you baby
(yeah make love to me)
I can't behave
Oh I want you so much
Your lips taste like heaven
So why should I stop?
Yeah I love to make love to you baby
(yeah make love to me)""

Lyrics:

I met so many men and
It's like their all the same
My appetite for lovin'
Is now my hunger pain

And when I'm feelin' sexy
Who's gonna comfort me
My only problem is
Their insecurity

(Tired of bein' alone) Yeah, yeah
(Sick of arguin on the phone) Yeah, yeah
(Are you tellin' all your friends) Yeah, yeah
(That your n***a don't understand) My love

Cause I'm real
(The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk)
Cause I'm real
(The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair)
Cause I'm real
(The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild)
Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

Girl, I've been thinkin' bout this relationship
And I wanna know is this as good as it gets
Cause we've been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time, even if it was part-time
Now they've been lookin' at me, smilin' at me, laughin' like we wasn't happy
But not knowin', ever growin' and we're gettin' married
Hard lovin' and straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doin' this s**t for nuttin'
I'm here to get it poppin', hoppin, let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind, sun glistenin' off my skin, hey
I'm nasty, heh, you know me
But you still don't f**k with your baby

Lyrics:

Ya lookin' just a little too hard at me
Standin' just a little too close to me
Ya sayin not quite enough to me
Ya sippin' just a little too slow for me
No doubt ya playin' real cool homie
Got me thinkin' what is it you do for me
Trippin' (trippin') a little more than I should be
So let ya self go and get right with me

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get
get riiiiiiiight get riiiiiiight, we can get right
I'm about to fill your cup, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get riiiiiiight toniiiiiiight, we can get right
Do you want more? [4x]

Ya lips talkin' bout I play too much
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants
My hips movin' oh so slow
Bar tab lookin like a car note
All I need is you here right by my side
Take whatever ya want, baby let's ride
And whatever ya won't do let me decide.
Just put ya name on the dotted line

""SCHLECHTES VORBILD""-LYRICS:

[Strophe I]
Scheiß egal eh..
Das Gesetz bedeutet nichts für mich
Ich geb schon immer nen Fick drauf was richtig ist
Ich hab 'ne große Fresse auch wenn du ein Grizzly bist
Mein Freund ich bin wie ich bin weil es ist wie's ist
Ich hab 'ne Abneigung gegen Lehrer und 'ne Sechs in Mathe
Ich hab's ihm einfach weggenommen wenn er was besseres hatte
Ich behalt alles für mich, ich geb nie ab
Ich scheiß' auf Mitleid und Gefühle ich geb 'n Fick
Ich bin unberechenbar, ich lass nicht mir mir reden
Ich hab kein Problem damit die Kasse mitzunehmen
Und dir 'nen Tritt zu geben wenn du mich stresst du Penner
Denn wir hier bei der Sekte regeln das wie echte Männer
Homeboy ich kann es seh'n du würdest gerne sein wie ich
Du würdest alles tun für ein Leben aus meiner Sicht
Denn deins ist langweilig, du bist brav wie immer
Und ich geh ab los mach's mir nach du Spinner

[Hook]
Ich bin all das wovor deine Eltern dich immer gewarnt haben
Doch ich hab Geld, hab Frauen, hab Spaß und du musst immer noch Bahn fahren
Ich bin ein schlechtes Vorbild
Na und wer sagt was schlecht ist?
Ich passe nicht in dein Konzept,
Egal mir geht es prächtig,
Pass doch auf, hör mir zu, mach's mir nach
(Mach's mir nach du Spinner!)
Ich bleib so wie ich bin egal was ihr sagt

[Strophe II]
Mein Körper ist eine Ruine, denn ich nehm viele Drogen
Immer wenn ich high bin mutiere ich zum Philosophen
Die Welt ist klein, denn ich betrachte sie von oben
Ich bin unerzogen, abgehoben, haut ab ihr Idioten
Ich trinke wie ein Loch doch das ist meine Sache
Warum ist das ein Problem? Weil ich's nicht heimlich mache
Ich bin immer ehrlich und ja ich bin gefährlich
Ich nehm den Laden auseinander und tu so als wär nix
Ich hab kein Respekt, ich bin zu keinem nett
Und wenn dein neues Handy weg ist, hab ich's eingesteckt
Ich bin ein Rüpel, ein Raudi und ich kann Nerven sägen
Gib mir 'ne Glotze und 'nen Joint, ich brauch nicht mehr zum leben
Man sucht mein Herz vergebens, ich kann keinem trauen
Das ist der Ernst des Lebens, erstmal einen bauen
Ich schwing an der Lampe durchs Zimmer wie Tarzan
Ich bin der vor dem sie dich immer gewarnt haben

[Hook]
Ich bin all das wovor deine Eltern dich immer gewarnt haben
Doch ich hab Geld, hab Frauen, hab Spaß und du musst immer noch Bahn fahren
Ich bin ein schlechtes Vorbild
Na und wer sagt was schlecht ist?
Ich passe nicht in dein Konzept,
Egal mir geht es prächtig,
Pass doch auf, hör mir zu, mach's mir nach
(Mach's mir nach du Spinner!)
Ich bleib so wie ich bin egal was ihr sagt

[Strophe III]
Wenn euer Kind versucht wie ich zu sein, dann lasst es machen
Man lernt nicht, dass Feuer heiß ist ohne es mal anzufassen
Woher wollt ihr wissen was gut ist, wenn nichts schlecht ist?
Wenn nichts schön ist, bin ich auch nicht hässlich
Seid doch ehrlich, ihr wart doch auch mal jung
Und habt gekifft oder woher kommen die Raucherlungen
Tut nicht so als wenn ihr Engel wart ihr habt Leichen im Keller
Wie jeder andere, also seid leise ihr Penner
Vertraut euer'm Kind, ihr werdet nicht enttäuscht
Meine Mutter hat das auch geschafft und sie hat es nicht bereut
Du musst einfach das Kind in dir rauslassen
Bis deine Kinder auf ihre Kinder aufpassen

[Hook]
Ich bin all das wovor deine Eltern dich immer gewarnt haben
Doch ich hab Geld, hab Frauen, hab Spaß und du musst immer noch Bahn fahren
Ich bin ein schlechtes Vorbild
Na und wer sagt was schlecht ist?
Ich passe nicht in dein Konzept,
Egal mir geht es prächtig,
Pass doch auf, hör mir zu, mach's mir nach
(Mach's mir nach du Spinner!)
Ich bleib so wie ich bin egal was ihr sagt",True,True,100222618.0,Not Found

It was supposedly completed October 5, a mere two days after the completion of his Symphony No. 24, although this remains unsubstantiated. Its first movement is widely known as the opening music in Miloš Forman's film Amadeus. The symphony is laid out in standard classical form:
1. Allegro con brio, 4/4 in G minor
2. Andante, 2/4 in E-flat major
3. Menuetto & Trio, 3/4 in G minor, Trio in G major
4. Allegro, 4/4 in G minor.
With its wide-leap melodic lines and brisk musical subjects, this symphony is characteristic of the Sturm und Drang style. It shares certain features with other Sturm und Drang symphonies of this time, and is likely inspired from Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 39 which is likewise in G minor. The opening Mannheim rocket (a rising arpeggiated sequence) was quoted by Beethoven in his first Piano Sonata as the principal subject of the first movement.

Piano Sonata No. 16 in C major (""Sonata semplice"") K. 545. Vienna, June 26,1788

1. Allegro (0:00)
2. Andante (3:27)
3. Rondo. Allegretto (8:15)

Ingrid Haebler, piano

Description by Brian Robins  [-]
Universally known as the ""Sonata facile (or semplice),"" the relative ease of K. 545 has ensured that it has become the most of famous of all Mozart's piano sonatas, a work that scarcely a student of the instrument fails to learn at some point in his or her career. The entry in Mozart's own thematic catalog, dated June 26, 1788, adds that the sonata was intended ""for beginners."" Yet despite its fame today, the circumstances of its composition are not known, the original manuscript is lost, and the sonata was not published in Mozart's lifetime, the first edition appearing in 1805 from the press of the composer and publisher Johann André of Offenbach.

There are three short movements: an Allegro, often quoted as a paradigm of the ambiguity of Classical ""simplicity,"" a charming central Andante, and a tiny finale in Rondo form. It is remarkable to note that this unpretentious little work must have been composed at the same time as the great last trilogy of symphonies; indeed it was added by Mozart to his catalog of works on the same day as the first of those magnificent works, the great Symphony No. 39 in E flat, K. 543, one of his grandest conceptions.",False,False,33729624.0,Classical period

Adagio for violin & orchestra in E major, K. 261 (1776)
Cadence: Arthur Grumiaux

Arthur Grumiaux, violin and the New Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Raymond Leppard
Rec. April 1967

Description by Brian Robins  [-]
Mozart's works for violin and orchestra were largely composed in Salzburg between 1773 and 1776. It is not known whether they were written for Mozart, a fine violinist himself, or a member of the Salzburg court orchestra. The oft-repeated assertion that they were composed for the Italian violinist Antonio Brunetti, the leader of the Salzburg orchestra, has been challenged on the grounds that Brunetti was not appointed leader until 1776, the year following the completion of the concertos. However, Brunetti is known to have performed them after taking the post, and the present Adagio is almost certainly that referred to by Leopold Mozart in a letter to his son as ""the Adagio you wrote specially for Brunetti."" Key relationships make it likely that the movement was intended as a substitute for the slow middle movement of the Violin Concerto No. 5 in A, K. 219, which according to Leopold had been found ""too artificial"" by Brunetti. Dating from 1776, the serenity of the movement is enhanced by orchestral accompaniment scored for muted strings, with a pair of flutes replacing the oboes employed in the outer movements.

Letra de «Hasta Que Te Conocí»

No sabía de tristezas
Ni de lágrimas, ni nada
Que me hicieran llorar
Yo sabía de caricias
De ternura porque a mí desde pequeño
Eso me enseñó mamá

Eso me enseñó mamá
Eso y muchas cosas más

Yo jamás sufrí
Yo jamás lloré
Yo era muy feliz
Yo vivía
Yo vivía muy bien

(Hey, hey)

Yo vivía tan distinto
Algo hermoso, algo divino
Lleno de felicidad
Yo sabía de alegrías
La belleza de la vida
Pero no de soledad
Pero no de soledad
De eso y muchas cosas más
Yo jamás sufrí
Yo jamás lloré
Yo era y muy feliz
Yo vivía
Yo vivía muy bien

Hasta que
Hasta que te conocí
Vi la vida con dolor
No te miento fui feliz
Aunque con muy poco amor
Y muy tarde comprendí
Que no debería amar jamás
Porque ahora pienso en ti
Mucho más que ayer
Pero mucho más

(No me provoquen)

Hasta que te conocí
Comencé a vivir la vida con dolor
No te miento fui feliz
Aunque con muy poco amor
Y muy tarde comprendí
Que no debería amar
Porque ahora pienso en ti
Porque ahora pienso en ti
Y porque ahora pienso en ti
Mucho más que ayer
Pero mucho más

Yo jamás sufrí
Pero desgraciadamente
Era una noche como ésta
Cuando te encontré

(¡Ah!)
(¡Eh!)
(¡Eh!)
(¡Ah!)
Reflectores abajo

¡Wu!
Ay
Ay
Eh, eh
Oh, oh
Ajá
Oh

Y ahora quiero que me digas
Si valió o no la pena
¡Ay! haberte conocido
Porque no te quiero ver
Y es que tú fuiste mala
Sí, muy mala conmigo
¡Ay! por eso no te quiero
No te quiero ver jamás

Y ahora quiero que me digas
Si valió o no la pena
¡Ay! haberte conocido
Porque no te quiero ver
Y es que tú fuiste mala
Sí, muy mala conmigo
¡Ay! Por eso no te quiero
No te quiero ver jamás

No te quiero, no
No te quiero, no
No te quiero, no
No te quiero, no

No, no, no

No te quiero, no
No te quiero, no
No te quiero, y no te quiero, y no te quiero, no
No te quiero, y no te quiero, y no te quiero
Y no te quiero, y no te quiero ver
(No te quiero, y no te quiero, y no te quiero ver)

Que no te quiero, y no te quiero, y no te quiero ver
(No te quiero, y no te quiero, y no te quiero ver)

Letra de «Ya Lo Sé Que Tú Te Vas»

Hoy me he despertado
Con mucha tristeza
Sabiendo que mañana
Ya te vas de mí

Te juro mi vida
Que pensando en lo nuestro
Me pasé la noche
Casi sin dormir

Ya lo sé que tú te vas
Que quizás no volverás
Que muy tristes hoy serán
Mis mañanas si te vas

Hasta cuando volverás
A mis brazos, no lo sé
Será una eternidad
Creo que te voy a perder

Ya lo sé mi amor
Que te vas, te vas
Que ha llegado la hora
De decirnos adiós

Te deseo buena suerte
Hasta nunca, mi amor
Adiós, amor
Adiós, amor

Adiós, amor
Adiós, amor
Adiós, amor
Adiós, amor
Adiós, amor
Adiós, amor
Adiós, amor

Letra de «Te Lo Pido Por Favor»

Donde esté hoy y siempre
Yo te quiero conmigo, necesito cuidados
Necesito de ti

Si me voy, donde vaya, yo te llevo conmigo
No me dejes ir, sólo necesito de ti

Tú me sabes bien cuidar
Tú me sabes bien guiar
Todo lo haces muy bien tú
Ser muy buena es tu virtud
Cómo te puedo pagar
Todo lo que haces por mí
Todo lo feliz que soy
Todo este grande amor
Solamente con mi vida
Ten mi vida, te la doy
Pero no me dejes nunca, nunca, nunca
Te lo pido por favor

Tú me sabes bien guiar
Tú me sabes bien cuidar
Todo lo haces muy bien tú
Ser muy buena es tu virtud
Cómo te puedo pagar
Todo lo que haces por mí
Todo lo feliz que soy
Todo este inmenso amor
Solamente con mi vida
Ten mi vida, te la doy
Pero no me dejes nunca, nunca, nunca
Te lo pido por favor

Pero no me dejes nunca, nunca, nunca
Te lo pido por favor

Vincent van Gogh painted The Starry Night one year before dying.
Chopin composed his popular Nocturne when he was about twenty.
it does not matter if you think that it is too late for you or that you still have a lot of time...you have to decide whether you are Chopin or van Gogh.

The idea behind these videos is coming from a research published by the Psychology Department of Berkeley University studying the relation between colors, emotions and how external stimuli are impacting decision making. 

The study results demonstrate a strong correlation between faster music in minor tone and the choice from participants of colors from that were saturated, yellower and lighter whereas a slower and minor music produced the opposite pattern (choice of desaturated, darker and bluer colors).

Based on these findings, we wanted to create synesthesia in our videos and trigger more intense and long-lasting emotions in our viewers, get higher audience retention and interaction. We decided to do that by associating drawings from the major painters that were following the scientific findings of this research. 
The choice of these paintings and the consecutive association with the music is also based on an accurate work that requires significant time and energy.

The analysis of the melodies returned to us a lot of information on how the painting should have been made. We needed a simple blue pattern but with an intrinsic meaning. Something that people could watch for a while without really understand it.

By creating this video I tried to do only one thing which turned to be the most difficult one: make you feel an emotional synesthesia. 
When hearing the melody, don't you feel that everything is...blue? aren’t you lost in the sky? is your mind going over? It’s not for no reason.
it is not only an image, it is not only a melody. It is a trip. 
You don't feel bored. Its your mind using the notes and the colors to create your own experience.

Most of the videos online with only one image are only music, but not this. 

The research behind the perfect combination is the key for the unconscious.

The Nocturnes, Op. 9 are a set of three nocturnes written by Frédéric Chopin between 1830 and 1832 and dedicated to Madame Camille Pleyel. The work was published in 1833.
This nocturne has a rhythmic freedom that came to characterise Chopin's later work. The left hand has an unbroken sequence of quavers in simple arpeggios throughout the entire piece, while the right hand moves with freedom in patterns of eleven, twenty, and twenty-two notes.
The opening section moves into a contrasting middle section, which flows back to the opening material in a transitional passage where the melody floats above seventeen consecutive bars of D-flat major chords.

Watch Daniil Trifonov perform Chopin Prelude No. 4 in E minor from his album ""The Carnegie Recital"", released on Deutsche Grammophon.Trifonov's Carnegie Hall recital debut is bound to be a landmark event. In the past thirty years, Deutsche Grammophon has bestowed the honour of a live Carnegie Hall recording on only two other pianists: Mikhail Pletnev and Lang Lang. Recorded in February this year, this richly contrasted and spectacularly virtuosic programme includes much-loved classics by Chopin and Liszt. Trifonov was described by The Washington Post as ""an heir to Liszt""- the dynamic young Russian has been hailed around the world for his breathtaking virtuosity and the intense, inspired originality of his musical interpretations.

Lyrics:
 
There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
 
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever
 
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made
 
But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now
 
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby Baby
 
If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back
 
There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper
 
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever
 
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then
 
But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now
 
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, Baby, Baby
 
When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
 
If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now
 
(It's all coming back to me now)
And when you kiss me like this
(It's all coming back to me now)
And when I touch you like that
(It's all coming back to me now)
If you do it like this (It's all coming back to me now)
And if we...

Lyrics:

The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes
I hold on to your whole body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you
Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'm gonna do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The power of love
The power of love
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love
The power of love
I hold on to your whole body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you
Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something

Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

And you are my man

Lyrics:

So this is Christmas
And what have you done
Another year over
A new one just begun
And so this is Christmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let’s hope it’s a good one
Without any fear

And so this is Christmas
For weak and for strong
The rich and the poor ones
The war is so long
And so happy Christmas
For black and for white
For yellow and red ones
Let’s stop all the fight 

A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let’s hope it’s a good one
Without any fear 

And so this is Christmas
And what have we done
Another year over
A new one just begun
And so happy Christmas
We hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let’s hope it’s a good one

Lyrics:

Mmmm, mmmm
I get wings to fly
Oh, oh....I'm alive....Yeah

When you call on me
When I hear you breathe
I get wings to fly
I feel that I'm alive

When you look at me
I can touch the sky
I know that I'm alive

When you bless the day
I just drift away
All my worries die
I'm glad that I'm alive

You've set my heart on fire
Filled me with love
Made me a woman on clouds above
(Yeah)
I couldn't get much higher
My spirit takes flight
'Cause I am alive, oh

(When you call on me)
When you call on me
(When I hear you breathe)
When I hear you breathe
I get wings to fly
I feel that I'm alive
I'm alive

(When you reach for me)
When you reach for me
(Raising spirits high)
God knows that
That I'll be the one
Standing by through good and through trying times
And it's only begun
I can't wait for the rest of my life

(When you call on me)
When you call on me
(When you reach for me)
When you reach for me
(I get wings to fly)
I feel that I'm alive

(When you bless the day)
When you bless the day
(I just drift away)
I just drift away
All my worries die
I know that I'm alive

I get wings to fly
God knows that I'm alive

Lyrics:
 
When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
Livin’ alone
I think of all the friends I’ve known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody’s home
 
All by myself
Don’t wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
 
Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And loves so distant and obscure
Remains the cure
 
All by myself
Don’t wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don’t wanna live
All by myself
Anymore
 
When I was young
I never needed anyone
Making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
 
All by myself
Don’t wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don’t wanna live
Oh
Don’t wanna live
By myself, by myself
Anymore
By myself
Anymore
Oh
All by myself
Don’t wanna live
I never, never, never
Needed anyone

Lyrics:

I can read your mind and I know your story
I see what you're going through, yeah
It's an uphill climb, and I'm feeling sorry
But I know it will come to you, yeah

Don't surrender 'cause you can win
In this thing called love

When you want it the most, there's no easy way out
When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is

When you question me for a simple answer
I don't know what to say, no
But it's plain to see, if you stick together
You're gonna find a way, yeah

Don't surrender 'cause you can win
In this thing called love

When you want it the most, there's no easy way out
When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is
That's the way it is

When life is empty with no tomorrow
And loneliness starts to call (loneliness starts)
Baby, don't worry, forget your sorrow
'Cause love's gonna conquer it all, all

When you want it the most, there's no easy way out
When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith (don't give up on your faith)
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is
When you want it the most, there's no easy way out
When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith (don't give up your faith)
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is

That's the way it is (that's the way it is)
That's the way it is, babe
That's the way it is
Don't give up on your faith (don't give up on your faith)
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is

The spark that makes the power grow
And I will stand for my dream if I can
Symbol of my faith in who I am
But you are my only
And I must follow on the road that lies ahead
And I won't let my heart control my head
But you are my only
We don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
And I know what I've got to be
Immortality
I make my journey through eternity
I keep the memory of you and me inside
Fulfill your destiny
Is there within' the child
My storm will never end
My fate is on the wind
The king of hearts
The joker's wild

We don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
I'll make them all remember me
'Cause I have found a dream that must come true
Every ounce of me must see it through
But you are my only
I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play
Hand over my heart I'll find my way
I will make them give to me
Immortality, oh, baby
There is a vision and a fire in me
I keep the memory of you and me inside
We don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
With all my love for you
And what else we may do
We don't say goodbye

Words Lyrics:
I got the words 
I love you
Sitting on the tip of my tongue 

at your house again
are we more than friends 
there’s so much that I wanna say
but I gotta hold it back
so scared how you’ll react 
I just hide it all away 

i could give you it all 
in a minute could fall
any minute but we go round and round 
i don’t wanna mention commitment but I 
feel it slippin so please 
don’t let me down
me down 

I got the words 
I love you
Sitting on the tip of my tongue 

oh I feel like 
as soon as they leave my mouth
you’re just gonna get up and run
you’re gonna run away

you know we connect
more than just the sex 
but are you gonna let me in

I could set your world on fire 
but you’re holding the lighter
instead you’re putting out our flame

I could give you it all 
in a minute could fall
any minute but we go round and round 
I don’t wanna mention commitment but I 
feel it slippin so please 
don’t let me down


I got the words 
I love you
Sitting on the tip of my tongue 

oh I feel like 
as soon as they leave my mouth
you’re just gonna get up and run
you’re gonna run away

run away 
run away  

I got the words 
I love you
Sitting on the tip of my tongue 

oh I feel like 
as soon as they leave my mouth
you’re just gonna get up and run
you’re gonna run away

if I say it now
then one day i’ll wake up and you’ve walked out 

so i’ll just stay here with 
the words I love you
sitting on the tip of my tongue

Lyrics
I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you'll never know

When the daylight comes you feel so cold,
You know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

Waiting for the fire to light
Feeling like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control

We're under control

I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you'll never know

When the daylight comes you feel so cold,
You know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

Waiting for the fire to light
Feeling like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control

CHASING STARS LYRICS:
It was just like magic
When your hips came crashing
There were fires burning and my hands learning
To paint with passion
It was planets meeting
It was synced up breathing
There were angels calling and more free falling
Than I believed it
Memories like freight trains hit me
I replay to keep you with me
Better to have had than not at all
We were chasing stars
Across the county lines
Two imperfect pieces with our fingers intertwined
I would do it all again
Knowing I’d be left behind
Ohh what a time
Back when you were mine
Oh im hurting
But im still certain
That when the pain comes back in waves yea it was worth it
Memories like freight trains hit me
I replay to keep you with me
Better to have had than not at all
We were chasing stars
Across the county lines
Two imperfect pieces with our fingers intertwined
I would do it all again
Knowing I’d be left behind
Ohh what a time
Back when you were mine
Ohh we were chasing stars
Ohh we were chasing stars
We were chasing stars
Across the county lines
Two imperfect pieces with our fingers intertwined
I would do it all again
Knowing I’d be left behind
Ohh what a time
Back when you were mine
Ohh we were chasing stars
Ohh we were chasing stars

LYRICS: 

I didn't know that I was broken until I found my missing piece.
It seemed like every door was closing on me.
You were so far out of reach.

Drunk on the night.
You got lips like your wine.
I got nothing but time for you.
Feeling so high on that look in your eyes.
I got nothing but time for you.

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe,
That loneliness is my disease.
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe,
That you are the remedy.
You are the remedy.
You are the remedy. 

I didn't have no one to turn to.
I was circling the drain.
But now you showed me I can learn too.
How to be okay again.

Drunk on the night.
You got lips like your wine.
I got nothing but time for you.
Feeling so high on that look in your eyes.
I got nothing but time for you.

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe,
That loneliness is my disease.
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe,
That you are the remedy. 
You are the remedy.
You are the remedy.

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe,
That loneliness is my disease.
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe,
That you are the remedy.
You are the remedy.
You are the remedy.

Only You Lyrics:

We know its over but it’s alright  
We’ll keep dancin in these bright lights 
Boy, just take me for a night drive 
Cos I can’t breath..  
We know we’re broken but it’s alright 
Babe, just hold me till the sunrise 
You know it’s only a matter of time  
Just me and you tonight 

Only you and I  
Just me and you tonight 

Only you and I  
Babe it’s only a matter of time  

Always you and I  
Just me and you tonight  X2
