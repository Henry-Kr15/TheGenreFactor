[Lyrics]
The loves were playing in the yard
Giving goosebumps to all the Sunday summer trees
Our hands were tangled in the weeds
Moving so softly, nobody can see
Against your morning skin
Well, it's shy like two young lovers walking by
There's a soft strange kind of art
Giving company to all the lonely hearts

There's a hundred cigarettes on the ground
And our clothes are still hanging around
And it's nice to be ugly in each other's arms
So we can grow over all the things we were before

Official video for ""The Great Escape"" by Patrick Watson from the album Close to Paradise (2006, Secret City Records).

[lyrics]
Bad day, looking for a way home,
looking for the great escape.
Gets in his car and drives away,
far from all the things that we are.
Puts on a smile and breathes it in
and breathes it out, he says,
bye bye bye to all of the noise.
Oh, he says, bye bye bye to all of the noise.

Doo doo doo doo doo noo noo
Doo doo doo doo doo noo noo noo noo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo noo noo noo

Hey child, things are looking down.
That's okay, you don't need to win anyways.
Don't be afraid, just eat up all the gray
and it will fade all away.
Don't let yourself fall down.

Doo doo doo doo doo noo noo
Doo doo doo doo doo noo noo noo noo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo noo noo noo

Bad day, looking for the great escape.
He says, bad day, looking for the great escape.
On a bad day, looking for the great escape,
the great escape.

SYNOPSIS
Love Songs For Robots is our attempt to create the sort of film Martians might make for humans, if those Martians had only observed us from afar. The piece is inspired by the sculpture and ballet of the avant-garde artist Oskar Schlemmer, with choreography and dance by Mistaya Hemingway (La La La Human Steps).

DIRECTOR‚ÄôS BIO
Chris Lavis and Maciek Szczerbowski are academy award nominated directors and animators. Their film ""Madame Tutli-Putli"" (NFB) won multiple awards at the Cannes film festival and was nominated for the best animated short Oscar. They also wrote and directed ""Higgelty-Piggelty Pop!"" (Warner Bros, NFB), commissioned by Spike Jonze and featuring the voice of Meryl Streep.  ""Love Songs for Robots"" is the fourth collaboration with Patrick Watson, after the stereoscopic animation ""Cochemare""(Phi Films) the virtual reality project ""Strangers with Patrick Watson"" (in collaboration with Felix & Paul studios) and the music video ""Places You Will Go"".

A Film By Chris Lavis and Maciek Szczerbowski, with Music and Sound Design by Patrick Watson.

Busta Rhymes‚Äô ability to combine the musical lineage of ragga with brilliantly original lyrics makes him one of the most respected MCs in hip hop history. After breaking with the group, Leaders of the New School, Rhymes released his first solo studio album ‚ÄúThe Coming‚Äù (1996), which featured the hit single ‚ÄúWoo Hah!! Got You All In Check‚Äù. 

His subsequent work has been met with cultural,critical, and commercial acclaim. His Elektra solo albums ‚ÄúWhen Disaster Strikes‚Ä¶‚Äù (1997), ‚ÄúGenesis‚Äù (2001), and ‚ÄúThe Big Bang,‚Äù which debuted at No. 1 in 2006, represent just a portion of the prodigious artistic output that charted Busta Rhymes path to certified hip hop royalty.

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah, as a shorty, playing in the front yard of the crib
Fell down, and I bumped my head
Somebody helped me up and asked me if I bumped my head
I said, ""Yeah""
So then they said, ""Oh, so that mean we gon', you gon' switch it on 'em?""
I said' ""Yeah, Flipmode, Flipmode is the greatest""
Knowing as a shorty, I was always told
That if I ain't gon' be part of the greatest
I gotta be the greatest myself

[Verse 1]
C'mon, c'mon, yeah, c'mon
Yeah, nigga, what? What a surprise
Give ya Some'n, make a nigga close both of your eyes
All my niggas gettin' money capitalize
Die little small guy, we on the rise
Everything a nigga touch platinumize
Fully equipped, you know we come wit' all the supplies
Got a big gun, and I'ma show you the size
You fuck wit' any of my Flipmode family ties
Me and my niggas be comin' through stalkin' you out
Killin' off any and everything you talkin' about
See you in the club, now we walkin' you out
Shoulda' thought twice 'fo you went and opened your mouth
Yo, anyway we stay keepin it movin'
Fuckin' with the wrong nigga, hope you know what you doin'
Now blame me, all the same niggas is lame
It's not a game, makin' names still splittin' your frames!

[Chorus]
Y'all niggas had enough? (Gimme some more)
Y'all niggas want the wild shit? (Gimme some more)
Yo, Spliff, where the weed at? (Gimme some more)
I know ya'll niggas need that (Gimme some more)
Even though we getting money you can (Gimme some more)
With the cars and the big crib (Gimme some more)
Everybody spread love (Gimme some more)
If you want it let me hear you say it (Gimme some more)

[Verse 2]
Flash with a rash gimme my cash flickin' my ash
Runnin' with my money son go out with a blast
Do what you want, a nigga's cuttin' the corner
You fuckin' up the order, go ahead and meet the reporter
Yo, she tellin' news on how you switch to a bitch
Little fake funny style, nigga chill with a snitch
So now I pass you straight up I don't got nothing to ask you
Make a little room for me and all my niggas to pass through
Cartier, Sidney Poitier, hooray shit
What with all my niggas from around the way shit
When I come through you niggas know I do my thing
Bring more shit that generate money, cha-ching
Arrest you lyrically flow and caress you
Bless you, then a nigga come to your rescue

I'm comin' soon, hit you with a boom, gimme some room!

[Chorus]
Y'all niggas had enough? (Gimme some more)
Y'all niggas want the wild shit? (Gimme some more)
Yo, Spliff, where the weed at? (Gimme some more)
I know ya'll niggas need that (Gimme some more)
Even though we getting money you can (Gimme some more)

Everybody spread love (Gimme some more)

[Verse 3]
Yo (Yo)

Never should you ever try to fuck wit' my cream

Every time we be rippin' it, be blowing it down
Blowing you off fuckin' wit' the hottest niggas around ('round)
Ruckus when me and my people run through your town
Holdin' it down takin' a while and then gimme my crown
Aye, (Yo) all my people need to come and surround
A nigga be hittin' so much it make you fall on the ground
Sure to make you shout that's what I be all about
Turnin' you out makin' all you niggas fall out!

[Chorus]

Busta Rhymes‚Äô ability to combine the musical lineage of ragga with brilliantly original lyrics makes him one of the most respected MCs in hip hop history. After breaking with the group, Leaders of the New School, Rhymes released his first solo studio album ‚ÄúThe Coming‚Äù (1996), which featured the hit single ‚ÄúWoo Hah!! Got You All In Check‚Äù. 

His subsequent work has been met with cultural,critical, and commercial acclaim. His Elektra solo albums ‚ÄúWhen Disaster Strikes‚Ä¶‚Äù (1997), ‚ÄúGenesis‚Äù (2001), and ‚ÄúThe Big Bang,‚Äù which debuted at No. 1 in 2006, represent just a portion of the prodigious artistic output that charted Busta Rhymes path to certified hip hop royalty.

[Intro]
It‚Äôs a pilot
It‚Äôs a good good good good
It‚Äôs a hybrid
It‚Äôs a movie, it‚Äôs a pilot
It‚Äôs a private, you should fly it
Got a good strand, you should try it
It‚Äôs exotic, it‚Äôs a hybrid
Girl I got some good news
Can I run it by you?
 
[Snoop Dogg verse]
Mommy pilot bad enough I let her fly it
Keep a pistol in the glove compartment
In a tinted Rolls-Royce spilling Kush crumbs sippin gin and O. J.
Seen you pull up in the Porsche lookin more free than a new divorcee
We ain‚Äôt gotta go overseas
I can walk you ‚Äòround through the LB
I can teach you how to fly it
As long as I‚Äôm the first one to ride it
Baby when we get to soaring
Flying over California Cinematic movie score
Pack yah bags and get on board
We can go to places abroad Think about a get away with the Dogg
We ain‚Äôt even gotta leave the resort
You can roll another bleez if you want
 
[Anderson .Paak]
[Chorus]
It‚Äôs a movie, it‚Äôs a pilot

Got so lucky when I found you
How you rep me girl you make me proud boo
When we fuck it got me screaming loud too [laughs]
What it do, laughing at me girl I will allow you
Baby girl I‚Äôm sorry learnt it from my mommy
After her who else I‚Äôm gonna bow to
Together look we lit up every time we get up Drink until the point a ***** spit up
Ride or die together like we on some gang shit if we was bloodn or we crip up
Before you diss my Queen better shut your lip up
While I talk about you let me sip up Mommy pilot nice enough to fly you
Comfort level stellar baby how you?
 
[Anderson .Paak]

Lyrics:

Act a fool you better watch out (Uh-huh)
Hot shit be ringin the cops out (Come On)
Street niggas is ringin them shots out
Short circuits blacken the blocks out
Now open up the garage and pull the drops out
Rockin the fur coat bringin the blue fox out
Diamonds light up the block runnin the blue rocks out (Uh)
Wylin till all of my crew knocked out (Come On)
Get yo' ass up on the floor (Huh!)
Throw ya hands if you wan't some more (Ho!!!)
Baby, we'll leave your crotch out
And peep the way we be blowin them spots out
Come on, look how we got 'em ready to act out
Girl, I'm ready to give it twistin your back out (Let's go)
Drink yack till a nigga fallin out
Flat on his back now watch a nigga crawlin out, talk to me

I said Busta (What's up son?)
Leave them girl rollin....And it look like (Come on)
They asses is swollen (And they ass gettin big now)
But if your man baby sittin, then what you gon' say
(What we gon' tell 'em man?)
We gon' tell that nigga (Pass the Courvoisier)
We gon' tell that brotha (Pass the Courvoisier)

Lyrics
The kiss of Venus
Has got me on the go
She scored a bullseye
In the early morning glow
Early morning glow

(Verse 1)
Have ya 
Read the paper 
People talkin 
About which side they‚Äôre takin 
And if you know then baby what‚Äôs your take on it 
Does it make you want to leave 
Cuz I could look the other way for ya 

Reflected mountains in a lake
Is this too much to take?
Asleep or wide awake?
And if the world begins to shake
Will something have to break?
Or would we stay awake?

The kiss of Venus
Has got me on the go
She scored a bullseye
In the early morning glow
Early morning glow

(Verse 2) 
Have ya read the paper 
people talkin 
Without no education 
Go to college 
Go find your major 
Realize you‚Äôre minor in the scheme of everything

MPL and the Concord Music Group are proud to announce two more landmark instalments in the multiple GRAMMY-winning Paul McCartney Archive Collection. 

On 2nd October, 2015, Paul‚Äôs early ‚Äò80s back-to-back classics 'Tug of War' and 'Pipes of Peace' will receive lavish multiple configuration reissue treatment including exclusive 2015 remixes of both the entire 'Tug of War' album and the 'Pipes of Peace' classic collaboration with Michael Jackson 'Say Say Say,' a treasure trove of previously unreleased tracks and never before seen video, and much more.

Released in 1982, 'Tug of War' was Paul‚Äôs first album following the break-up of Wings and his third solo LP overall. Hailed upon its release as ‚Äúexquisitely crafted‚Äù by The New York Times and a ‚Äúmasterpiece‚Äù by Rolling Stone, 'Tug of War' went to #1 in no less than nine countries. 'Tug of War' yielded such classic tracks as Paul‚Äôs #1 duet with Stevie Wonder 'Ebony and Ivory,' the top 10 single 'Take It Away,' and of course 'Here Today,' the conversation Paul never had with the late John Lennon that remains a staple of Paul‚Äôs live set to this day.

As with the GRAMMY-winning 'Band on the Run' and 'Wings Over America' Archive editions, Paul personally supervised all aspects of these releases and their various formats, which include:
 
'Tug of War' will be issued as a 2-CD Special Edition comprised of the 2015 remix of the entire album, plus a second disc of bonus audio featuring eight previously unreleased demos of both album tracks and outtakes 'Stop, You Don‚Äôt Know Where She Came From' and 'Something That Didn‚Äôt Happen,' as well as demo and solo versions of 'Ebony and Ivory' and more. 

The 'Tug Of War' 3-CD/1-DVD Deluxe Edition adds the original 1982 album mix and a DVD featuring original music videos for the album‚Äôs singles and the brand new 18-minute documentary 'Fly TIA‚ÄîBehind The Scenes on Take It Away' featuring previously unseen archival footage.

Letra:
Estoy llorando en mi habitaci√≥n
Todo se nubla a mi alrededor
Ella se fue con un ni√±o pijo
En un Ford fiesta blanco
Y un jersey amarillo

Por el parque les veo pasar
Cuando se besan lo paso fatal
Voy a vengarme de ese marica
Voy a llenarle el cuello
De polvos pica pica

Sufre mam√≥n, devu√©lveme a mi chica
O te retorcer√°s entre polvos pica pica
Sufre mam√≥n, devu√©lveme a mi chica
O te retorcer√°s entre polvos pica pica

Le he quemado su jersey
Y se ha comprado cinco o seis
Voy a destrozarle el coche
Lo tengo preparado, voy esta noche

No te reir√°s nunca mas de mi
Lo siento nene vas a morir
Tu me quitaste lo que mas quer√≠a
Y volver√° conmigo volver√° alg√∫n d√≠a

Sufre mam√≥n, devu√©lveme a mi chica
O te retorcer√°s entre polvos pica pica
Sufre mam√≥n, devu√©lveme a mi chica
O te retorcer√°s entre polvos pica pica

(Sufre mam√≥n) sufre mam√≥n, devu√©lveme a mi chica

LYRICS:
The evil it spread like a fever ahead
It was night when you died, my firefly
What could I have said to raise you from the dead? 
Oh could I be the sky on the fourth of July?

‚ÄúWell you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We‚Äôre all gonna die.‚Äù

Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head 
Was it all a disguise, like Junior High
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
Now where am I? My fading supply

‚ÄúDid you get enough love, my little dove
Why do you cry?
And I‚Äôm sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt right
My little Versailles.‚Äù

The hospital asked should the body be cast 
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?

‚ÄúShall we look at the moon, my little loon
Why do you cry?
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
While it is light

Well you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We‚Äôre all gonna die.‚Äù",True,True,193705968.0,indie folk

Its soundtrack is a mix of 80s pop, classical compositions & songs by singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens, including two songs written specifically for the film.

Listen to the full soundtrack: https://soundtracks.lnk.to/CallMeByYourName

While the soundtrack for CALL ME BY YOUR NAME is a compilation of tracks by numerous musicians, Guadagnino decided he wanted to approach American singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens to create a song especially for the film. ‚ÄúAn artist for whom I have enormous admiration is Sufjan. His voice is fantastic and angelic, and his lyrics are so sharp and deep and full of sorrow and beauty. The music is so haunting. All these elements were the ones I wanted to envision in the film.‚Äù

While Guadagnino knew that Stevens had never collaborated on a movie before, he reached out. Stevens read the book, they had a long conversation, and the result was that he wrote not one, but two original songs for the film: ‚ÄúMystery of Love‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisions of Gideon‚Äù. 

The soundtrack for CALL ME BY YOUR NAME also includes tracks by John Adams and Ryuichi Sakamoto as well as pieces written by Erik Satie, Maurice Ravel and Johann Sebastian Bach. As the film is set in the 1980s, Guadagnino chose period Italian pop music (including Giorgio Moroder & Joe Esposito‚Äôs ‚ÄúLady Lady Lady‚Äù) for the radio, but particularly spotlights The Psychedelic Furs‚Äô anthem ‚ÄúLove My Way‚Äù. ‚ÄúI love The Psychedelic Furs,‚Äù says Guadagnino. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of autobiographical, because I remember listening to that song when I was seventeen and being completely affected by it. I wanted to pay homage to myself then.‚Äù

LYRICS:
Spirit of my silence I can hear you
But I‚Äôm afraid to be near you
And I don‚Äôt know where to begin
And I don‚Äôt know where to begin

Somewhere in the desert there‚Äôs a forest 
And an acre before us
But I don‚Äôt know where to begin
But I don‚Äôt know where to begin
Again I‚Äôve lost my strength completely, oh be near me,
Tired old mare with the wind in your hair

Amethyst and flowers on the table, is it real or a fable?
Well I suppose a friend is a friend
And we all know how this will end

Chimney swift that finds me, be my keeper
Silhouette of the cedar
What is that song you sing for the dead?
What is that song you sing for the dead?
I see the signal searchlight strike me in the window of my room
Well I got nothing to prove
Well I got nothing to prove

I forgive you, mother, I can hear you
And I long to be near you
But every road leads to an end
Yes every road leads to an end

LYRICS:

I should have known better
To see what I could see
My black shroud
Holding down my feelings
A pillar for my enemies

I should have wrote a letter
And grieve what I happen to grieve
My black shroud
I never trust my feelings
I waited for the remedy

When I was three, three maybe four
She left us at that video store
Be my rest, be my fantasy

I‚Äôm light as a feather
I‚Äôm bright as the Oregon breeze
My black shroud 
Frightened by my feelings
I only want to be a relief

No, I‚Äôm not a go-getter
The demon had a spell on me
My black shroud
Captain of my feelings
The only thing I want to believe

When I was three, and free to explore
I saw her face on the back of the door
Be my vest, be my fantasy

I should have known better
Nothing can be changed
The past is still the past
The bridge to nowhere
I should‚Äôve wrote a letter 
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling

Don‚Äôt back down, concentrate on seeing
The breakers in the bar, the neighbor‚Äôs greeting
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination

Don‚Äôt back down, there is nothing left
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live
I‚Äôm a fool in the fetter
Rose of Aaron‚Äôs beard, where you can reach me

Don‚Äôt back down: nothing can be changed
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination

LYRICS:
The only thing that keeps me from driving this car
Half-light, jack knife into the canyon at night
Signs and wonders: Perseus aligned with the skull
Slain Medusa, Pegasus alight from us all

Do I care if I survive this? Bury the dead where they‚Äôre found
In a veil of great surprises: I wonder did you love me at all?

The only thing that keeps me from cutting my arm
Cross hatch, warm bath, Holiday Inn after dark
Signs and wonders: water stain writing the wall
Daniel‚Äôs message, blood of the moon on us all

Do I care if I despise this? Nothing else matters, I know
In a veil of great disguises: How do I live with your ghost?

Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you somehow
I want to save you from your sorrow

The only reason why I continue at all
Faith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumb  
Signs and wonders: sea lion caves in the dark
Blind faith, God‚Äôs grace, nothing else left to impart

Do I care if I survive this? Bury the dead where they‚Äôre found
In a veil of great surprises, hold to my head till I drown
Should I tear my eyes out now, before I see too much?
Should I tear my arms out now? I want to feel your touch

Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you somehow",True,True,115351781.0,indie folk

{Don't worry, I won't hurt you
I only want you to have some fun}
I was dreamin' when I wrote this, forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this mornin', could've sworn it was judgment day
The sky was all purple, there were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' to run from the destruction, you know I didn't even care
Say say two thousand zero zero party over, oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's nineteen ninety-nine
I was dreamin' when I wrote this, so sue me if I go too fast
But life is just a party and parties weren't meant to last
War is all around us, my mind says prepare to fight
So if I gotta die I'm gonna listen to my body tonight
Yeah hey, they say two thousand zero zero party over, oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's nineteen ninety-nine

Lyrics:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people look at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Tsar
But the kazachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

[Spoken:]
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger
For power became known to more and more people
The demands to do something about this outrageous
Man became louder and louder

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

""This man's just got to go!"" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged ""Don't you try to do it, please""
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
""Come to visit us"" they kept demanding
And he really came

RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and said ""I feel fine""

RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead

[Spoken:] Oh, those Russians...

Lyrics:

By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down
ye-eah we wept, when we remembered Zion.

By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down
ye-eah we wept, when we remembered Zion.

When the wicked
Carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
Now how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land

When the wicked
Carried us away in captivity
Requiering of us a song
Now how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land

Let the words of our mouth and the meditations of our heart
be acceptable in thy sight here tonight

Let the words of our mouth and the meditation of our hearts
be acceptable in thy sight here tonight

By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down
ye-eah we wept, when we remembered Zion.

By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down
ye-eah we wept, when we remembered Zion.

By the rivers of Babylon (dark tears of Babylon)
there we sat down (You got to sing a song)
ye-eah we wept, (Sing a song of love)
when we remember Zion. (Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

By the rivers of Babylon (Rough bits of Babylon)
there we sat down (You hear the people cry)
ye-eah we wept, (They need their God)
when we remember Zion. (Ooh, have the power)

Les quatre membres originels du groupe sont Bobby Farrell (qui est d√©c√©d√© le 30 d√©cembre 2010 √† Saint-P√©tersbourg en Russie), Liz Mitchell, Maizie Williams, et Marcia Barrett. Reggie Tsiboe a chant√© avec eux de 1982 √† 1985, sa photo n'apparaissant toutefois pas sur le site officiel.

Histoire

En d√©cembre 1974, le chanteur-compositeur allemand Frank Farian (de son vrai nom Franz Reuther), qui travaille pour le label allemand Hansa Records, enregistre en studio, avec des musiciens de s√©ance, Baby Do You Wanna Bump?, dont il fait √† la fois la voix grave et les voix de fausset. Mis sur le march√© par Farian qui a pris le pseudonyme de Boney M., le titre conna√Æt un grand succ√®s aux Pays-Bas et en Belgique.

Il forme un groupe √† la va-vite pour en assurer la promotion dans les bo√Ætes de nuit et √† la t√©l√©vision. Il engage des choristes antillaises : Maizie Williams, originaire de l'√Æle de Montserrat, Sheyla Bonnick, chanteuse jama√Øcaine, et un danseur du nom de ¬´ Mike ¬ª (dans les premiers temps).

En 1975, Sheila Bonnick est remplac√©e par Claudja Barry (qui avait succ√©d√© √† Donna Summer dans la com√©die musicale Hair) et le d√©nomm√© Mike par Bobby Farrell, danseur exotique originaire de l'√Æle d'Aruba dans les Petites Antilles. La chanteuse jama√Øcaine Marcia Barrett int√®gre √† son tour le groupe. En 1976, Liz Mitchell, ancien membre des Humphries Singers, remplace Claudja Barry, d√©missionnaire, lass√©e de ne faire que de la synchronisation labiale.

Le groupe est d√©sormais constitu√© de Liz Mitchell, Maizie Williams, Marcia Barrett, et de Bobby Farrell.

Si officiellement Bobby Farrell est le danseur et chanteur du groupe, la voix rocailleuse est celle de Frank Farian lui-m√™me, modifi√©e par l'√©lectronique et enregistr√©e sur bande magn√©tique. De m√™me, Maizie Williams n'a jamais chant√© de toute sa carri√®re au sein du groupe. La plupart des chansons sont chant√©es par Liz Mitchell et Frank Farian, Marcia Barrett faisant les ch≈ìurs, et quelques chansons en solo (notamment Belfast).

L'image de Boney M., trois filles prostern√©es aux pieds d'un ma√Ætre vaudou aux allures de prox√©n√®te, a sans doute contribu√© au succ√®s du groupe, mais c'est surtout la qualit√© des m√©lodies et des instrumentations, tr√®s travaill√©es, qui expliquent le triomphe ph√©nom√©nal que remporta la formation en Europe avec les titres Daddy Cool (1976), Sunny (1977) ou Ma Baker (1977) ainsi que leur version du classique reggae des Melodians, Rivers of Babylon (1978), troisi√®me meilleure vente de 45 tours de toute l'histoire des classements britanniques.

Apr√®s Rasputin (1978) et une reprise du Painter Man de The Creation (1979), le groupe conna√Æt ses derniers tubes disco avec Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday! (1979), Gotta go Home (1979) et El Lute (1979).

L'ann√©e 1980 est relativement calme avec la parution de quatre singles : Bahama Mama, My friend Jack (qui sert de fer de lance √† la premi√®re compilation du groupe - The magic of Boney M.), Children of paradise et Felicidad (qui replace le groupe dans le top 10 de nombreux pays).

S'ensuit une tourn√©e en Afrique et l'enregistrement de l'album Boonoonoonoos qui para√Ætra √† l'automne 1981.

En 1982, Bobby Farrell quitte le groupe et est remplac√© par Reggie Tsiboe, jusqu'√† sa r√©int√©gration dans le groupe en 1984.

Les sorties commerciales s'espacent et l'album Ten thousand lightyears ne sort qu'en 1984. Le groupe, en perte de vitesse, ne rencontre pas le succ√®s qu'il avait connu au c≈ìur des ann√©es disco.

Il faut attendre l'enregistrement de Kalimba de Luna et de Happy song pour retrouver le groupe dans les charts europ√©ens.

En 1985, Boney M. sort son ultime album Eye dance. L'album sera un √©chec commercial et apr√®s un show c√©l√©brant leurs 10 ans de carri√®re et la sortie d'un best of, les membres du groupe se s√©parent en 1986.

En 1989, alors que Liz, Marcia, Maizie et Bobby sont tous dispers√©s dans le monde, le groupe originel se reforme et triomphe √† nouveau en Europe avec un ¬´ Megamix ¬ª (n¬∞ 1 en France), suivi du ¬´ Summer Megamix ¬ª : il s'agit d'un medley reprenant tous les tubes dans une nouvelle version. La mode des ¬´ Megamix ¬ª sera alors lanc√©e et de nombreux artistes tenteront l'exp√©rience. Ce sera la derni√®re fois o√π les quatre membres officiels de Boney M. seront sur sc√®ne ensemble.

Entre 1975 et 1986, Boney M. a vendu environ 150 millions de disques :

42 disques d'or ;
50 disques de platine ;
50 disques de diamant.

De 2006 √† 2010, chaque membre originel du groupe se produit avec sa propre formation sous le label ¬´ Boney M. ¬ª

Lyrics:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people look at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Tsar
But the kazachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

[Spoken:]
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger
For power became known to more and more people
The demands to do something about this outrageous
Man became louder and louder

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

""This man's just got to go!"" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged ""Don't you try to do it, please""
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
""Come to visit us"" they kept demanding
And he really came

RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and said ""I feel fine""

RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead

[Spoken:] Oh, those Russians...

Lyrics:

FREEZE! I'm Ma Baker - put your hands in the air,
gimme all your money

- This is the story of Ma Baker, the meanest cat
from ol' Chicago town

She was the meanest cat
In old Chicago town
She was the meanest cat
She really moved them down
She had no heart at all
No no no heart at all

She was the meanest cat
Oh she was really tough
She left her husband flat
He wasn't tough enough
She took her boys along
'cos they were mean and strong

Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she taught her four sons
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - to handle their guns
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she never could cry
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - but she knew how to die

They left a trail of crime
Across the U.S.A.
And when one boy was killed
She really made them pay
She had no heart at all
No no no heart at all

Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she taught her four sons
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - to handle their guns
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she never could cry
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - but she knew how to die

she met a man she liked
she thought she'd stay with him
one day he formed with them
they did away with him
she didn't care at all
just didn't care at all

- Here is a special bulletin.
Ma Baker is the FBI's most wanted woman.
Her photo is hanging on every post office wall.
If you have any information about this woman,
please contact the nearest police station...

- Don't anybody move! The money or your lives!

One day they robbed a bank
it was their last foray
the cops appeared too soon
they couldn't get away
and all the loot they had
it made them mighty mad
and so they shot it out
Ma Baker and her sons
they didn't want to hang
they died with blazing guns
and so the story ends
of one who left no friends

Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she taught her four sons
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - to handle their guns
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she never could cry
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - but she knew how to die

Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she taught her four sons
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - to handle their guns
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she never could cry
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - but she knew how to die

Lyrics:

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.

Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible say,
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

While shepherds watch their flock by night,
They see a bright new shining star,
They hear a choir sing a song, the music seem to come from afar.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.

For a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted
""Let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace.""

Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night,
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight.

And then they found a little nook, in a stable all forlorn,
And in a manger cold 'n' dark, Mary's little boy was born.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted
""let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"".

Oh My Lord...

We're ready man and packed to go
When we hit those islands
There's gonna be a big hello
Diggin' all the sunshine
It's easy not to say goodbye
Bye Bye Bye

Headin' for the islands
Heyeah, We're really flyin' high
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home

Walkin' down the beaches
Tomorrow mornin' we'll be there
Golden sandy beaches
Say, I can smell the breezy air
One more celebration
And then we're ready for goodbye
Bye, Bye,Bye

Walkin' down the beaches

Lyrics:

I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive

I'll fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again...

Lyrics:
Living on the road my friend was gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear your skin like iron and your breath's as hard as kerosene
You weren't your mama's only boy but her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye and sank into your dreams
Poncho was a bandit boy, his horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants for all the honest world to feel
Poncho met his match you know on the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dyin' words ah but that's the way it goes
All the Federales say they could've had him any day
They only let him slip away out of kindness I suppose
Lefty he can't sing the blues all night long the way he used to
The dust that Poncho bit down south ended up in Lefty's mouth
Day they laid poor Poncho low Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go there ain't nobody knows
All the Federales say they could've had him any day
They only let him slip away out of kindness I suppose
The poets tell how Poncho fell and Lefty's living in a cheap hotel
The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold and so the story ends we're told
Poncho needs your prayers it's true but save a few for Lefty too
He only did what he had to do and now he's growing old
They only let him go so long out of kindness I suppose
A few great Federales say could've had him any day
They only let him go so long out of kindness I suppose

Lyrics:
When it's not always raining
There'll be days like this
When there's no one complaining
There'll be days like this
When everything falls into place
Like the flick of a switch
Well my mama told me
There'll be days like this

When you don't need to worry
There'll be days like this
When no one's in a hurry
There'll be days like this
When all the parts of the puzzle
Start to look like they fit
Then I must remember
There'll be days like this

When you don't need an answer
There'll be days like this
When you don't meet a chancer
There'll be days like this
When you don't get betrayed
By that old Judas kiss
Oh my mama told me
There'll be days like this

When everyone is up front
And they're not playing tricks
When you don't have no freeloaders
Out to get their kicks
When it's nobody's business
The way that you want to live
I just have to remember
There'll be days like this

When no one steps on my dreams
There'll be days like this
When people understand what I mean
There'll be days like this
When you ring out the changes
Of how everything is
Well my mama told me
There'll be days like this

Oh my mama told me
There'll be days like this
Oh my mama told me
There'll be days like this
Oh my mama told me
There'll be days like this
Oh my mama told me
There'll be days like this

Roars out just like thunder

Lyrics:

Ex-Factor
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually

I wrote these words for everyone
Who struggles in their youth
Who won't accept deception
Instead of what is truth
It seems we lose the game,
Before we even start to play
Who made these rules? We're so confused
Easily led astray
Let me tell ya that
Ex-Factor
Ex-Factor
After winter, must come spring

I need you baby, if it's quite all right,
I need you baby to warm a lonely night.
I love you baby.
Trust in me when I say, OK. (it's OK)
Oh pretty baby, Don't let me down, I pray.
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay.
And let me love you, oh baby let me love you, oh baby...

I'm soakin' up the game, I'm seein' how it's done
I ask shawty what they call it, she said 'the Pool Palace'
Straight from Bankhead, I said 'you good at it'
Do what'cha do, you and ya crew

The mo' that I drank, the more it's lookin' smooth
It's nuthin' to a boss, I can do the s___ too

Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!

Reppin' my block, straight from the Dec
When you snap ya fingers shawty, gotta jerk ya neck
Smokin' on the best, we don't ____ wit dat mess
I bet you can't do it, do it, do it like this

Letras:

He intentadocasi todo para 
convencerte
Mientras el mundo se
derrumba todo aqu√≠ a mis pies
Mientras aprendo de esta
soledad que desconozco
Me vuelvo a preguntar quiz√°s
si sobrevivir√©
Porque sin t√≠ me queda la
conciencia helada y vac√≠a
Porque sin t√≠ me he dado
cuenta amor que no renacer√©
Porque he ido m√°s all√° del
limite de la desolaci√≥n
Mi cuerpo, mi mente y mi
alma ya no tienen conexi√≥n
Y te juro que...

Lo dejaria todo porque 
te quedaras
Mi credo mi pasado mi religi√≥n
Despu√©s de todo est√°s
rompiendo nuestros lazos
Y dejas en pedazos este
coraz√≥n
Mi piel tambi√©n la dejar√≠a, mi 
nombre, mi fuerza
Hasta m√≠ propia vida
Y qu√© m√°s d√° perder
Si te llevas del todo mi fe
Qu√© no dejar√≠a

Letras:

Mil y una historia me he inventado
Para estar aqui aqui a tu lado...
Y no te das cuenta que
Yo no encuentro ya que hacer.
Se que piensas que no he sido sincero
Se que piensas que ya no tengo remedio
Pero quien me iba decir que sin ti no se vivir...
Y ahora que no estas aqui
Me doy cuenta cuanta falta me haces....

Si te he fallado te pido perdon de la unica forma que se..
Abriendo las puertas de mi corazon
Para cuando decidas vover
Porque nunca habra nadie que pueda llenar
El vacio que dejaste en mi....
Has cambiado mi vida me has hecho crecer
Es que no soy el mismo de ayer
Un dia es un siglo sin ti...

Letras:

En palabras simples y comunes yo te extra√±o
En lenguaje terrenal mi vida eres t√∫
En total simplicidad ser√≠a yo te amo
Y en un trozo de poes√≠a tu ser√°s mi luz, mi bien,
el espacio donde me alimento de tu piel que es bondad
La fuerza que me mueve dentro para recomenzar
y en tu cuerpo encontrar la paz

Si la vida me permite al lado tuyo
crecer√°n mis ilusiones no lo dudo,
Y si la vida la perdiera en un instante
que me llene de t√≠
Para amar despues de amarte, vida

No tengas miedos ni dudas, (que este amor es demasiado bueno)
que t√∫ seras mi mujer (yo te pertenezco todo, entero)
Mira mi pecho, lo dejo abierto
Para que vivas en √©l

Para tu tranquilidad me tienes en tus manos
Para mi debilidad, la √∫nica eres t√∫
Al final tan solo s√© que siempre te he esperado
Y que llegas a mi vida y t√∫ me das la luz, el bien
ese mundo donde tus palabras hacen su voluntad
La magia de este sentimiento que es tan fuerte y total
Y tus ojos que son mi paz

Si la vida me permite al lado tuyo
crecer√°n mis ilusiones no lo dudo,
Y si lavida la perdiera en un instante
que me llene de t√≠
Para amar despues de amarte, vida

Letras:

Nunca imagine la vida sin ti 
todo lo q me plantie, siempre estabas tu 
solo tu sabes bien quien soy 
de donde vengo y a donde voy 
nunca t he mentido nunca t he escondido nada 
siempre me tuviste cuando me necesitabas 
nadie mejor q tu sabra 
q di todo lo q pude dar 
*y ahora y tu t vas 
asi como si nada (y tu t vas) 
acortandome la vida, agachando la mirada 
y tu t vas 
y yo... q me pierdo entre la nada (y tu t vas) 
donde quedan las palabras 
y el amor q me jurabas... y tu t vas..oohh..oohh 

Si esq t he fallado dime como y cuando a sido 
si es q t has cansado y ahora me hechas al olvido 
no habra nadie q t amara 
asi como yo t puedo amar 

Por mas mas q busco no encuentro razon

Letras:

Cuando estoy contigo crece mi esperanza
vas alimentando el amor de mi alma
y sin pensarlo el tiempo me rob√≥ el aliento,
qu√© ser√° de m√≠ si no te tengo?

Si no est√°s conmigo se me escapa el aire, coraz√≥n vac√≠o.
Estando en tus brazos s√≥lo a tu lado siento que respiro...
No hay nada que cambiar, no hay nada que decir.
Si no est√°s conmigo quedo entre la nada, me muero de fr√≠o.
Ay! cuanto te amo, si no es a tu lado pierdo los sentidos...
Hay tanto que inventar, no hay nada que fingir... ""me enamor√© de t√≠""
me enamor√© de t√≠...

Eres lo que yo m√°s quiero, lo que yo he so√±ado amar...
eres mi rayo de luz a cada ma√±ana...
y sin pensarlo el tiempo me rob√≥ el aliento,
que ser√° de m√≠ si no te tengo?",True,True,70993793.0,Latin pop

With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel

#AlanJackson #RememberWhen #CountryMusic

Lyrics:
Remember when I was young and so were you
And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when

Remember when we vowed the vows
And walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt
Remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when

Remember when the sound of little feet
Was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
Remember when

Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now lookn' back it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are
Where we've been
Said we'd do it all again
Remember when
Remember when we said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when",True,True,104962016.0,country music

Lyrics:
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change
Any other day
I would call and you would say
Baby how's your day
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word
Is ""uh-huh"" yeah ""okay""
Could it be that you
Are at the crib with another lady
If you took it there
First of all, let me say
I am not the one
To sit around, and be played
So prove yourself to me
I am the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the thangs
That you said to me yesterday
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth
If somebody's there then tell me who
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change
What is up with this
Tell the truth, who you with
How would you like it if
I came over with my clique
Don't try to change it now
See you gotta bounce
When two seconds ago
You said you just got in the house
It's hard to believe that you
Are at home, by yourself
When I just heard the voice
Heard the voice of someone else
Just this question why
Do you feel you gotta lie
Gettin' caught up in your game
When you can not say my name
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth
If somebody's there then tell me who
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change
I know you say that I am assuming things

Lyrics:
At first we started out real cool 
Taking me places I ain't never been 
But now, you're getting comfortable 
Ain't doing those things you did no more 
You're slowly making me pay for 
Things your money should be handling 
And now you ask to use my car 
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank 
And you have the audacity to even come and step to me 
Ask to hold some money from me until 
You get your check next week
You trifling 
(Good for nothing type of brother) 
Silly me 
(Why haven't I found another) 
(A baller), when times get hard need someone to help me out 
(Instead of) a scrub like you who don't know what a man's about
Can you pay my bills 
Can you pay my telephone bills 
Can you pay my automo-bills 
If you did then maybe we could chill 
I don't think you do 
So, you and me are through 
Can you pay my bills 
Can you pay my telephone bills 
Can you pay my automo-bills 
If you did then maybe we could chill 
I don't think you do 
So, you and me are through
Now you've been maxing out my cards 
Giving me bad credit buying me gifts with my 
Own ends 
Haven't paid the first bill 
But you're steady heading to the mall 
Going on shopping sprees perpetrating to your friends that you be balling 
And then you use my cell phone 
Calling whoever that you think at home 
And then when the bill comes all of a sudden you be acting dumb 
Don't know where none of these calls come from 
When your mama's number's here more than once
Can you pay my bills 
Can you pay my telephone bills 
Can you pay my automo-bills 
If you did then maybe we could chill 
I don't think you do 
So, you and me are through 
Can you pay my bills 
Can you pay my telephone bills 
Can you pay my automo-bills 
If you did then maybe we could chill 
I don't think you do 
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills 
Can you pay my telephone bills 
Can you pay my automo-bills 
If you did then maybe we could chill 
I don't think you do 
So, you and me are through 
Can you pay my bills 
Can you pay my telephone bills 
Can you pay my automo-bills 
If you did then maybe we could chill 
I don't think you do 
So, you and me are through

Lyrics:
Ladies leave your man at home 
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown 
And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends 
'Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'
Though he say he got a girl 
Yeah it's true you got a man 
But the party ain't gon' stop 
So let's make it hot, hot
Last weekend you stayed at home alone and lonely 
Couldn't find your man, he was chillin' with his homies 
This weekend you're going out 
If he try to to stop you, you're goin' off 
You got your hair done and your nails done too 
A new outfit and your Fendi shoes 
And when you're through parlayin' at the hottest spot 
Tonight you're gonna find the fellas 
Rollin' in the Lexus, drops and Hummers
Though he say he got a girl 
Yeah it's true you got a man 
But the party ain't gon' stop 
So let's make it hot, hot
Ladies leave your man at home 
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown 
And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends 
'Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'
Ladies leave your man at home 
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown 
And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends 
'Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'
Though he say he got a girl 
Yeah it's true you got a man 
But the party ain't gon' stop 
So let's make it hot, hot
Call your boys 'cause tonight you're not gonna stay at home 
Should tell your girl she ain't comin' tonight 
You're goin' solo 
Cut her off 'cause she talk some noise 
You know you got the right to get your party on 
So get your haircut and your car washed too 
Lookin' like a star in your Armani suit 
You need to look your best 'cause you're turnin' heads tonight 
You're gonna find a sexy chica that's gonna dance all night 
If you wanna
Though he say he got a girl 
Yeah it's true you got a man 
But the party ain't gon' stop 
So let's make it hot, hot
Ladies leave your man at home 
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown 
And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends 
'Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'
Ladies leave your man at home 
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown 
And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends 
'Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'
Sexy women do that dance 
Fly ladies work your man 
Balling fellas time to clown 
We can get down now
Bounce baby, bounce, bo-bounce bounce, bo-bounce 
Twerk it, twerk it 
Shake baby, shake sha-shake shake 
Work it, work it 
Twist baby, twist tw-twist 
You better dip that thing 
(One more time papi's mommies)
Bounce baby, bounce, bo-bounce bounce, bo-bounce 
Twerk it, twerk it 
Shake baby, shake sha-shake shake 
Work it, work it 
Twist baby, twist tw-twist 
You better dip that thing 
(Bounce it up and down papi's mommies)
Sexy women do that dance 
Fly ladies work your man 
Balling fellas time to clown 
We can get down now

Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyonc√©, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this
My boy Roc, can you handle this?
My girl Missy, can you handle this?
DC, can you handle this?
My ghettos, you can't handle this
Better move 'cause we've arrived
Lookin' sexy, lookin' fly
We're the baddest chicks, the chicks inside
DJ jam tonight
Spotted me, a tender thing, baby
There you are, come on, baby
Don't you wanna boogie with me
Say, can you handle, handle me?
You gotta do much better
If you gon' dance with me tonight
You gotta work yo jelly
If you gon' dance with me tonight
'Cause I don't think they're ready for that jelly from them boys
I don't think they're ready for that jelly from them boys
I don't think they're ready for that jelly
Beyonc√©, Michelle and Kelly
It's time for takeoff
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe
I shake my jelly at every chance
When I whip from my hips you slip into a trance
I'm hopin' you can handle all this jelly that I have
Now let's cut a rug while we shake our -
I'm about to break ya off
H-town growin' hard
Lead with hips, slap my thighs
Swing my hair, square my eyes
Lookin' hot, smellin' good
Groovin' like I'm from da hood
Look over my shoulder, I blow you a kiss
Can you handle, handle this?
You gotta do much better
If you gon' dance with me tonight (night)
You gotta work yo jelly
If you gon' dance with me tonight
Read my lips carefully if ya like what you see
Move girl, prove you can hang with me
By the looks I got ya shook up and scared of me
Buckle your seat belt, it's time for takeoff
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe
Y'all not ready
How many times I say y'all not ready
Watch my booty shake like a fat lady's belly
My style so stank I better bank you gon' smell me
Aw, you smell me
Smells like money when I come runnin', whoa
Missy keep it comin', whoa
RocWilder drum drummin'

Roc and Missy be hot like California
Won't you sing the hook, uh, why don'tcha
Now here we go
Move your body up and down
Make your booty touch the ground
I can't help but wonder why
Is my vibe too vibealicious for ya, babe?

Lyrics:
Can you keep up

Make me lose my breath
Bring the noise
Make me lose my breath
Hit me hard make
Me lose my breath (ah ah)
Can you keep up
Babyboy 
Make me lose my breath
Bring tha noise 
Make me lose my breath
Hit me hard 
Make me lose my breath (ah ah)
Ooo....
I put it right there made it easy for you to get too 
Now you act like you don't know what to do
After I done done everything that you asked me
Grabbed you 
Grind you 
Liked you 
Tried you 
Move so fast 
Baby now I can't find you
Ooo.... 
I'm startin believe that I'm way to much for you
All that talk but it seems like you can't come through
All them lines like you could satisfy
Now I see where believin you got me Gave you da wheel but you can't drive me
Ooo....
Two things I don't like when I'm tryin to get my groove
Is a partner that meets me halfway and jus can't prove
Take me out so deep and you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard and I need protection
So put it over here in the right direction
You understand the fact that I'm tryin to get to you
Ooo....
You movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue
didn't momma teach you to give affection
Learn the difference from a man and an adolescent 
It ain't you boo so get the steppin'
Can you keep up 
Babyboy
Make me lose my breath
Bring the noise
Make me lose my breath
Hit me hard make
Me lose my breath (ah ah)
Can you keep up
Babyboy 
Make me lose my breath
Bring tha noise 
Make me lose my breath
Hit me hard 
Make me lose my breath (ah ah)
Can you keep up 
Babyboy
Make me lose my breath
Bring the noise
Make me lose my breath
Hit me hard make
Me lose my breath (ah ah)
Can you keep up
Babyboy 
Make me lose my breath
Bring tha noise 
Make me lose my breath
Hit me hard 
Make me lose my breath (ah ah)
If you can't make me say ooo
Like the beat of this drum 
Why you ask for some and you ain't really want none
If you can't make me say ooo
Like the beat of this groove
All
You don't have no business in this here's your papers 
Baby you are dismissed
Can you keep up 
Babyboy
Make me lose my breath
Bring the noise
Make me lose my breath
Hit me hard make
Me lose my breath (ah ah)
Can you keep up
Babyboy 
Make me lose my breath

If your status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Betta be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things if you know what I mean
If your status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Betta be street if he looking at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me

Nunca Voy a Olvidarte (Primera Fila)[En Vivo] ft. Cristian Castro https://Bronco.lnk.to/NuncaOlvidarte

QUE NO QUEDE HUELLA

Esta canci√≥n que canto amigos
Es una m√°s de dolor
Si es que me ven llorando amigos
Disc√∫lpenme por favor

Traigo en el alma pena y llanto
Que no puedo contener
Y es que la quiero tanto y tanto
Pero me toco perder

Y ahora tengo que olvidarla tambi√©n
Y arrancarla de mi alma y mi ser
Y de aquel amor que quema mi piel
Que no quede nada

Que no quede huella que no y que no
Que no quede huella
Porque estoy seguro que tu mi amor
Ya ni me recuerdas

Que no quede huella que no y que no
Que no quede huella
Porque estoy seguro que tu mi amor
Ya ni me recuerdas

Que no quede huella de ti
Y de los besos que te di
Para convencerme mejor que yo
Ya te perd√≠

Ay!

Traigo en el alma pena y llanto
Que no puedo contener
Y es que la quiero tanto y tanto
Pero me toco perder

Y ahora tengo que olvidarla tambi√©n
Y arrancarla de mi alma y mi ser
Y de aquel amor que quema mi piel
Que no quede nada

Que no quede huella que no y que no
Que no quede huella
Porque estoy seguro que tu mi amor
Ya ni me recuerdas

Que no quede huella que no y que no
Que no quede huella
Porque estoy seguro que tu mi amor
Ya ni me recuerdas

Que no quede huella que no y que no

NUNCA VOY A OLVIDARTE

Junte lo mas hermoso 
que vivi yo contigo 
los detalles las cosas 
que me haran recordarte. 

Ahora voy a marcharme 
pues tu lo decidiste 
lo comprendo y me alejo 
no sin antes decirte. 

Que el tiempo que duro nuestro amor 
tu me hiciste feliz 
y en mi adios te deseo lo mejor. 

Pero este donde este 
nunca voy a olvidarte 
yo te juro que no tratare de olvidarte. 

Si no tienes amor 
para mi no me importa 
yo te quiero a morir 
sobre todas las cosas. 

Junte lo mas hermoso 
que vivi yo contigo 
los detalles las cosas 
que me haran recordarte. 

Ahora voy a marcharme

Letras:

Cuando digo que no quiero amarte mas 
es porque te amo
cuando digo que no quiero mas de ti
es por que te quiero
mas tengo miedo de entregar mi corazon
y confesar que ando toda entusiasmada
yo no puedo imaginar que va a ser de mi
si te perdiera un dia

veo mi paz que se desprende por doquier que despues te entrego
necesito hablar las cosas que yo se y despues me niego
y la verdad es que estoy loca ya por ti 
que tengo miedo de perderte alguna vez 
necesito aceptar que Dios jamas va a separarte de mi vida

Es una locura de decir que no te quiero 
evitar las apariencias ocultando evidencias 
mas porque seguir fingiendo sino puedo enga√±ar mi corazon
yo se que te amo
ya no mas mentiras si me muero de deseo
yo te quiero mas que a todo necesito de tu besos
le haces falta a mis dias 
mas sin ti no se que hacer que hacer sin ti 
yo quiero que conozcas mas de mi",True,True,49665655.0,pop music

Sin poder evitar,
Un lamento de amor, sin fin.

LETRA
Pensar que el tiempo paso y ella nunca volvio, 
dejo que el cielo se hiciera gris 
por dentro el se murio como se muere una flor 
y con la espera llego la edad y asi murio 

Con ilusiones marco su destino, pero no quiso escapar 
nunca se supo por quien lloraba el nunca quiso hablar 
hoy se preguntan con gran tristeza quien le arranco el corazon 
quien se ha llevado con su partida todo el valor de amar, de amar. 

Desde que solo quedo se le olvido sonreir 
y ahi en silencio espero, espero y asi murio 

Con ilusiones marco su destino, pero no quiso escapar 
nunca se supo por quien lloraba el nunca quiso hablar 
hoy se preguntan con gran tristeza quien le arranco el corazon 
quien se ha llevado con su partida todo el valor de amar.

Lyrics:
I'm sorry, so sorry
That I was such a fool
I didn't know
Love could be so cruel
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes
You tell me mistakes
Are part of being young
But that don't right
The wrong that's been done
I'm sorry
(So sorry) So sorry
Please accept my apology
But love is blind
And I was too blind to see
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes
You tell me mistakes
Are part of being young
But that don't right
The wrong that's been done
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes
I'm sorry, so sorry
Please accept my apology
But love was blind
And I was too blind to see (sorry)

Wockesha Remix (Ft. Ashanti and Lil Wayne) - Lyrics

Intro: Lil Wayne
Yeah I kinda put the cup down for a minute but um
But honestly it ain‚Äôt nobodies business what‚Äôs in my cup What‚Äôs in your cup, what‚Äôs in their cup
It‚Äôs your cup drink it
So whateva the hell was in my cup
The only reaction I did was got more popular
More successful did a lot more things that I‚Äôve ever done I probably should pick that cup back up
Verse 1: Lil Wayne
First thing first perc poppa
Drink always muddy
Flooded, crushed ice in the cup It look diamond studded
Slushy fucking codeine raw but I ain‚Äôt bussing
Throw her in the drink she throw me in park
And I ain‚Äôt budging ohh
Some say the lean makes the drink seem
Spectacular, Wockesha ain‚Äôt no activist but she can act like her Shivering I‚Äôm leaning pivoting
Chill, relax, fine let me pour up a line
MBY
 Wockesha Remix (Ft. Ashanti and Lil Wayne)
  Lyrics
 
Ring ring around the rosey
Leaning got me dozing
Wrap her body up in two cups keep her cozy
Fire I‚Äôm blowing like King Cooper Yoshi
Murder she wrote me with a purple emoji
Yeah
The days are just colder without her
Without that purple I‚Äôm blue the lakers just golden without her I don‚Äôt go nowhere without her hide in my soda Osama When it come to that wocka I got that hoe by her flocka Kesha
Hook
One minute I‚Äôm done with you the next one I be running back Go yo way I go my way but some how we be still attached Tryna found my answers with this cup but ain‚Äôt no truth in that They be like I‚Äôm dumb for fucking with you I spent stupid racks I‚Äôm sitting here knowing ion need ya pouring O‚Äôs in the lid Sipping chasers with my reefa, can‚Äôt get my mind off Wockesha Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings she my therapist I‚Äôma talk to this cup
Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo
I‚Äôm sitting here looking at Kiesha like do you love me do you love me not Damn you hit the spot
Taste like candy, sweet like fruit
Wet like water, can I love on you
Withdrawls I‚Äôm feeling different every day I need a dose
Every now and then I‚Äôm missing I got my times when I got ghost
But she mine, I‚Äôm stamping her, priority status so them other bitches mad at her (too mad, aha)
Coming through a hunnid thou
I spent that on times 2 on you
Called myself couldn‚Äôt get loose on you
Then I pop back up like peek-a-boo
Here I go, flyer than most Louis V coat
Gas station coffee cup full ion drive boats (nope)
Money can‚Äôt buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and something to eat that‚Äôs all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices of me weed
I‚Äôm displaying my feelings like I‚Äôm wearing them on my sleeves
Verse 3: Ashanti
Baby, why you hurt me, leave me and desert me
Boy, I gave you all my heart and all you did was tear it up
Looking out my window, knowing that I should go
Even when I pack my bags, there‚Äôs something always holding me back Ashanti
I ain‚Äôt with the running back
You can keep yo money bags

You be tryna trick on me sip on me cuz you want it back Babe, don‚Äôt play with my heart babe
I been in it with you from the start aye
Ain‚Äôt nobody there like I‚Äôm there for you to lean on Double cup love both got each other fiending
You better change yo habits
Cuz boy you fucking with a classic

Lyrics:
Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing
Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling ""You Hoo""
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go
Let's look at the snow
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with the song of a wintry fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop! Pop! Pop!

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

Lyrics:
Where do I begin
To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start

With her first hello
She gave new meaning to this empty world of mine
There'd never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely
With her around, who could be lonely
I reach for her hand-it's always there

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know I'll need her till the stars all burn away
And she'll be there

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know I'll need her till the stars all burn away
And she'll be there",True,True,24578157.0,pop music
