Lyrics:

Freal Luv (4x)

Know no limits, to feel the truth
When the world stops spinnin, 
I'll know it's you
Searching all night, like a spotlight
For the one to show
Could it be you, could it be me
Only way to know 

I'm all yours, when you really want to take me there
Don't let me go no where, 
I'd give it all up for you, I swear 
Only Freal luv
That love that keeps me shaking
So real there's no mistaking
I‚Äôd give it all up to you, I swear
Only Freal luv

Lovin that real luv, something you feel luv
Turning me back to the old me
Ride for my realla, I die for my realla
I give you respect like the OGs
Lockin me down like the police
We ain't never be lonely
Protectin‚Äô my love like a goalie, 
You'll be the only one next to me right with the homies
We got that empire mind, 
combine n‚Äô steadily rise (That be freal)
Moment of truth of has arrived, 
trust that forever you ride (That be freal)
You be the bank on my side, 
you supervise, Lets make a deal, 
Let's get it sealed let's make a trill, 
Let's rule the world, together freal

Freal Luv (4x)

I'm all yours, when you really want to take me there
Don't let me go no where, 
I'd give it all up for you, I swear 
Only Freal luv (2x)
That love that keeps me shaking
So real there's no mistaking
I‚Äôd give it all up to you, I swear
Only Freal luv

Love is a high, we feelin‚Äô alive, 
you Lovin‚Äô the size, Ïù¥ ÌùêÎ¶ÑÏùÑ ÌÉÄ
I give you more, you feelin‚Äô the flow, 
you never let none of them bring down the vibe
Hustle to win, we be livin‚Äô in sin, 
makin‚Äô us two of a kind
ÏÉàÎ°úÏö¥ Í∏∏, babe we got temples to build, 
ain't no haters can step to our grind
We got that empire mind,

Letra:
MC Paulin da Capital
Primeiramente um salve pra minha quebrada 
Jardim Tr√™s Marias s√≥ mlk louco 
Aqui tem artista, jogador e criminoso 
√â perto do Itaquera da Cohab, Barro Branco 
No Pacarana √© o quintal dos Corinthiano
X do Morro, Canga√≠ba, Caixa d‚Äô√Ågua 
Nesses peda√ßos a atividade √© dobrada
Na Tiradentes na trinta e na sorte
Os mulec√£o gosta de dar pinote
E no Pantanal s√≥ mano mil grau 
Vila Jacu√≠, Jardim Buriti, zona leste capital 

√â minha raiz (2x)

Fund√£o, cap√£o, zona sul no cora√ß√£o 
Norte, oeste, Zaki Narchi, Vila Ede 
E dessa eu n√£o me esque√ßo, saudades maloqueiro
Esquece fi, essa √© a quebrada do Kevin 

Refr√£o:
Progresso, vit√≥ria, sucesso 
O gueto foi o ber√ßo de onde eu vim 
Por isso eu represento 100% a quebrada onde eu nasci (2x)

MC Lipi 
Um salve salve pra todos maloqueiro 
E a humildade √© a chave dos verdadeiro 
Muitos n√£o sabem do nosso sofrimento 
Mas s√≥ entende quem sobrevive no gueto 

Da ponte pra c√° √© diferente a realidade √© diferente
V√°rios sonhador com sede de brilhar
Sobreviventes, v√°rios virou crente
Uns t√° no farol e outros preferiu roubar

Olha n√≥s olha quem diria, inspirando as periferia 
Deus pilotando a minha vida e eu pilotando as nave linda
Vou na paz sou gigante eu sou le√£o 
J√° errei j√° pequei mais pedi perd√£o 
Deus conhece quem tem um bom cora√ß√£o 
Vida longa aos bons 

Refr√£o (MC Paulin da Capital)
Progresso, vit√≥ria, sucesso 
O gueto foi o ber√ßo de onde eu vim 
Por isso eu represento 100% a quebrada onde eu nasci (2x)

MC Cabelinho 
Menor essa altura do campeonato n√≥s sabe quem ta mandado nos j√° sabe quem √© quem
Sem leme pra invejoso recalcado baba ovo do caralh* e ta de olho em que nos tem 

E essas mina acha que me engana todas elas explana 
E fica se enchendo de esperan√ßa por isso que n√£o tem minha confian√ßa meu caso com voc√™s n√£o e mais  
Nada al√©m da cama

A falsidade hoje em dia n√£o me surpreende 
V√°rios fala mal, mas nunca minha frente 
Tem coisa que acontece que n√≥s nunca entende
Chega ser engra√ßado me cr√≠tica e rende 

Um favelado de BM
Com pedras de brilhante na corrente 
Eu sei que incomoda muita gente 

Minha fam√≠lia bem melhor agora
M√£e, te amo muito minha vida pela senhora

Cabelinho vivendo tudo que sonhou 
Comprar tudo que quer sem perguntar valor 
Pode avisar a√≠
Que eu to daqui
Mais uma vez fazendo um feat in√©dito

Refr√£o (MC Paulin da Capital)
Progresso, vit√≥ria, sucesso 
O gueto foi o ber√ßo de onde eu vim 
Por isso eu represento 100% a quebrada onde eu nasci (2x)

Letra:

At√© posso morrer tentando
√â v√°rias fita, se eu contar, ningu√©m acredita
A senha que n√≥s digita, deixa um castelo no banco
Geral cogita que a rima que n√≥s recita, se p√° at√© desacredita que toca nos quatro canto

De Lamborghini, com a placa do ano,
N√≥is √© vitrine, virgulado no pano
N√£o subestime, eu t√¥ bolando um plano
Ent√£o sai da frente que o trem bala t√° passando

√â outro patamar
E hoje as nave decola, cole√ß√£o de doze mola pros favela desfilar
√â outro patamar
Sinto cheiro da vit√≥ria, misturado com a marola, hoje √© s√≥ fuma√ßa pro ar

Vejo o menor lutando por um futuro brilhante
Hoje maior eu vejo o som tocando nos falante
Sorriso da minha m√£e vale mais que um diamante
E a foto dos menor deixei de quadro na estante

Todos mano lucrando ao meu redor
Hoje t√° quase tudo bem, s√≥ faltou quem se foi pra ta melhor
Nunca vou me render pra ningu√©m
Minha garganta quase deu um n√≥
Quando vi minha m√£e chorar no trem
Panela vazia mas tinha alegria, hoje a gente vai comer o que tem

Escuta ronco da jaguar
√â sinal que ta vindo o s√≥cio duplicar
Nessa baga√ßa, turismo de gra√ßa
Pra ver playboy sem voz e a favela que vai cantar

√â outro patamar
E hoje as nave decola, cole√ß√£o de doze mola pros favela desfilar
√â outro patamar
Sente cheiro da vit√≥ria, misturado com a marola, hoje √© s√≥ fuma√ßa pro ar

Enquanto essa guerra excita, √© mil fita, n√≥is transita pelas rua de tagu√°
Pros capa √© s√≥ linha na pipa, √© cortar e aparar
Eu vou puxar s√≥ pela rabiola
Vai ter que admitir que o cerol da favela √© foda

Que corta o preconceito, preto tamb√©m tem respeito
Vim l√° do gueto e j√° to pronto pra voar
Traz o dinheiro que hoje eu vou queimar com o isqueiro
S√≥ acendo esse paiero agora em outro lugar

At√© posso morrer tentando
√â v√°rias fita, se eu contar, ningu√©m acredita
A senha que n√≥s digita, deixa um castelo no banco
Geral cogita que a rima que n√≥s recita, se p√° at√© desacredita que toca nos quatro canto

De Lamborghini, com a placa do ano,
N√≥is √© vitrine, virgulado no pano
N√£o subestime, eu t√¥ bolando um plano
Ent√£o sai da frente que o trem bala t√° passando

√â outro patamar
E hoje as nave decola, cole√ß√£o de doze mola pros favela desfilar
√â outro patamar
Sente cheiro da vit√≥ria, misturado com a marola, hoje √© s√≥ fuma√ßa pro ar",True,True,15450532.0,Not Found

Letra:
Apontei pro c√©u, na esperan√ßa do dia chegar
Escrevi no papel que a minha estrela um dia vai brilhar
Vi minha m√£e chorar por n√£o ter uma condi√ß√£o melhor
Meu pai se esfor√ßar com determina√ß√£o e suor

Vou ser campe√£o, mostrar pro mund√£o quem que sou eu
Sou motiva√ß√£o e a supera√ß√£o pra quem sofreu, 
Quero o torped√£o com a sensa√ß√£o de saber que √© meu
Vou nessa miss√£o e aqueles que duvido, correu

V√°rios olhou no meu fracasso, poucos colou pra dar uma abra√ßo 
Esses eu nunca deixei de lembrar (n√£o deixei de lembrar)
E quando eu me perdi no lago, vi v√°rios pular do barco
E mesmo assim n√£o deixei de remar

√â s√≥ ter p√© no ch√£o, s√≥ ter f√© e andar com Deus 
Que a vez dele chegou, pode p√° o pr√≥ximo √© eu 

√â s√≥ ter p√© no ch√£o, s√≥ ter f√© e andar com Deus
Um brinde aos merecedor, os menor ral√© venceu (2x)

S√≥ pra retificar
Dj Guh Mix, pode anotar

Anota a√≠, que nois vai ser campe√£o
Pode rir, mas n√£o desacredita n√£o 
Vou conseguir com humildade e p√© no ch√£o 
Sair comemorando e fazer festa no morr√£o

Eu sou sujeito homem, inspira√ß√£o pra molecada 
Nois faz por onde seja qual for a caminhada 
Eu vou fazer o meu nome sem pegar numa quadrada 
E ser mais um espelho para as quebradas 

Quero ficar rico logo esse ano 
Quero poder ajudar a minha comunidade
Ver o sonho dos pivetes se realizando 
E os menor tumultuando com as carenagens 

Quero dar uma melhora l√° pro meu coroa
Ver a minha m√£e milion√°ria e nunca mais trampar
Queria mesmo ver os trutas que se foi 
E que esteja em um bom lugar

Pra sempre vai ficar nas memorias 
Meu peito chora s√≥ de lembrar
Uma viagem sem volta 
Um dia nois vai se trombar

Saudade que bate de uns amigos que n√£o v√£o mais voltar
Mas um dia nois se tromba
V√°rios na maldade s√≥ pe√ßo que deus venha me guiar 
E livrai-me dos pilantras  

S√≥ pra retificar
Dj Guh Mix, pode anotar

LETRA

[Refr√£o: MC Lipi]
Olha os menor de trator, olha os menor de trator
S√≥ o cano, s√≥ pra fazer barulh√£o
Enchi o tanque, ele gritou, oh
Todas ela no show
Sente a vibe e a brisa do flow
Entrei em campo agora e j√° fiz o gol
Entrei em campo agora e j√° fiz o gol
Yeah

[Verso 1: MC Lipi]
Eles quer falar de mim
Eles t√™m muita inveja de mim
Tu n√£o sabe nem um ter√ßo do que eu vivi
N√£o sofreu nem a metade que eu sofri
Ent√£o pode falar, deixa eles falar
De ond–µ eu t√¥ nem d√° pra escutar
T√¥ nas altura, y–µah
No meu jato particular
Aham, √≥, ahn
Mund√£o capotou e saquei a Macan, ahn, ahn
Criticava e hoje fala que √© meu f√£, ahn, ahn
Congelado, mano, eu t√¥ em Amsterd√£, ahn, ahn
Amsterd√£, ahn, ahn
Olha os ral√© da quebrada
T√° no topo com a vida mudada, n√©?
√â, hoje n√≥s s√≥ d√° risada
E o sofrimento que n√≥s j√° passou, yeah
Eu jamais esqueci da de f√© que sempre correu por mim
E hoje todo trajado de Nike
E ela m√≥ chave de Loui' V, √©
Eu vim de um lugar que se tu v√™, tu vai chorar de d√≥
Onde eu senti frio, senti minha barriga dando n√≥
Vi v√°rios amigos se perdendo na porra do p√≥
E eu na esperan√ßa de ver minha m√£e numa goma melhor
Woah
Hoje eu t√¥ bem melhor
Woah
Hoje eu t√¥ bem melhor
Woah
Hoje eu t√¥ bem melhor
Woah
Hoje eu t√¥ bem melhor

[Verso 2: MC Hariel]
Olha os menor promissor
'C√™ pensou que era infrator
T√° impressionada com o Lipi de nav√£o
Tem que ver o que o GM lan√ßou
Paga √† vista e cancela a presta√ß√£o
Hasta la vista, pra recalcado √© show
T√¥ em campo e √© s√≥ de apresenta√ß√£o
Tipo perigo iminente de gol, yeah
E nem a baga
Eu vou deixar pra invejoso camuflado que tenta colar do lado, mas
Eu fiz minha cota e guardei bem na minha mem√≥ria
Quem tava na pior fase pra n√£o me ludibriar, mas
'C√™s t√™m dinheiro, 'c√™s t√™m a roupa da moda
S√≥ que pra colar do lado ainda
N√≥s t√° bem mais que acostumado com destaque
T√° causando um piripaque a cada linha que o bonde mandar
De Polished
D√≥lar na mesa equivale o que pingou na conta enquanto n√≥s transverte
Pensa quantas recusou de vestir a camisa e pegar no rev√≥lver
Como sempre liberdade aos amigo de inf√¢ncia, o bonde dos moleque
Deixa acreditar na sorte
[?] t√° bem calibrado
Eu t√¥ de McLaren s√≥ cortando o vento
As carenagem toda aprimorada
Pique extravagante que nem meu talento
As tatuagem √© a placa berrada
Esse √© cantor de funk n√£o tem argumento
Pra contestar que a nossa vit√≥ria foi feita no merecimento, √≥

[Sa√≠da: MC Hariel]
Diretamente, Studios Love Funk
√â o Lipi, √© o Haridade
2-0-2-1
Pega a vis√£o, √≥

Lyrics:

All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am
But these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true... I was made for you

I climbed across the mountain tops
Swam all across the ocean blue
I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules
But baby I broke them all for you
Because even when I was flat broke
You made me feel like a million bucks
You do and I was made for you

Lyrics:
They build wooden houses on frozen ponds
In the summertime when the water's gone
Diagonal lines in their rolled-out lawns
And the sage always smells so pretty
But nobody cares where the birds have gone
When the rain comes down on Babylon
The stone mason's phone rings all day long
And you gotta get back to the city

I'll build my house up on this rock, baby
Every day with you
There's nothin' in that town I need
After everything we've been through
Me out in my garden and you out on your walk
Is all the distance this poor girl can take
Without listenin' to you talk
I don't need their money, baby
Just you and me on the rock
You and me on the rock

I built paper planes when I learned to fly
Like a 747 fallin' out of the sky
I folded 'em crooked, now I'm wonderin' why
I could always end up in the water
But nobody's askin' why she lookin' so thin
Why she laughin' too hard or why she drinkin' again
A fallen star, she's a paper plane
She was goin' down when you caught her

I'll build my house up on this rock, baby
Every day with you
There's nothin' in that town I need
After everything we've been through
Me out in my garden and you out on your walk
Is all the distance this poor girl can take
Without listenin' to you talk
I don't need their money, baby
Just you and me on the rock

It's an earthquake, it's a harder wind
It's a record breakin' tide and it is rollin' in
It's a big sea, but it can't touch you and me
It's just not water for you
And what are you?
I don't need their money, baby
Woo

I'll build my house up on this rock, baby
Every day with you
There's nothin' in that town I need
After everything we've been through
Me out in my garden and you out on your walk
Is all the distance this old girl can take
Without listenin' to you talk
I don't need their money, baby
Just you and me on the rock

I don't need their money, baby (I don't need their money, baby)
Just you and me on the rock (Just you and me on the rock)
You and me on the rock",True,True,15856821.0,folk rock

Lyrics: 
You're feeling nervous, aren't you, boy?
With your quiet voice and impeccable style
Don't ever let them steal your joy
And your gentle ways
To keep 'em from running wild
They can kick dirt in your face
Dress you down, and tell you that your place
Is in the middle, when they hate the way you shine
I see you tugging on your shirt
Trying to hide inside of it
And hide how much it hurts
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them
You get discouraged, don't you, girl?
It's your brother's world for a while longer
We gotta dance with the devil on a river
To beat the stream
Call it living the dream, call it kicking the ladder
They come to kick dirt in your face
To call you weak and then displace you
After carrying your baby on your back across the desert
I saw your eyes behind your hair
And you're looking tired, but you don't look scared
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Lirik :

Kau tak sepenuhnya sendiri
Aku kan s'lalu ada disini
Mengapa oh mengapa dirimu
Penuh dengan rasa bimbang

Tak perlu kau pergi tuk mencari
Mencari arti cinta

Aku sendiri di sini menunggu
Aku sendiri di sini menanti
Aku tak terbiasa untuk berharap
Berlari untuk mengejar dirimu
Dalam menggapai semua impiku
S'moga kau kan tetap jadi
Apa yang ku inginkan

Mengapa oh mengapa dirimu
Penuh dengan rasa bimbang

Jangan pernah berubag
Ingat janjimu
Jangan pernah menghilang
Dari hatiku

Lirik :

Ku tak percaya kau ada disini 
Menemaniku... disaat dia pergi 
Sungguh bahagia kau ada disini 
Menghapus semua...
Sakit yang kurasa

Mungkinkah kau merasakan 
Semua yang kupasrahkan 
Kenanglah kasih..

Kusuka dirinya mungkin
Aku sayang 
Namun apakah mungkin
Kau menjadi milikku
Kau pernah menjadi
Menjadi miliknya
Namun salahkah aku
Bila kupendam rasa ini

Lyrics:
Every time you come around you know I can‚Äôt say no 
Every time the sun goes down I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
and tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last, but it probably won‚Äôt
I‚Äôve got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was looking for a way out, now I can‚Äôt escape 
Nothing happens after two
It‚Äôs true it‚Äôs true
My bad habits lead to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Falling over everything to reach the first times spark
Started under neon lights then it all got dark 
I only know how to go too far 

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last, but it probably won‚Äôt
I‚Äôve got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was looking for a way out, now I can‚Äôt escape 
Nothing happens after two
It‚Äôs true it‚Äôs true
My bad habits lead to you

We took the long way round
And burned til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last, but it probably won‚Äôt
I‚Äôve got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was looking for a way out, now I can‚Äôt escape 
Nothing happens after two
It‚Äôs true it‚Äôs true
My bad habits lead to you

Lyrics:
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then something more
Oh yeah I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine we can drive real far
Go dancing underneath the stars
Oh yeah I want it all 

You got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I
Like my souls on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah you got me feeling like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you‚Äôre close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby you wanna dance ‚Äòtil the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party‚Äôs over then we‚Äôll bring it right back
And we‚Äôll say
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you‚Äôre close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby you wanna dance ‚Äòtil the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party‚Äôs over then we‚Äôll bring it right back
Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
 Oh I can‚Äôt get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and break my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Oh I can‚Äôt get enough

You got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I
Like my souls on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah you got me feeling like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you‚Äôre close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby you wanna dance ‚Äòtil the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party‚Äôs over then we‚Äôll bring it right back
And we‚Äôll say ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you‚Äôre close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby you wanna dance ‚Äòtil the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party‚Äôs over then we‚Äôll bring it right back

Baby you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started I don‚Äôt want it to stop, you know you make me shiver
Yeah you got me singing like 

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you‚Äôre close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby you wanna dance ‚Äòtil the sunlight cracks

-- | LYRICS |--

The club isn‚Äôt the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go 
Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow
you come over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I‚Äôll give it a chance now
Take my hand stop, put van the man on the jukebox and then we start to dance
And now I‚Äôm singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don‚Äôt mind me 
Say boy let‚Äôs not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I‚Äôm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I‚Äôm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new
I‚Äôm in love with your body

Oh I X 4
I‚Äôm in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I‚Äôm in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I‚Äôm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I‚Äôm in love with the shape of you 

One week in we let the story begin
We‚Äôre going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat 
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family‚Äôs doing ok
leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
and I'm singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead 
I may be crazy, don‚Äôt mind me
Say boy let‚Äôs not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I‚Äôm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I‚Äôm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Well I‚Äôm in love with your body
Oh I x 4 
I‚Äôm in love with your body
Oh I x 4
I‚Äôm in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I‚Äôm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I‚Äôm in love with the shape of you 

Come on be my baby come on X 8

I‚Äôm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I‚Äôm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Well I‚Äôm in love with your body
Come on be my baby come on X 6
Every day discovering something brand new
I‚Äôm in love with the shape of you

Lyrics:
I wanna be in your life until the night is over 
I want to hold you so tight 
So tight come in closer 
It‚Äôs been a hell of a ride 
For every single moment 
You were there by my side 
Whenever I‚Äôm broken you make me feel whole 
Whenever I‚Äôm lonely you there for my soul
Wherever you are girl that‚Äôs where I call my home 
Whenever you doubt it I‚Äôll be letting you know 
Ohhh
Girl I want to be dancing with you forever
You see through the storm and take me as I am 
Baby it‚Äôs magic anytime that we‚Äôre together 
I make I just love you hold you for my hand
Hold you for my hand, my hand, hand hand 
Hold you for my hand
Hold you for my hand
Oh I‚Äôm alone again
Hear my love is burning baby feels like time is frozen babe
The night is for us
I feel alone again 
Every moment is calling ye
Feelings I been holding in
It must be love 
Whenever I‚Äôm broken you make me feel whole 
Whenever I‚Äôm lonely you there for my soul
Wherever you are girl that‚Äôs where I call my home 
Whenever you down here I‚Äôll be letting you know 
Ohhh
Girl I want to be dancing with you forever
You see through the storm and take me as I am 
Baby it‚Äôs magic anytime that we‚Äôre together 
I make I just love you hold you for my hand
Hold you for my hand, hand hand 
Hold you for my hand
Hold you for my hand
Hold you for my hand, hand hand 
Hold you for my hand
Hold you for my hand
I wanna be in your life until the night is over

LYRICS
Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can‚Äôt get you off my mind
Off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times
Million times 
Oh whoa 
Why can‚Äôt you, why can‚Äôt you 
Just let me go 

Strung out on a feeling 
My hands are tied
Your face on my ceiling
I fantasize
Oh I can‚Äôt control it, I can‚Äôt control it 

I try to replace it
With city lights
I‚Äôll never escape it
I need the high
Oh I can‚Äôt control it, I can‚Äôt control it 

You keep making it harder to stay 
But I still can‚Äôt run away 
I gotta know why can‚Äôt you 
Why can‚Äôt you 
Just let me go 

Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can‚Äôt get you off my mind
Off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times
Million times 
Oh whoa 
Why can‚Äôt you, why can‚Äôt you 
Just let me go 

Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can‚Äôt get you off my mind
Off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times
Million times 
Oh whoa 
Why can‚Äôt you, why can‚Äôt you 
Just let me go 

I tasted heaven now I can‚Äôt live without it
I can‚Äôt forget you and your love is the loudest
Oh I can‚Äôt control it, I can‚Äôt control it 

You keep making it harder to stay 
Oh whoa
But I still can‚Äôt run away 
I gotta know why can‚Äôt you 
Why can‚Äôt you 
Just let me go 

Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can‚Äôt get you off my mind
Off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times
Million times 
Oh whoa 
Why can‚Äôt you, why can‚Äôt you 
Just let me go 

Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can‚Äôt get you off my mind
Off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times
Million times 
Oh whoa 
Why can‚Äôt you, why can‚Äôt you 
Just let me go 

Prisoner
Can‚Äôt get you off my mind
Why can‚Äôt you just let me go
Million times
I wanna know why can‚Äôt you 
Why can‚Äôt you 
I wanna know why can‚Äôt you

Lyrics:

We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell.
A love no onecould deny

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me""",True,True,691252064.0,pop music

LYRICS
Flowers in hand, waiting for me 
Every word in poetry 
Won‚Äôt call me by name, only baby 
The more that you give the less that I 
Need everyone says I look happy 
When it feels right

I know that you‚Äôre wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees 
‚ÄòCause they say that misery loves company 
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it‚Äôs not you‚Äôre fault I can‚Äôt be what you need
Baby 
Angels like you can‚Äôt fly down here with me 
I‚Äôm everything they said I would be

(La La la)
I‚Äôm everything they said I would be

I‚Äôll put you down slow
Love you goodbye 
before you let go, just one more time
Take off you‚Äôre clothes
pretend that it‚Äôs fine
A little more hurt won‚Äôt kill you 
tonight mama says you don‚Äôt look happy 
Close your eyes 

I know that you‚Äôre wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees 
‚ÄòCause they say that misery loves company 
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it‚Äôs not you‚Äôre fault I can‚Äôt be what you need
Baby 
Angels like you can‚Äôt fly down here with me 
I‚Äôm everything they said I would be

I know that you‚Äôre wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees 
‚ÄòCause they say that misery loves company 
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it‚Äôs not you‚Äôre fault I can‚Äôt be what you need
Baby 
Angels like you can‚Äôt fly down here with me 
I‚Äôm everything they said I would be

LYRICS:

La la la la la

Yeah it‚Äôs been a long night and the mirror‚Äôs telling me to go home
But it‚Äôs been a long time since I felt this good on my own
A lot of years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes
Forever, and ever, no more

The midnight sky is the road I‚Äôm taking
Head high up in the clouds
Ohhhh

I was born to run I don‚Äôt belong to anyone, oh no
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
Fire in my lungs can‚Äôt bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
See my lips, on her mouth, everybody‚Äôs talking now baby
Ohh, you know it‚Äôs true, yeahh
That I was born to run I don‚Äôt belong to anyone, oh no
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
Loved by you‚Ä¶.

La la la la la

She got her hair pulled back cause the sweat‚Äôs dripping off of her face
Said it ain‚Äôt so bad if I wanna make a couple mistakes
You should know right now that I never stay put in one place
Forever, and ever, no more

The midnight sky is the road I‚Äôm taking
Head high up in the clouds
Ohhhh

I was born to run I don‚Äôt belong to anyone, oh no
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
Fire in my lungs can‚Äôt bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
See my lips, on her mouth, everybody‚Äôs talking now baby
Ohh, you know it‚Äôs true, yeahhh
That I was born to run I don‚Äôt belong to anyone, oh no
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
By you‚Ä¶.

Ohhh

I don‚Äôt hide, blurry eyes like you
Like you

I was born to run I don‚Äôt belong to anyone, oh no
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
Fire in my lungs can‚Äôt bite the devil on my tongue, you know
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
See his hands round my waist, thought you‚Äôd never be replaced baby
Ohh you know it‚Äôs true, yeah

That I was born to run I don‚Äôt belong to anyone, oh no
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you

Yeah‚Ä¶

[Verse 1]
When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound

As the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer

Lyrics

Look at what you've done
Stand still, fallin' away from me
When it takes so long
Fire's out, what do you want to be?

I'm holdin' on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now, every other day I'll be watching you

Oh oh
Oh oh
Show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
Oh oh
We did everything right, now I'm on the outside

I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like

Though you give me no reason
For me to stay close to you
Tell me what lovers do
How are we still breathing?
It's never for us to choose
I'll be the strength in you

I'm holdin' on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now, every other day I'll be watching you

Oh oh
Oh oh
Show you what it feels like

‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm not here to make friends

Thirty almost got me and I‚Äôm so over love songs, yeah

So if you want it bad tonight
Come by me and drop a line

Don‚Äôt be scared if you like it

Calvin Harris - My Way (Lyrics)

Why wait 
To say
At least I did it my way 
Lie awake 
Two faced 
But in my heart I understand 
I made 
My move 
And it was all about you 
Now I feel 
So far removed 

You were the one thing in my way 

My way
Away away away""",True,True,830392892.0,popular music

Lyrics

I want you to breathe me in
Let me be your air
Let me roam your body freely
No inhibition, no fear

How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
What devotion are you?
How deep is your love?
Is it like Nirvana?
Hit me harder again
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
Pull me closer again
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love?

Open up my eyes and
Tell me who I am
Let me in on all your secrets
No inhibition, no sin

How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
What devotion are you?
How deep is your love?
Is it like Nirvana?
Hit me harder again
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
Pull me closer again
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love?

How deep is your love?
So tell me, how deep is your love? Can it go deeper?
So tell me, how deep is your love? Can it go deep?
So tell me, how deep is your love? Can it go deeper?
So tell me, how deep is your love? Can it go deep?

How deep is your love?
So tell me, how deep is your love? Can it go deeper?
So tell me, how deep is your love? Can it go deep?

How deep is your love?
So tell me, how deep is your love? Can it go deeper?
Pull me closer again (so tell me, how deep is your love?)
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love?

How deep is your love?
So tell me, how deep is your love? Can it go deeper?
So tell me, how deep is your love? Can it go deep?

How deep is your love?

‚ñ∫Lyrics:
Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I‚Äôve ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices, they come with prices and vices, I end up in crisis
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming one day I‚Äôll watch as you‚Äôre leaving ‚Äòcause you got tired of my scheming - for the last time

It‚Äôs me
Hi
I‚Äôm the problem, it‚Äôs me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I‚Äôll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I‚Äôm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman 
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming 
one day I‚Äôll watch as you‚Äôre leaving and life will lose all its meaning - for the last time 

It‚Äôs me
Hi
I‚Äôm the problem, it‚Äôs me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I‚Äôll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers ‚Äòround and reads it
And then someone screams out
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs laughing up at us from hell!‚Äù

It‚Äôs me
Hi
I‚Äôm the problem, it‚Äôs me

It‚Äôs me
Hi
I‚Äôm the problem, it‚Äôs me

It‚Äôs me
Hi

Everybody agrees
Everybody agrees

It‚Äôs me
Hi
I‚Äôm the problem, it‚Äôs me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I‚Äôll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sam Dew

Meet me at midnight ...
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don‚Äôt ever say too much
And you don‚Äôt really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny
You handle it beautifully
All this shit is new to me
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I‚Äôm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
All they keep asking me
Is if I‚Äôm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see
Is a one night or a wife
I find it dizzying
They‚Äôre bringing up my history
But you weren‚Äôt even listening
Chorus
That lavender haze
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
Chorus
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

‚ñ∫Lyrics:
Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight ‚Ä¶

My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart ‚Äòcause he was nice

He was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight ‚Ä¶

It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him it‚Äôs every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away

Cause he was sunshine 
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight


He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

I guess sometimes we all get
just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except when I‚Äôm on TV
I guess sometimes we all get 
some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this ‚Ä¶

Official ‚Äòcardigan‚Äô Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Aaron Dessner

Vintage tee, brand new phone High heels on cobblestones
When you are young they assume you know nothing Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young they assume you know nothing

But I knew you Dancing in your Levi‚Äôs
Drunk under a streetlight I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt Baby kiss it better
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone‚Äôs bed You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and Giving me your weekends I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line Once in twenty lifetimes
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone‚Äôs bed You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars But now I‚Äôm bleeding

Cause I knew you Stepping on the last train
 
Marked me like a bloodstain I knew you
Tried to change the ending Peter losing Wendy
I knew you
Leaving like a father Running like water
When you are young they assume you know nothing But I knew you‚Äôd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you‚Äôd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I‚Äôd curse you for the longest time Chasing shadows in the grocery line
I knew you‚Äôd miss me once the thrill expired And you‚Äôd be standing in my front porch light And I knew you‚Äôd come back to me
You‚Äôd come back to me And you‚Äôd come back to me And you‚Äôd come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan Under someone‚Äôs bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

‚ÄòTil January
This is our place, we make the rules 
And there‚Äôs a dazzling haze
A mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close? 
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You‚Äôre my, my, my, my... 
Lover
We could let our friends crash 
In the living room
This is our place, we make the call 
And I‚Äôm highly suspicious
That everyone who sees you wants you 
I‚Äôve loved you 3 summers now, honey 
But I want them all
Chorus
Ladies and gentlemen
Will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand 
I take this magnetic force of a man
To be my lover
My heart‚Äôs been borrowed 
And yours has been blue 
All‚Äôs well that ends well 
To end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true 
To my lover
And you‚Äôll save all your dirtiest jokes 
For me
And at every table, I‚Äôll save you a seat 
Lover...
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You‚Äôre my, my, my, my... 
Oh you‚Äôre my, my, my, my... 
Darling you‚Äôre my, my, my, my...
Lover

‚ñ∫Lyrics:
Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

Summer went away
Still the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently
He‚Äôs gonna notice me
It‚Äôs ok, we‚Äôre the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice
You‚Äôre smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it‚Äôs your face
I didn‚Äôt choose this town
I dream of getting out
There‚Äôs just one who could make me stay
All my days

From sprinkler splashes
To fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party
Of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared
You‚Äôre on your own, kid
You always have been

I see the great escape
So long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed
Writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I‚Äôll run away

From sprinkler splashes 
To fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party
Of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren‚Äôt rare
You‚Äôre on your own, kid
You always have been

From sprinkler splashes 
To fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I‚Äôd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren‚Äôt funny
I took the money
My friends from home don‚Äôt know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can‚Äôt take away
Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So make the friendship bracelets
Take the moment and taste it
You‚Äôve got no reason to be afraid
You‚Äôre on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You‚Äôre on your own, kid
You always have been

‚ñ∫Lyrics:
Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

Baby love, I think I‚Äôve been a little too kind
Didn‚Äôt notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Putting someone first only works
When you‚Äôre in their top 5
And by the way
I‚Äôm going out tonight

Best believe I‚Äôm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ‚ÄúDo you have a man?‚Äù
I could still say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember‚Äù
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don‚Äôt put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real
I polish up real nice
NICE!

Baby boy, I think I‚Äôve been too good of a girl 
Too good of a girl
Did all the extra credit then got graded on a curve
I think it‚Äôs time to teach some lessons
I made you my world
Have you heard
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you
But I miss sparkling ‚Ä¶

Chorus

Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura‚Äôs moonstone
Just ‚Äòcause he was high
And we‚Äôre dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What‚Äôs a girl gonna do?
A diamond‚Äôs gotta shine

Chorus
And we‚Äôre dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What‚Äôs a girl gonna do?
What‚Äôs a girl gonna do? 
I polish up nice
Best believe I‚Äôm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer

#Future #MaskOff #MollyPercocet

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Call it how it is (Call it how it is)
Hendrix
I promise, I swear, I swear
You heard, spit it, yo

[Chorus]
Percocets (Ya), molly, Percocets (Percocets)
Percocets (Ya), molly, Percocets (Percocets)
Rep the set (Yee), gotta rep the set (Gang, gang)
Chase a check (Chase it), never chase a bitch (Don't chase no bitches)
Mask on (Off), fuck it, mask off (Mask)
Mask on (Off), fuck it, mask off (Mask)
Percocets ('Cets), molly, Percocets (Percocets)
Chase a check (Chase it), never chase a bitch (Don't chase no bitches)

[Verse 1]
Two cups (Cup), toast up with the gang (Gang, gang)
From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain, ya
Out the bottom (Ye), I'm the livin' proof (Super)
Ain't compromisin' (Woah), half a million on the coupe (Gang, gang)
Drug houses (where), lookin' like Peru (Woah, woah, woah)
Graduated (Crazy), I was overdue (I'm on due)
Pink molly (Molly), I can barely move (Barely move)
Ask about me ('Bout me), I'm gon' bust a move
Rick James (James), thirty-three chains (Thirty-three)
Ocean air (Air), cruisin' Biscayne
Top off (Ya), that‚Äôs a liability (Big foreigns)
Hit the gas (Gas), boostin' my adrenaline (Big foreigns)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ford or Maybach (Ford or), I drive anything (Ye)
Buy my Range (Ye), make 'em go insane (Ye)
(Oh my Lord, praise him be)
My guillotine, drank promethazine (Drank prometh')
TEC and beams (Ya), go to those extremes (Let's go, let's go)
Parliament (Parliament), calamari Wednesday (Ya)
Parlay in Vegas, we was in attendance (What's good, what's good)
Before the business (Yeah), Theodore lenses
Theo-Dur prescriptions (Ya), focus on the missions (Fo' my)
Intermission (Hol' up), never take a break (We can pull up)
Switch states, touch down, foreign plates (Speech)
Ain't no way, ain't no fuckin' way (No)
We call the play, we didn't come to play (No)
Rob the bank, we gon' rob the game (Gang)
They gang, we gang (Gang)
But they are not the same (Freebandz)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Gas gone, never nod off
(Cold chills, prison cells)

Letra

Cantinero mil disculpas 
Perdone que le interrumpa
Pero quiero, sacarme del pecho
S√© que no soy el primero 
Que le viene con el cuento
De que el coraz√≥n en mil se lo partieron 

Hablemos de la culpable 
Que hizo algo imperdonable
Esa que duerme tranquila 
Despu√©s de tantas mentiras
C√≥mo fue capaz de decir que me amaba 
Y cambiarme por otro como si nada 

Me dijo que como a ning√∫n otro me amar√≠a 
Y que ella sin m√≠ se morir√≠a 
Y la cabrona sigue viva todav√≠a 

Y yo le dije que si se iba no me doler√≠a 
Y que r√°pido la olvidar√≠a
Yo pensando que me rogar√≠a 
Pero la sinverg√ºenza se dio la media vuelta
Y no ha vuelto todav√≠a

√âchele compa Christian
Ajajayy dolor, Christian Nodal 
Y puro MS viejo jajayyyy

Me dijo que como a ning√∫n otro me amar√≠a 
Y que ella sin m√≠ se morir√≠a 
Y la cabrona sigue viva todav√≠a 

Y yo le dije que si se iba no me doler√≠a 
Y que r√°pido la olvidar√≠a
Yo pensando que me rogar√≠a 
Pero la sinverg√ºenza se dio la media vuelta
Y no ha vuelto todav√≠a

Letra

¬øY qu√© tal si funciona?
No perdemos nada
¬øQu√© tal si te arriesgas
Y soy la persona que tanto esperabas?

¬øQu√© tal si lo tuyo
Se vuelve lo nuestro?
¬øQu√© tal si mejor nos quitamos la duda
Con un par de besos?

¬øPor qu√© no intentarlo
Si los dos queremos?

¬øY qu√© tal si funciona
Y nos sonr√≠e el amor?

Si vale la pena
Por m√≠ no hay problema
Dar el coraz√≥n 

Y enamorase otra vez
Como la primera vez

¬øY qu√© tal si funciona
Lo que siempre quisimos?
No pienses que es tarde
Yo quiero quedarme una vida contigo

Dame una respuesta
¬øQu√© tal si te arriesgas a ser feliz conmigo?

Qu√© honor que estemos juntos otra vez
Es un placer para nosotros
Coincidir contigo de nueva cuenta, Yuridia
¬°Y las que faltan!
¬°Much√≠simas gracias!

¬øY qu√© tal si funciona
Y nos sonr√≠e el amor?
Si vale la pena
Por m√≠ no hay problema
Dar el coraz√≥n

Y enamorase otra vez
Como la primera vez

¬øY qu√© tal si funciona
Lo que siempre quisimos?
No pienses que es tarde
Yo quiero quedarme una vida contigo

Dame una respuesta
¬øQu√© tal si te arriesgas a ser feliz conmigo?

LYRICS
Soy del 141 y aqu√≠ voy
Tras Las Almas del cartel saben que estoy
Vamos fuertes los vaqueros, s√≠ se√±or
Gaz, al cuidado del equipo y los dem√°s
Y el fantasma nadie sabe d√≥nde est√°
Hace guerra para conseguir la paz
Mi Capit√°n, te paso un puro
Tienes todo mi respeto
Siempre has sido el tipo duro
Por eso me comprometo

A luchar por el equipo
Se prendieron las alarmas
Pelot√≥n estamos listos
Les vamos a dar su karma
Oye Soap, te necesito
Tu experiencia nos respalda
Pobres de mis enemigos
Ya lleg√≥ Alejandro Vargas
Somos 141, as√≠ nomas
Porque cada vez los buenos somos m√°s (X2)

On a hillside desolate 
Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car 
This charming man
Why pamper life's complexity 
When the leather runs smooth 
On the passenger's seat?
I would go out tonight 
But I haven't got a stitch to wear 
This man said ""it's gruesome 
That someone so handsome should care""
Ah ! A jumped-up pantry boy 
Who never knew his place 
He said ""return the ring""
He knows so much about these things 
He knows so much about these things
I would go out tonight 
But I haven't got a stitch to wear 
This man said ""it's gruesome 
That someone so handsome should care""
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man
Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man
Ah ! A jumped-up pantry boy 
Who never knew his place 
He said ""return the ring""
He knows so much about these things 
He knows so much about these things 
He knows so much about these things

Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now  was released as a single before being included on the compilation album ""Hatful of Hollow"".

Lyrics

I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die?
Two lovers entwined pass me by
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
In my life
Oh, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die?
What she asked of me at the end of the day
Caligula would have blushed
""Oh, you've been in the house too long"" she said
And I naturally fled
In my life
Why do I smile
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye?
I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
""Oh, you've been in the house too long"" she said
And I naturally fled
In my life
Oh, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die?

Lyrics

I would rather not go
Back to the old house
I would rather not go
Back to the old house
There's too many
Bad memories
Too many memories
There...
There...
There...
When you cycled by
Here began all my dreams
The saddest thing I've ever seen
And you never knew
How much I really liked you
Because I never even told you
Oh, and I meant to
Are you still there ?
Or...have you moved away ?
Or have you moved away ?
Oh...
I would love to go
Back to the old house
But I never will
I never will...
I never will...
I never will...

Lyrics

Good time for a change
See, the luck I've had
Can make a good man
Turn bad
So please please please
Let me, let me, let me
Let me get what I want
This time
Haven't had a dream in a long time
See, the life I've had
Can make a good man bad
So for once in my life
Let me get what I want
Lord knows, it would be the first time
Lord knows, it would be the first time

Lyrics

I am the son
And the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of nothing in particular
You shut your mouth
How can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does
I am the son
And the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of nothing in particular
You shut your mouth
How can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does
There's a club if you'd like to go
You could meet somebody who really loves you
So you go and you stand on your own
And you leave on your own
And you go home and you cry
And you want to die
When you say it's gonna happen ""now""
Well when exactly do you mean?
See I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone
You shut your mouth
How can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

Panic was released as a single in 1986 & was the first recording to feature new member Craig Gannon. It was later released on the compilation albums The World Won't Listen and Louder Than Bombs.

Lyrics

Panic on the streets of London 
Panic on the streets of Birmingham 
I wonder to myself 
Could life ever be sane again? 
The leeds side-streets that you slip down 
I wonder to myself 
Hopes may rise on the grasmere 
But honey pie, you're not safe here 
So you run down 
To the safety of the town 
But there's panic on the streets of Carlisle 
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside 
I wonder to myself
Burn down the disco 
Hang the blessed DJ 
Because the music that they constantly play 
It says nothing to me about my life 
Hang the blessed DJ 
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down 
The provincial towns you jog 'round 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ

Lyrics:
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, and she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (Ooh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

When I first heard the song, I felt it would have been dope to have a Mr. & Mrs. Smith themed music video, so I created my own with clips from the film.

Lyrics:
Derulo
Whine fa me darlin'
Way you move ya spine is alarmin'
Mi wan you just...

Big fat thang, overflowin'
Skin tight dress, couldn't hold it
Way too thick like it's swollen
Girl, you're too bad and you know it
When you drop down, lose focus
When that thing clap, that's a bonus
Mmm, that cake looking appetizing
Backpack full, that's a crisis

Bring that body my way
Can't take it off my brain
Look like you do ballet, yeah

Hold tight when you tip toe (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Shake something when you tip toe (girl, oh, oh, oh, oh)
No breaks when you push that back
Left, right, do it just like that
Hold tight when you tip toe (oh, oh, oh, oh)

Ayo, God bless you from behind and (I do)
One hand up like the Heisman (touchdown)
First class seat when ya ridin' (oh yeah)
Wind that thing like ya spineless

Bring that body my way (my way)
Can't take it off my brain (my brain)
Look like you do ballet, yeah

Hold tight when you tip toe (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Shake something when you tip toe (girl, oh, oh, oh, oh)
No breaks when you push that back (that back)
Left, right, do it just like that (like that)
Hold tight when you tip toe (oh, oh, oh, oh)

Whine fa me darlin'
Way you move ya spine is alarmin'
Mi wan you just whine fa me, darlin' (oh, oh, oh, oh)

Oooh, one, tryna figure out who to give ya love
Two, dancin' like a freak 'til a quarter past
Three, you know I'm the one you been looking for
(Montana, ha)

Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek (oh, no)
Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek (ayy, ayy)
Tip toe (tip toe), tip toe (tip toe)
Chains on, got me lookin' like a disco (a disco)
Who that be? And that drop be Mansory (skrrt)
Who that be? Blowin' gas out the 'rari (sk-skrrt)
French vanilla smooth like a 100-year whine
Come sneak up from behind, ""What's ya name?""
""What's ya sign?"" (Huh)
Whine fa me, darlin'
""You want to dock in or fly out??""
Whine fa me, darlin'
""Baby, you want to lease, rent, or buy out??""
Whine fa me, darlin'
When dat money keep blowin', swat, why shorty tip toein'
Got ya left cheek shown, mama
Tip (huh)

Bring that body my way (my way)
Can't take it off my brain
Look like you do ballet, oh

Hold tight when you tip toe (when you tip toe, shake something) (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Shake something when you tip toe (when you tip toe) (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Uh, no breaks when you push that back (that back)

Lyrics

Breakfast in bed darling
I got your bed falling
I make you beg for it
I make you beg for it
Breakfast in bed darling
I got your bed falling
I made mistakes, you done me wrong
But now you leave me calling

Hmm-mmm-mmm
Oh, oh, oh

I heard you got a new girlfriend
And it's hurtin' me
I heard you got a new girlfriend
And it's hurtin'
Yeah, it's hurtin'
Yeah, it's hurtin' me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me
Yeah, it's hurtin' me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me

Tears down my face fallin'
I'm in the place bawlin'
If I ever find her, find her, find her
I'm sendin' shots, I'm sendin' shots
I don't know why you stallin'
Can you give me signs, can you please call me?
Baby, you rewinding it all on me
Baby, give me time, beg you love, love me

Hmm-mmm-mmm
Oh, oh, oh

I heard you got a new girlfriend
And it's hurtin' me
I heard you got a new girlfriend
And it's hurtin'
Yeah, it's hurtin'
Yeah, it's hurtin' me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me (Montana)
Yeah, it's hurtin' me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me (Don)

What you know about goin' out, big jet, big check
Don't care, die for my respect
Life, we gon' live it up
Neck, we don't give it up
Dice, get, get 'em, girl, gon' bet it up
Grind and invest it
Invest like the main role not the ex shit
X-rate movies like Netflix
Never domestic, watchin' her necklace
Young and restless, you know who the best is
Three-quarter, Gucci Mane with the fur shoe
I got a girl, and my girl got a girl too
Hit me with the fab like put it in the bag
Pull up on my new ting, like I knew she mad

I heard you got a new girlfriend
And it's hurtin' me
I heard you got a new girlfriend
And it's hurtin'
Yeah, it's hurtin'
Yeah, it's hurtin' me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me

And I cry, I cry, even my eye cry
But who cares?
Who cares?
And I cry, I cry, even my eye cry
But who cares?
Who cares?

LYRICS:

Han pasado varios d√≠as y estoy enfermo de ti
Dime que me hiciste mal
De mi memoria yo no te puedo borrar
Dios me va a castigar le promet√≠ te iba a olvidar

No hay porque seguir mintiendo 
El tiempo eta‚Äô corriendo y no se puede parar (no se puede parar)
La soledad me sigue consumiendo 
Mas te estoy extra√±ando no lo puedo negar 

Bebe yo soy adicto a tu piel 
Siempre vuelvo a caer aunque quiera romper
Este vicio de ti que me hace mal y a veces me hace bien
Dime que vas hacer e‚Äô-e‚Äô estoy puesto pa‚Äô ti si no quieres de mi yo no voy aparecer e‚Äô
Yo trato de explicarte y tu no quieres entender e‚Äô

Bebe yo soy adicto a tu piel 
Siempre vuelvo a caer aunque quiera romper (romper)
Este vicio de ti que me hace mal y ay veces me hace bien
Dime que vas hacer e‚Äô-er‚Äô estoy puesto pa‚Äô ti si no quieres de mi yo no voy aparece e‚Äô-er‚Äô
Yo trato de explicarte y tu no quieres entender e‚Äô-e‚Äô (mamasita)

Toy adicto no te dejo en visto 
Mamita rica cuando te desvisto 
Un usuario yo te necesito 
Lo que yo hago contigo ya es instinto
Tengo otro amanecer e‚Äô-e‚Äô
Viendo la noche desaparecer e‚Äô-e‚Äô
Y yo no se si tu eres infiel pero contigo quiero hacer 
lo que hicimos aquella vez e‚Äô-e‚Äô

Tengo otro amanecer e‚Äô-e‚Äô

Yo trato de explicarte y tu no quieres entender e‚Äô-e‚Äô (ozuna)

Soy adicto a tu parte 
Me siento un brujo que no puedo olvidarte (olvidarte)
Cada vez que te veo dif√≠cil de esquivarte (Oh‚Äô-Oh‚Äô)
Y despu√©s te toy llamando con ganas de darte 
Y es que (bebe)
Quiero comerte bebe tu sabes ya son las tres 
Que tal si nos vamos pa‚Äô mi casa Y es que es (es)
Si es temprano nos pegamos a la pared (a la pared)
Si tu mam√° te llama la lambo contest√°le 
Y dile que tu estas conmigo (conmigo)
Que no hay nada que somo amigos (amigos)
Que solo fueron dos copa de vino (oh‚Äô-oh‚Äô oh‚Äô-oh‚Äô)
Que los party dan pa el vestido de valentino es algo divino 

Bebe yo soy adicto a tu piel

LYRICS

Dua Lipa:
You know sometimes I think about us 
Now and then
But I never want to fall again

You are deep in water 
Now you are drowning us
You question my love
Like it‚Äôs not enough
but I hate that you know, you know, you know
You got me tied up

You regret it now 
But it‚Äôs your mistake
What makes you think
That my mind will change
And you hate that you know, you know, you know, you know
You messed up

One day you‚Äôll love me again
One day you‚Äôll love me for sure
One day you‚Äôll wake up 
feeling how I‚Äôve been feeling baby
Knock on my door

One day you‚Äôll love me again
Hug me again till the end
One day you‚Äôll beg me to try

One day you‚Äôll realize I‚Äôm more than your lover
I‚Äôm more than your lover I‚Äôm your friend

J Balvin:
Ac√©rcate un poquito no m√°s 
you quiero que te quedes conmigo
deja tus amigas all√° atr√°s
Que nos vamos en un viaje escondidos
Nos vamos pa Turk & Caicos 
y ah√≠ calmamos las ganas
Su√©ltate conmigo mama

Que ya no hay marcha atr√°s
Una noche sin ti, no es tan f√°cil baby
Que yo soy pa ti, y tu eres pa mi
Nunca me dejes de querer
Oh na na na
Contigo por siempre baby
No quiero dejarte esta vez

Dua Lipa:
One day you‚Äôll love me again
One day you‚Äôll love me for sure
One day you‚Äôll wake up 
feeling how I‚Äôve been feeling baby
Knock on my door

One day you‚Äôll love me again
Hug me again till the end
One day you‚Äôll beg me to try

One day you‚Äôll realize I‚Äôm more than your lover
I‚Äôm more than your lover I‚Äôm your friend

Bad Buny:
Ya se que estoy en tu Coraz√≥n
Quiz√°s en el fondo
Otras babys me escriben nunca les respondo
La vida da vueltas y el mundo es redondo
Y yo voy a que te beso de nuevo en London
O si no en Marbella
Encima de la arena viendo las estrellas
Yo se que ni olas han borrado mi huella
Pero tu pichaera es lo que me atropella

Sol, playa y en la arena vamo all√°
Baby no te quedes calla 
Yo s√© que t√∫ quieres guayar conmigo 
Otra vez me tienes en depression
Fumando en la habitaci√≥n
Pero yo s√© que

Dua Lipa:
One day you‚Äôll love me again
One day you‚Äôll love me for sure
One day you‚Äôll wake up 
feeling how I‚Äôve been feeling baby
Knock on my door

One day you‚Äôll love me again
Hug me again till the end
One day you‚Äôll beg me to try

One day you‚Äôll realize I‚Äôm more than your lover
I‚Äôm more than your lover I‚Äôm your friend

Lyrics:
[Intro: Wisin & Jhay Cortez]
W, Yandel
Jhay Cortez
¬øMe sigue'?
This is the remix
(Jhayco)

[Verso 1: Jhay Cortez, Wisin & Yandel]
Me mira como si supiera (Como si supiera),‚ÄÖlo‚ÄÖque hay en‚ÄÖmi mente
Yo quiero robarte hoy (Ho-o-oy),‚ÄÖcomo un delincuente
Pasa m√°s tiempo (Yeah), y m√°s siento, solamente te dir√©
Que si t√∫ me das el chance, no miento (Yeah)
Yo te agarrar√© y har√© contigo (No' vamo'; ¬°duro!)

[Coro: Jhay Cortez & Wisin]
Cosas que nunca imaginastes
Y tocarte en lugares que t√∫ no me ense√±aste-es (Yeah)
Aunque s√© que lo pensastes (Eh-eh-eh-eh; tra-tra-tra)
Y no s√© por qu√© no dices nada (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Si cuando te tocaste (Tra)
Hace tiempo ya que tu cuerpo me hablaba

[Verso 2: Wisin]
(Do-Do-Doble U)
Eso se ve muy duro (Yeah)
Yo me imagino en lo oscuro contigo (Tra)
En un perreo puro (Tra-tra-tra)
Me hiciste un conjuro, me encantas te lo juro
La vas a pasar rico, beb√©, yo te lo aseguro
Deja de fingir, que yo s√© que t√∫ me deseas (W)
Te meneas y a la misma vez me tanteas (Yeah)
¬°Oh!, libra por libra no hay ninguna como t√∫ (Ninguna)
Pero yo s√© que el macho tuyo se llama ""W""
No hay ropa interior (¬°Duro!), flow del exterior (¬°Duro!)
Y el movimiento de la jefa; matador (Mata-matador)
T√∫ y yo combinamos como el cielo y las nubes (Aj√°)
Te imagino sin ropa y que encima m√≠o te subes

[Verso 3: Jhay Cortez]
Eso se nota aunque t√∫ cree' que no se ve (Que no se ve)
Yo vi c√≥mo te pusiste cuando yo te toqu√© (-qu√©)
Yo me puse pa' ti y a las otras las dej√©
Y si preguntan tus amigas por ti, diles que yo te rob√©

[Refr√°n 1: Jhay Cortez]
T√∫, disimulando, oh-oh
Y yo tu mente da√±ando, oh-oh
Adictiva como lo que anda' fumando, oh-oh
Y s√© que anda' pa' lo mismo que yo ando
Pero lo est√°s disimulando, oh-oh
Y yo tu mente da√±ando, oh
Si me mira' y sabes lo que tengo en mente
Pues sabe' que yo quiero hacerte, solo‚Äî

[Coro: Yandel & Jhay Cortez]
Cosas que nunca imaginastes
Y tocarte en lugares que t√∫ no me ense√±aste-es
Aunque s√© que lo pensastes (Eh-eh-eh-eh)
Y no s√© por qu√© no dices nada (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Si cuando te tocaste (-caste)
Hace tiempo ya que tu cuerpo me hablaba

[Verso 4: Wisin & Yandel]
Si yo te quiero, y t√∫ me quieres
Entonces, ¬øpor qu√© ya no vienes? (T√∫ me dices)
Si sabes que por ti me muero (¬°Yandel!)
Yo te deseo, baby, imagina t√∫ y yo, y yo toc√°ndote ah√≠
Aqu√≠ pens√°ndote, eh-eh, la mente da√±√°ndome, eh-eh
Dame calor, oh-oh-oh
S√© que t√∫ no est√°s pa' amor, oh-oh-oh (Aj√°)
Te gust√≥ cuando yo te conoc√≠
¬øQu√© t√∫ crees si despu√©s de aqu√≠ terminamo' as√≠?

[Refr√°n 2: Yandel & Jhay Cortez]
Yo haci√©ndote muchas cosas
En mi mente, otra cosa
Calla√≠ta', silenciosa
T√∫ la' tiene' envidiosa'
Yo haci√©ndote muchas cosa' (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
T√∫ en mi mente, otra cosa (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Vo'a prender pa' que t√∫ tosa'
T√∫ quiere' sexo, no quiere' rosa', y

[Coro: Wisin]
Cosas que nunca imaginaste
Y tocarte en lugares que t√∫ no me ense√±aste
Aunque s√© que lo pensaste, eh-eh
Y no s√© por qu√© no dices nada
Si cuando te tocaste
Hace tiempo ya que tu cuerpo me hablaba

[Outro: Jhay Cortez, Wisin & Yandel]
Se√±oritas
¬°Wisin y Yandel!
W, Yandel
Jhay Cortez (Jajajaja)
¬øMe sigue' o no me sigue' todav√≠a?
Earcandy
Tainy
Jhayco, Jhay Corte'
Personas √©lite de la m√∫sica haciendo √©xitos
Wisin y Yandel, yeah
House of Haze
La Champions League
Famouz
La liga de campeones
Los l√≠deres en la presi√≥n
Este es el remix de la historia (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Con el d√∫o de la historia (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
¬øMe sigue'?

Lyrics:
Esta noche otra vez la veo
Aguantarme las ganas no puedo bebe
No se como voy a pasar
Pero se como va a terminar
Es que todav√≠a no puedo explicar
Lo rica mami que tu estas
En un rato otra vez la veo
Aguantarme las ganas no puedo bebe
No se como voy a pasar
Pero se como va a terminar
Es que todav√≠a no puedo explicar
Lo rica mami que tu estas

Ya estoy afuera,
La veo y todo se me acelera
El lambo pega con tu cartera
Algo m√°gico pasa cuando estamos tu y yo
Esto es una movie
Me siento en LA
Que llegamos despu√©s de las 6
Yo te deseo y no te voy a dar break
Por ti yo rompo la ley
Yeah

Ma te deseo, tu
Te pienso to‚Äô el dia
Me muero por tenerte, yeah
Porque te me resistes?
Si tu me deseas, ma
Se te nota en tu mirada
Que no quieres que me vaya baby

En un rato otra vez la veo
Aguantarme las ganas no puedo bebe
No se como voy a pasar
Pero se como va a terminar
Es que todav√≠a no puedo explicar
Lo rica mami que tu estas

Mami-chula,
Estoy al borde de la locura
La m√°s cara de todas las pinturas
Tus besos todas las penas me curan
Te tengo desnuda
Quieres to‚Äô de eso no tengo duda
Me estrelle en las curvas de tu cintura
Lleg√≥ el momento,
Se acab√≥ la tortura

Ma te deseo
Te pienso todo el dia
Me muero por tenerte, yeah
Porque te me resistes?
Si tu me deseas,
Se te nota en tu mirada
Que no quieres que me vaya baby
En un rato otra vez la veo
Aguantarme las ganas no puedo bebe
No se como voy a pasar
Pero se como va a terminar
Es que todav√≠a no puedo explicar
Lo rica mami que tu estas
Yeah

DIL KO KARAAR AAYA
Lyrics:



Dua bhi lge na ¬†mujhey Dwa bhi lge na mujhey

Jabse dil ko mere tu lga hai ,,

Neend raaton ki meri ,,chahat baaton ki meri ,,

Chain ko bhi mere ¬†tune yu thaga hai,,


Jab saansey bharu mai ,

Band aankhey kru mai,,

Najar tu yaar aaya

O yaar


Dil ko kraar aaya .,

Tujhpe hai pyaar aaya ,,

Pehli pehli baar aaya ¬†,,


O Yaara.....


Dil ko kraar aaya .,

Tujhpe hai pyaar aaya ,,

Pehli pehli baar aaya ¬†,,


O Yaara.....


Har roj puchey ye hawaye hum to bta ¬† ¬†¬†

K haarey ,,

Kyun jikr tera krte h humse taaare ¬†,,

Har roj puchey ye hawaye hum to bta ¬† ¬†¬†

K haarey ,,

Kyun jikr tera krte h humse taaare ¬†,,

Ab kissey hai tere ,,

In hoton pe mere ,,

Izhaar aaya Yaara¬†


Yaara¬†


Dil ko kraar aaya .,

Tujhpe hai pyaar aaya ,,

Pehli pehli baar aaya ¬†,,

O Yaara.....

Lyrics: 
Tere Naam Diyan Dhooma Pai Gayiyan, Tu Chandigarh Ton Aayi Ni..
Tenu Dekh Ke Haunke Bharde Ne Khade Chaunka Vich Sipahi Ni..
Thodi Te Kala Til Kudiye..
Thodi Te Kala Til Kudiye, Jyon Daag Hai Chan De Tukde Te,

Tenu Kala Chashma..Tenu Kala Chashma..
Tenu Kala Chashma Jachda Ae, Jachda Ae Gore Mukhde Te..
Tenu Kala Chashma Jachda Ae, Jachda Ae Gore Mukhde Te.

Sadko Pe Chale Jab Ladko Ke Dilon Ke Mein Tu
Aag Lagadey Baby FIRE
Nakli Sa Nakhrey Tu Kare Jab Dekhe Hume
Jhoothi LIAR
Kala Kala Chashma Jo Jaata Hai Tere Mukhde Pe
Jaisa Kaala Til Jachta Hai Tere Chin Pe
Apni Adaon Se Zyaada Nahin Toh Dus Baara Ladke Toh Maar Hi Deti Hogi Tu Din Mein

Tujh Jaise Chattis Phirtey Hai
Meri Wargi Aur Na Honi Ve 
Tu Munda Bilkul Desi Hai
Main Katrina Toh Sohni Ve

Hai Main Fed Up Hogaya Mundaya Sun Sunke Tere Dukhdey Ve
O Mainu Kala Chashma 
O Mainu Kala Kala Kala Kala
O Mainu Kala Chashma Jachda Ae, Jachda Ae Gore Mukhde Te..
Mainu Kala Chashma Jachda Ae, Jachda Ae Gore Mukhde Te..
Jachda Ae Gore Mukhde Te..

Sadko Pe Chale Jab Ladko Ke Dilon Ke Mein Tu
Aag Lagadey Baby FIRE

O Mainu
O Mainu

Nakli Sa Nakhrey Tu Kare Jab Dekhe Hume
Jhoothi LIAR

O Mainu Kala Chashma
O Mainu Kala Kala Chashma
Aye Kala Chashma
O Kala Kala Kala Kala Kala

Tenu Kala Chashma Jachda Ae, Jachda Ae Gore Mukhde Te..
Mainu Kala Chashma Jachda Ae, Jachda Ae Gore Mukhde Te.
Mainu Kala Chashma Jachda Ae, Jachda Ae Gore Mukhde Te..

Lyrics:

Read my fortune too
Tell me what you see
Cross it like a t
It‚Äôs all the same to me

This game I play
I do it everyday

Then promise i‚Äôll be fine
Bear it every time

When you turn the lights down low
Lemon color honey glow

See this state I‚Äôm in
Is crawling in my skin
Fevers took me back
And turned me inside out

When you turn the lights down low
Lemon color honey glow

It‚Äôs what you do
This pulls me through
To the other end
Where it begins

You see through me
Still it‚Äôs coming back
I come alive
You stay all night

You feel it coming right through you
The color of your mind

The color of your mind
The color of your mind

You feel it coming right through you
It‚Äôs on the other side

It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way
The color of your mind

It‚Äôs what you do
This pulls me through
I come alive

You stay all night
It‚Äôs what you do

This pulls me through
I come alive
You stay all night

Candy-colored misery
the color of your mind",True,True,42352803.0,dream pop

""Like It's Christmas"" Lyrics:

The snow on the ground
The love in the air
The sleigh bells are ringing
This is what it's all about
The fire is warm
The angels are singing
And I don't wanna miss
A single thing
Don't wanna put an end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always that time of the year
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Never wanna stop
Feeling like the first thing on your wish list
Right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feeling inside
Nothing fake about the way you bring me to life
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Every day that I'm with you
Look at the lights
Twinkling bright
24/7
Every inch of Central Park
Is covered in white
This could be Heaven
And I don't wanna miss
A single thing
Don't wanna put an end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always that time of the year
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Never wanna stop
Feeling like the first thing on your wish list
Right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feeling inside
Nothing fake about the way you bring me to life
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Every day that I'm with you
Every day that I'm with you
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Never wanna stop
Feeling like the first thing on your wish list
Right up at the top (and I can't deny)
I can't deny what I'm feeling inside
Nothing fake about the way you bring me to life
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Every day that I'm with you
I can't deny what I'm feeling inside
No matter the reason, no matter the season
My heart'll keep beating, you better believe
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Every day that I'm with you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Every day that I'm with you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Every day that I'm with you

‚ñ∫""What A Man Gotta Do"" Lyrics:

Cut my heart about one, two times
Don't need to question the reason, I'm yours, I'm yours
I know the other lose a fight just to see you smile
'Cause you got no flaws, no flaws

I'm not tryin' to be your part-time lover
Sign me up for the full-time, I'm yours, all yours

So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta say?
What a man gotta pray?
To be your last good night and your first good day
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta do?
What a man gotta prove?
To be totally locked up by you

You ain‚Äôt trying to be wasting time
On stupid people and cheap lines, I'm sure, I'm sure
So I'd give a million dollars just to go grab me by the collar
And I‚Äôm gonna be lost, be lost

I'm not tryin' to be your part-time lover
Sign me up for the full-time, I'm yours, I'm yours, woo!

So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta say?
What a man gotta pray?
To be your last good night and your first good day
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta do?
What a man gotta prove?
To be totally locked up by you

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Tell me what a man gotta do?

So, what a man gotta do? (What a man gotta do?)
What a man gotta do? (What a man gotta do, yeah?)
To be totally locked up by you (Totally locked up by you)
What a man gotta say? (What a man gotta say?)
What a man gotta pray? (What a man gotta pray?)
To be your last good night and your first good day (Aay)
So, what a man gotta do? (What a man gotta do?)
What a man gotta do? (Woah)
To be totally locked up by you (Totally locked up by you)
What a man gotta do? (Hey, baby)
What a man gotta prove? (What a man gotta prove?)
To be totally locked up by you (Totally locked up by you)

‚ÄúOnly Human‚Äù Lyrics: 

Yeah, ayy

I don't want this night to end
It‚Äôs closing time, so leave with me again (Yeah)
You got all my love to spend, oh
Let's find a place where happiness begins

We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I‚Äôm leaving you (Ayy)
Just dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Drunk to an '80s groove (Ayy)
We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I'm leaving you (Ayy)
Dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Drunk

It's only human, you know that it's real
So why would you fight or try to deny the way that you feel?
Oh, babe, you can't fool me, your body's got other plans
So stop pretending you‚Äôre shy, just come on and
Dance, dance, dance, dance, oh

Early morning la-la-light
Only getting up to close the blinds, oh
I‚Äôm praying you don't change your mind
‚ÄôCause leaving now just don't feel right
Let's do it one more time, oh babe

We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I‚Äôm leaving you (Hurts when I'm leaving you)
Just dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Drunk to an '80s groove (Ayy)
We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I'm leaving you (Ayy)
Dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Drunk

It's only human, you know that it's real (Know that it's real)
So why would you fight or try to deny the way that you feel?
(The way that you feel)
Oh, babe, you can't fool me, your body's got other plans
So stop pretending you're shy, just come on and
Dance, dance, dance, dance, oh

Dance, oh (Woo, ayy)
Only human
It's only (-man), it's only (-man)
Only human
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Only human
It's only (-man), it's only (-man)
Only human

I Need You Christmas Lyrics: 
I need you Christmas
Friends by the fire to hold
Times have been lonely
And lately I just feel alone

I need you Christmas
Family with nowhere to go
Angels on treetops and angels in the snow
Oh the cold 

Seasons Change
Come and go
But there ºs one thing I know
You‚Äôll just stay the same
You don‚Äôt ever change

I miss the feeling
Waiting for Santa to show
Caroling late night 
And all the children ºs eyes aglow

I need you Christmas 
Oh how I miss you the most
Greetings from loved ones
And lovers under mistletoe

If you ºre young
If you ºre old
We all wait to be told
Just a simple phrase
‚ÄúHave a merry Christmas‚Äù

Seaons change
Come and go
But there ºs one thing I hope
You ºll just stay the same
‚ÄòCause I need you Christmas",False,True,45948796.0,pop music

‚ñ∫""Who‚Äôs In Your Head"" Lyrics:
You moved like magic
You moved like time
You had your heart disguised
When you cry diamonds
Yea they shine
But they blind my eyes and now
 
I hear the whispers every night
Even when I‚Äôm dreaming
Now tell me baby were you ever mine
 
I wanna know who‚Äôs in your head
Stealing your heart while I‚Äôm still bleeding
Who‚Äôs in your bed
Wrapped in your arms while I ain‚Äôt sleeping
Got lost in your halo halo
I just wanna know
Now who‚Äôs in your head in your head
I wanna know who‚Äôs in your head in your head
 
You move like danger
But I don‚Äôt mind
The way you talking with your eyes
You leave me broken
No I can't lie
It gets me every time...and now
 
I hear the whispers every night
Even when I‚Äôm dreaming
Now tell me baby were you ever mine
 
I wanna know who‚Äôs in your head
Stealing your heart while I‚Äôm still bleeding
Who‚Äôs in your bed
Wrapped in your arms while I ain‚Äôt sleeping
Got lost in your halo halo
I just wanna know
Now who‚Äôs in your head in your head
I wanna know who‚Äôs in your head in your head
 
You get me down
On my knees
On my knees yeah
You drive me wild
When you want
When you want it
Oh you get me down
On my knees
On my knees yeah
Cuz everytime I look into your eyes
Look into your eyes

You know you've got everybody lookin'

Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love
Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the tool box, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate
Girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing

She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""No way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like, oh, my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""

Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn't have to try
Let's lay down tonight

My daddy spent his life lookin' up at the sky
He'd cuss kick the dust, sayin' son it's way to dry
It clouds up in the city, the weather man complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing

Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, 4 wheel drive
And a tail light circle
Roll down the windows turn it on up
Pour a little Crown in a Dixie cup
Get the party, started

Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in the full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm mmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money make it gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

Woah, woah, mmm

If I could make a livin' walkin' in the woods
You could bet I'd be sittin' pretty good
High on a hill lookin' at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off a turning 'em bass
Never worry about the price of gas
I'd be wheelin' and dealin' and sittin' there reelin' 'em in

A huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin' and late in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River pay
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day

Kick the dust up
All week long it's a farming town, they're making that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights backing up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down

And that song come on girl kick it on back, Z71 like a Cadillac
We go way out where there ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield into a party
Pedal to the floorboard end up in a
Four door burning up a backroad song
Park it and we pile out
Baby watch your step now, better have your boots on

Lyrics:

MUKHDA
Mujhko itna bataaye koi
Kaise tujh se dil no lagaaye koi

Rabba ne tujhko banaane mein
Kar di hain husn ki ‡§ñ‡§º‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä tijoriyaan
 
Kaajal ki 
Siyaahi se likhi 
Hain tu ne jaane
Kitnon ki love storiyaan 

[ Kesariya tera ishq hai piya
Rang jaaun jo main
Haath lagaaun
Din beete saara teri fikr mein
‡§∞‡•à‡§® saari teri ‡§ñ‡•à‡§∞ manaaun] x2

ANTARA
‡§™‡§§‡§ù‡§°‡§º ke mausam mein bhi
‡§∞‡§Ç‡§ó‡•Ä chanaaron jaisi
Jhanke sannaaton mein tu
Veena (‡§µ‡•Ä‡§®‡§æ) ke taaron jaisi

Sadiyon se bhi Iambi ye
Man ki amaavasein hain
Aur to phuljhadiyon vaale
Tyohaaron jaisi ..

Chanda bhi deevaana hai tera
Jalti hain tujhse
Saari chakoriyaan 

Kaajal ki
Siyaahi se likhi
Hain tu ne jaane
Kitnon ki love storiyaan

[Kesariya tera ishq hai piya
Rang jaaun jo main
Haath lagaaun
Din beete saara teri fikr mein
‡§∞‡•à‡§® saari teri ‡§ñ‡•à‡§∞ manaaun] x2
