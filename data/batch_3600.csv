Lyrics

Shut your eyes and think of somewhere
Somewhere cold and caked in snow
By the fire, we break the quiet
Learn to wear each other well

And when the worrying starts to hurt
And the world feels like graves of dirt
Just close your eyes until
You can imagine this place
Yeah, our secret space, at will

Shut your eyes, I'll spin the big chair
And you'll feel dizzy, light and free
And falling gently on the cushion
You can come and sing to me

And when the worrying starts to hurt
And the world feels like graves of dirt
Just close your eyes until
You can imagine this place
Yeah, our secret space, at will

(Shut your eyes)
(Shut your eyes)
Shut your eyes
Shut your eyes
Shut your eyes and sing to me
(Shut your eyes and sing to me)
Shut your eyes and sing to me
(Shut your eyes and sing to me)
Shut your eyes and sing to me
(Shut your eyes and sing to me)
Shut your eyes and sing to me
(Shut your eyes and sing to me)

Lyrics

This could be the very minute
I'm aware I'm alive
All these places feel like home

With a name I'd never chosen
I can make my first steps
As a child of 25

This is the straw
Final straw in the
Roof of my mouth
As I lie to you
Just because I'm sorry doesn't mean
I didn't enjoy it at the time

You're the only thing that I love
Scares me more every day
On my knees I think clearer

Goodness knows I saw it coming
Or at least I'll claim I did
But in truth, I'm lost for words

What have I done?
It's too late for that
What have I become?
Truth is nothing yet
A simple mistake starts the hardest time
I promise I'll do anything you ask
This time

Lyrics

You cool your bedwarm hands down
On the broken radiator
When you lay them freezing on me
I mumble can you wake me later
But I don't really want you to stop
And you know it so it doesn't stop you
You run your hands from my neck
To my chest

Crack the shutters open wide
I want to bathe you in the light of day
And just watch you as the rays
Tangle up around your face and body
I could sit for hours
Finding new ways to be awed each minute
'Cause the daylight seems to want you
Just as much as I want you

It's been minutes it's been days
It's been all I will remember
Happy lost in your hair
And the cold side of the pillow
Your hills and valleys
Are mapped by my intrepid fingers
And in a naked slumber
I dream all this again

Crack the shutters open wide
I want to bathe you in the light of day
And just watch you as the rays
Tangle up around your face and body
I could sit for hours
Finding new ways to be awed each minute
'Cause the daylight seems to want you
Just as much as I want you

Crack the shutters open wide
I want to bathe you in the light of day
And just watch you as the rays
Tangle up around your face and body
I could sit for hours
Finding new ways to be awed each minute
'Cause the daylight seems to want you
Just as much as I want you

Lyrics

I find the map and draw a straight line
Over rivers, farms, and state lines
The distance from ""A"" to where you'd ""B""
It's only finger-lengths that I see
I touch the place
Where I'd find your face
My fingers in creases
Of distant dark places

I hang my coat up in the first bar
There is no peace that I've found so far
The laughter penetrates my silence
As drunken men find flaws in science
Their words, mostly noises
Ghosts with just voices
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me

And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground and I
I pray that somethin' picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

After I have travelled so far
We'd set the fire to the third bar
We'd share each other like an island
Until exhausted, close our eyelids
And dreaming, pick up from
The last place we left off
Your soft skin is weepin'
A joy you can't keep in

And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground and I
I pray that somethin' picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms
And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground and I
I pray that somethin' picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

Charles Edward Anderson ""Chuck"" Berry (born October 18, 1926) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter and is one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. With songs such as ""Maybellene"" (1955), ""Roll Over Beethoven"" (1956), ""Rock and Roll Music"" (1957) and ""Johnny B. Goode"" (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music.
Born into a middle-class African-American family in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high-school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess, of Chess Records. With Chess he recorded ""Maybellene""—Berry's adaptation of the country song ""Ida Red""—which sold over a million copies, reaching number one on Billboard magazine's rhythm and blues chart. By the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub, Berry's Club Bandstand. But in January 1962, he was sentenced to three years in prison for offenses under the Mann Act—he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines.

Chuck Berry - You Never Can Tell



It was a teenage wedding,
and the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur
and madame have rung the chapel bell,
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks,
it goes to show you never can tell

They furnished off an apartment
with a two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed
with TV dinners and ginger ale,
But when Pierre found work,
the little money comin' worked out well
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks,
it goes to show you never can tell

They had a hi-fi phono, boy, did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records,
all rock, rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down,
the rapid tempo of the music fell
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks,
it goes to show you never can tell

They bought a souped-up jitney,
'twas a cherry red '53,
They drove it down New Orleans
to celebrate their anniversary
It was there that Pierre was married
to the lovely mademoiselle

it goes to show you never can tell",False,False,190093048.0,rock music

Lyrics:
I wish I knew how it would feel to be free
I wish I could break all the chains holding me
I wish I could say all the things that I should say
Say 'em loud, say 'em clear
For the whole round world to hear

I wish I could share all the love that's in my heart
Remove all the bars that keep us apart
I wish you could know what it means to be me
Then you'd see and agree
That every man should be free

I wish I could give all I'm longing to give
I wish I could live like I'm longing to live
I wish I could do all the things that I can do
Though I'm way overdue, I'd be starting anew

Well, I wish I could be like a bird in the sky
How sweet it would be if I found I could fly
Oh, I'd soar to the sun and look down at the sea
And then I'd sing 'cause I'd know, yeah
Then I'd sing 'cause I'd know, yeah
Then I'd sing 'cause I'd know
I'd know how it feels
I'd know how it feels to be free, yeah, yeah
Oh, I'd know how it feels
Yes, I'd know, I'd know how it feels
How it feels to be free, Lord, Lord, Lord, yeah

Lyrics:
I want a little sugar in my bowl
I want a little sweetness down in my soul
I could stand some lovin', oh so bad
I feel so funny, I feel so sad

I want a little steam on my clothes
Maybe I can fix things up so they'll go
What's the matter, Daddy? Come on, save my soul
I need some sugar in my bowl, I ain't foolin'
I want some sugar in my bowl

You been acting different, I've been told
Soothe me, I want some sugar in my bowl

I want some steam on my clothes
Maybe I can fix things up so they'll go
What's the matter Daddy? Come on, save my soul
I want some sugar in my bowl, I ain't foolin'
I want some sugar hmm, in my bowl

Lyrics:
Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the French I took

But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be

Don't know much about geography
Don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for

But I do know one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful world this would be

Now I don't claim to be an 'A' student
But I'm trying to be
For maybe by being an 'A' student, baby
I can win your love for me

Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the French I took

But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be

History
Biology
Science book
French I took, yeah

But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be

Lyrics: 
I was born by the river in a little tent
Oh, and just like the river I’ve been a-runnin’ ever since.
It’s been a long, a long time comin’,
but I know, oh-oo-oh,
a change gon’ come, oh yes, it will.

It’s been too hard living but I’m afraid to die
‘Cause I don’t know what’s up there beyond the sky
It’s been a long, a long time comin’,
But I know, oh-oo-oh,
A change gonna come, oh yes, it will.

I go to the movie and I go downtown
Somebody keep tellin’ me don’t hang around.
It’s been a long, a long time coming, but I know, oh-oo-oh,
A change gon’ come, oh yes, it will.

Then I go, oh-oo-oh, to my brother and I say, brother, help me please.
But he winds up knocking me back down on my knees, oh.

There’ve been times that I thought I couldn’t last for long
But now I think I’m able to carry on
It’s been a long, a long time comin’,
But I know, oh-oo-oh, a change gonna come, oh yes, it will.

Lyrics:  
Another Saturday night, but I ain’t got nobody
I got some money, ‘cause I just got paid.
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to.
I’m in an awful way.
 
Dig This
 
I got in town a month ago, 
I seen a lot of girls since then.
If I could meet ‘em I could get ‘em,
Bu as yet I haven’t met ‘em.
That’s why I’m in the shape I’m in.
 
Here… Another Saturday night,
And I ain’t got nobody.
I got some money, ‘cause I just got paid.
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to.
I’m in an awful way.
Now, another fella told me,
He had a sister who looked just fine.
Instead of being my deliverance,
(Spoken: ) She had a strange resemblance
To a cat named Frankenstein.
 
Here… Another Saturday
And I ain’t got nobody
I got some money, ‘cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had some chick to talk to.
I’m in an awful way. 
 
Yeah.
 
(Spoken: ) Here it is, another weekend and I ain’t got nobody.
Man, if I was back home I’d be swingin’ two chicks on my arm.
Aw, yeah.
 
Listen to me, huh?
 
It’s hard on a fella,
When he don’t know his way around.
If I don’t find me a honey
To help me spend my money
I’m gonna have to blow this town,
Here it’s… Another Saturday Night
And I ain’t got nobody
I got some money, ‘cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had some chick to talk to.
I’m in an awful… everybody sing….

Another Saturday night
And I ain’t got nobody.
I got some money, ‘cause I just got paid.
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to.
I’m in an awful…. One more time…

Another Saturday night
And I ain’t got nobody.
I got some money, ‘cause I just got paid.
Now how I wish I had some chick to talk to.
I’m in an awful… soundin’ mighty good…. 
Another Saturday night

Record Review of Sam Cooke's 1957 self titled debut LP from Gaslight Records

If you had your hands on the wheel you'd realise the road is wrapping around the edges in front of us, but you like the way the wheel is turning itself.

We've both agreed that 'gay paris' is sometimes relevant but that neither of us would ever say it.

White leather interiors and aqua exteriors up on the cliffs above the ocean, it's a convertible and that's even okay, 'Danny Boy' is playing now and that's even okay cause Sam Cooke is singing it.

You could even throw your hands up or let some kind of long scarf out into the breeze and I wouldn't hate you for it.

My shirt's open to the world and I don't hate myself for it.

'Ol' Man River' sees the broken lines pass us by in perfect time.

We should drive to Vermont and never go to sleep.

It's okay to not have the right friends.

I know I don't yet understand, but Sam Cooke's making me feel like I do.

I know that we never understood those eggnog parties with the red sweaters and the Italian knit, shoestring, handmade crocodile leather, chino teeth, double stitched, freshly cut, short back and slow and steady.

We were laughing cause we had to.

I was sitting on part of the three piece sectional by the fire, and you were standing on the green lyno with the ladies talking spritzers' and love cause we had to.

Bobby Vee was drawling through the dream time stereo and bouncing off the brain and out into the big black dull.

The bodies were moving considerately.

No one could come to an agreement as to why Bill had never married.

Lorraine had locked the ill-disciplined dog in the kennel, couldn't have it crapping on the shampooed carpet and ruining Christmas.

It was a night they'd all talk about for years.

The kids were all chocolate faces and fire crackers.

The stereo was melting.

We had to leave before the walls melted, and we listen to 'You Send Me' and 'Tammy' on the way across the country.

Sometimes worry free records are nice. Sometimes they even become something unintentionally profound in a way, and that is the case with this Sam Cooke album -- a record angled at the easy listener, if not by the artist then definitely by the record label, that instead has retained the power to take someone 50 years later into some kind of strangely self-reflective daydream.

He had sustained a gunshot wound to the chest.
The motel's manager reported that she had shot Cooke in self-defense after he broke into her office residence and attacked her. However, the details of the case involving Cooke's death have remained in dispute.

La-da-da all night long
Yeah! 
La-da-la-la-ta-da
La-da-da-da-da-ta-da

Come on and let the good time roll
We gonna stay here till we soothe our souls

One more time

Come on and let the good time roll
We gonna stay here till we soothe our souls
If it take all night long

Gotta tell you, evenin' sun is sinkin' low
The clock on the wall say it's time to go
I got my plans, I don't know ‘bout you
I'll tell you exactly what I'm gonna do

Get in the groove and let the good time roll
I'm gonna stay here till I soothe my soul
If it take all night long
Yeah! 

Everybody let the good time roll
We gonna stay here till we soothe our souls
If it take all night long
Yeah!

It might be one o'clock and it might be three
Time don't mean that much to me
I ain’t felt this good since I don't know when
And I might not feel this good again

So come on and let the good time roll
We gonna stay here till we soothe our souls
If it take all night long

And all night (all night) and all night (all night)
And all night (all night) and all night long (all night)
Somebody said it might take (all night) all night long
And all night (all night) and all night (all night)

Come on and let the good time roll
We gonna stay here till we soothe our souls

Lyrics:

Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV, and the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you
What has happened to it all?
Crazy someone say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away
But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well now prides gone out the window
Cross the rooftops, run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart
What is happening to me?
Crazy someone say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away
But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Besides the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk
And I don't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Every world is my world
(I will learn to survive)
Any world is my world
(I will learn to survive)
Any world is my world",True,True,242130793.0,new wave

Lyrics:

Dark in the city night is a wire
Steam in the subway earth is afire
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
Woman you want me give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt down I'm after you
Smell like I sound I'm lost in a crowd
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Straddle the line in discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt down I'm after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Stalked in the forest too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
High blood drumming on your skin it's so tight
You feel my heat I'm just a moment behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
In touch with the ground
I'm on the huntdown after you
Scent and a sound
I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line it's discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine I'm after you
Mouth is alive all running inside
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Burning the ground I break from the crowd
I'm on the huntdown I'm after you
I smell like I sound
I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line it's discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt down I'm after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Burning the ground I break from the crowd
I'm on the huntdown I'm after you

Lyrics:
Mine, immaculate dream made breath and skin
I've been waiting for you
Signed with a home tattoo
Happy birthday to you was created for you
Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can I believe you're taking my heart to pieces?
Ah, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime to come undone
Now we'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry
Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone
Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone
Words, playing me deja vu
Like a radio tune, I swear I've heard before
Chill, is it something real?
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers
Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can I believe you're taking my heart to pieces?
Lost, in a snow filled sky
We'll make it alright to come undone
Now we'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry
Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone
Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone (Can't ever keep from falling apart)
Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone (Can't ever keep from falling apart)
Who do you need?
Who do you love? (Can't ever keep from falling apart)
Who do you love?

Lyrics:
See them walking hand in hand
Across the bridge at midnight
Heads turning as the lights flashing out
Are so bright
And walk right out to the four line track
There's a camera rolling on her back
On her back
And I sense a rhythm humming in a frenzy
All the way down her spine
Girls on film
Girls on film
Girls on film
Girls on film
Lipstick cherry all over the lens as she's falling
And miles of sharp blue water coming in
Where she lies
The diving man's coming up for air
'Cause the crowd all love pulling dolly by the hair
By the hair
And she wonders how she ever got here
As she goes under again
Girls on film (two minutes later)
Girls on film
Girls on film (got your picture)
Girls on film
Wider, baby, smile and you've just made a million
Fuses pumping live heat twisting out on a wire
Take one last glimpse into the night
I'm touching close
I'm holding bright
Holding tight
Give me shudders in a whisper
Take me up 'til I'm shooting a star
Girls on film (she's more than a lady)
Girls on film
Girls on film (two minutes later)
Girls on film
Girls on film (see you together)
Girls on film
Girls on film (see you later)

Lyrics:

You saw me standing by the wall corner of a main street
And the lights are flashing on your window sill
All alone ain't much fun so you're looking for the thrill
And you know just what it takes and where to go
Don't save a prayer for me now 
Save it til the morning after
No don't say a prayer for me now 
Save it til the morning after
Feel the breeze deep on the inside look you down into the well
If you can you'll see the world in all his fire
Take a chance like all dreamers can't find another way
You don't have to dream it all, just live a day
Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
No don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Pretty looking road I try to hold the rising floods that fill my skin
Don't ask me why I'll keep my promise melt the ice
And you wanted to dance so I asked you to dance
But fear is in your soul
Some people call it a one night stand but we can call it paradise
Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it til the morning after
No don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after (doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)

Lyrics:

Moving on the floor now babe you're a bird of paradise
Cherry ice cream smile I suppose it's very nice
With a step to your left and a flick to the right
You catch that mirror way out west
You know you're something special and you look like you're the best

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on TV
Two, of a billion stars it means so much to me
Like a birthday or a pretty view
But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

Hey now (wow) look at that did he nearly run you down
At the end of the drive the lawmen arrive you make me feel
Alive, alive, alive

I'll take my chance 'cause luck is on my side
I tell you something I know what you're thinking
I tell you something I know what you're thinking

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twists across a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

Her name is Rio, she don't need to understand
And I might find her if I'm looking like I can
Oh Rio Rio hear them shout across the land
From mountains in the north down to the Rio Grande

Lyrics:

Wild boys
Wild boys
Wild boys
Wild boys
Wild, wild, boys, boys
The wild boys are calling
On their way back from the fire
In August moon's surrender to
A dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory
Reckless and so hungered
On the razors edge you trail
Because there's murder by the roadside
In a sore afraid new world
They tried to break us 
Looks like they'll try again
Wild boys (wild boys) never lose it
Wild boys (wild boys) never chose this way
Wild boys (wild boys) never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine
You got sirens for a welcome
There's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing
While you're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory
Where is all you angels
Now the figureheads of have fell
And lovers war with arrows
Over secrets they could tell
They tried to tame you looks like they'll try again
Wild boys (wild boys) never lose it
Wild boys (wild boys) never chose this way
Wild boys (wild boys) never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine
Wild boys
Wild boys
Wild boys
Wild boys
Wild boys
Wild boys
Wild boys (wild boys) never lose it
Wild boys (wild boys) never chose this way
Wild boys (wild boys) never close your eyes
Wild boys always
Wild boys (wild boys) never lose it
Wild boys (wild boys) never chose this way
Wild boys (wild boys) never close your eyes
Wild boys always
Wild boys (wild boys) never lose it
Wild boys (wild boys) never chose this way

Etta James made many appearances at the Montreux Jazz Festival across her long and distinguished career from her first concert in 1975 through to her last in 2008. 

This video focuses on the concert from 1975. It features many of her best loved tracks and songs that she is particularly associated with. Etta James was one of the most respected performers of her generation. In a career stretching over 60 years she was inducted into the Rock'n'Roll Hall Of Fame and the Blues Hall Of Fame, won 3 Grammys and received many more nominations and was named Female Blues Artist Of The Year on no less than 14 occasions. 

Etta James sadly passed away after a long illness in January 2012 and this video is a fitting tribute to one of the greatest female vocalists of the 20th century.

Lyrics:
You belong among the wildflowers
You belong in a boat out at sea
Sail away, kill off the hours
You belong somewhere you feel free

Run away, find you a lover
Go away somewhere all bright and new
I have seen no other
Who compares with you

You belong among the wildflowers
You belong in a boat out at sea
You belong with your love on your arm
You belong somewhere you feel free

Run away, go find a lover
Run away, let your heart be your guide
You deserve the deepest of cover
You belong in that home by and by

You belong among the wildflowers
You belong somewhere close to me
Far away from your trouble and worry
You belong somewhere you feel free
You belong somewhere you feel free

Lyrics:
Lyrics:
Let me run with you tonight
I’ll take you on a moonlight ride
There’s someone I used to see
But she don’t give a damn for me
 
So let me get to the point, let’s roll another joint
And turn the radio loud, I’m too alone to be proud
You don’t know how it feels
You don’t know how it feels to be me
 
People come, people go
Some grow young, some grow cold
I woke up in between
A memory and a dream

So let’s get to the point, let’s roll another joint
Let’s head on down the road 
To somewhere I gotta go
You don’t know how it feels
You don’t know how it feels to be me
 
My old man was born to rock
He’s still tryin’ to beat the clock
Think of me what you will
I’ve got a little space to fill
 
So let’s get to the point, let’s roll another joint
Let’s head on down the road
To somewhere I gotta go
And you don’t know how it feels
You don’t know how it feels 
You don’t know how it feels to be me
You don’t know how it feels 
No you don’t know how it feels 
You don’t know how it feels to be me

Lyrics:
Tonight we ride, right or wrong
Tonight we sail, on a radio song
Rescue me, should I go down
If I stay too long in trouble town

Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
Yeah, you break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do

Now and again, I get the feeling
Well, if I don't win, I'm a-gonna break even
Rescue me, should I go wrong
If I dig too deep, if I stay too long

Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
Yeah, you break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do

I'll be the boy in the corduroy pants
You'll be the girl at the high school dance
Run with me, wherever I go
And just play dumb, whatever you know

Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
Yeah, you break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do
You wreck me, baby
Yeah, you break me in two
Oh, but you move me, honey
Ah, yes, you do

Letra ""Loco (Tu forma de ser)""

Te vi llegar 
del brazo de un amigo 
cuando entraste al bar 
y te caíste al piso, 
me tiraste el pingüino, 
me tiraste el sifón, 
estallaron los vidrios de mi corazón. 

Te vi bailar, 
brillando con tu ausencia 
sin sentir piedad 
chocando con las mesas. 

Te burlaste de todos, 
te reíste de mí 
tus amigos escaparon de vos… 

Y a mí me volvió loco tu forma de ser, 
a mi me vuelve loco tu forma de ser. 
Tu egoísmo y tu soledad 
son estrellas en la noche de la mediocridad. 

Me vuelve loco tu forma de ser, 
a mi me volvió loco tu forma de ser. 
Tu egoísmo y tu soledad 
son joyas en el barro de la mediocridad. 

Viniste a mi, 
tomaste de mi copa, 
me sonreíste así, 
nadando en tu demencia. 

No sabía que hacer, 
te traté de besar, 
me pegaste un sopapo 
y te pusiste a llorar. 

Me vuelve loco tu forma de ser, 
a mi me volvió loco tu forma de ser. 
Tu egoísmo y tu soledad 
son estrellas en la noche de la mediocridad. 

Me vuelve loco tu forma de ser, 
a mi me volvió loco tu forma de ser. 
Tu egoísmo y tu soledad 
son joyas en el barro de la mediocridad.

Letra ""Amor""

Cansado de buscar, y herido en mil fracasos
había decidido caminar en soledad
sin pena ni pasión
y en eso apareciste, todo cambió.

Me fui acercando a vos, con suma precaución
midiendo cada paso, retorcido en mi interior
librándome de miedos y de deudas del ayer
para intentar de nuevo, volver a querer.

Me entregue y yo no me arrepiento
nunca estuve así de contento
y hoy me paso el día cantando
sin pensar hasta cuando.

Amor
cierro los ojos y salto al vacío
Amor
como negarme a tu cálido abismo
Amor
sutil narcótico, suave y fragante
Amor
puede hacer polvo el diamante. 

Buscaba sin saber Lo que encontré en tus brazos
Me había resignado a una vida en soledad
Sin pena ni pasión y en eso apareciste
Y todo cambió 

Me fui acercando a vos, con suma precaución
midiendo cada paso, retorcido en mi interior
librándome de miedos y de deudas del ayer
para intentar de nuevo, volver a querer.

Me entregue y no me arrepiento
mi vida cambió desde ese momento
y hoy me paso el día cantando
sin pensar hasta cuando.

Amor
cierro los ojos y salto al vacío
Amor
como negarme a tu cálido abismo
Amor
sutil narcótico, suave y fragante
Amor
puede hacer polvo el diamante.

Dicen Los Deca: “Los Tigres del Norte han sido una gran influencia para nosotros desde siempre. Muchas de nuestras canciones fueron motivadas por ese ritmo norteño tan encantador que traen ellos. Los quisimos antes de conocerlos y cuando por fin tuvimos oportunidad de compartir en persona nos terminaron de romper la cabeza. Amor, admiración y respeto eterno para Los Tigres”. Y continúa: “La participación de Natalia fue increíblemente mágica. Nosotros estábamos grabando Golpes… y ella estaba trabajando en el estudio contiguo. Era tal nuestro alboroto que alguien de su equipo se acercó amablemente a pedir un poco de calma. Cucho, con esa simpatía hermosa que tiene, fue inmediatamente a buscarla y a los pocos minutos estábamos todos juntos grabando la canción. Si lo hubiéramos planeado nunca lo habríamos logrado. La frescura con la que ella llegó quedó plasmada en la canción. Un lujo y un honor hacer esta versión con Natalia""",True,True,27510433.0,ska

They officially entered the  Hall of Fame during a special pandemic-era broadcast and streaming event that replaced the annual live induction ceremony.

The Doobie Brothers are an American rock band from San Jose, California. Active for five decades, with their greatest success in the 1970s, the group's current lineup consists of founding members Tom Johnston (guitars, vocals) and Patrick Simmons (guitars, vocals), veteran member Michael McDonald (keyboards, vocals), longtime member John McFee (guitars, pedal steel, violin, backing vocals), and touring musicians including John Cowan (bass, vocals), Bill Payne (keyboards), Marc Russo (saxophones), Ed Toth (drums), and Marc Quiñones (percussion).

The band's history can be roughly divided into three eras. From 1970 to 1975 it featured lead vocalist Johnston and a mainstream rock and roll sound with elements of folk, country and R&B. Johnston quit the group in 1977, and was replaced by Michael McDonald, whose interest in soul music changed the band's sound until it broke up in 1982 with Simmons being the only constant member having appeared on all of their albums. In 1987, the Doobie Brothers reformed with Johnston back in the fold; McDonald, who had previously made several guest appearances since their reformation, returned to the band full-time in 2019 for their upcoming 50th anniversary tour. Every incarnation of the group has emphasized vocal harmonies. The Doobie Brothers were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004, and will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on May 2, 2020. The group has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide. Founding members John Hartman and Dave Shogren, Tiran Porter, Michael Hossack, Keith Knudsen and Jeff ""Skunk"" Baxter are former members of the band.

In this video the line up is: Tom Johnston (guitar, vocals), Patrick Simmons (guitar), John Hartman (drums), Tiran Porter (bass), Keith Knudsen (drums) and Jeff ‘Skunk’ Baxter (guitar)

The Doobie Brothers performed on the Warner Brothers Tour in Amsterdam (Jaap Edenhall) on 29 January 1975 and visited the Toppop studios to record this song.
This Toppop recording was first broadcast on 7 February 1975.

Lyrics:

I know just how to whisper,
and I know just how to cry;
I know just where to find the answers;
and I know just how to lie.
I know just how to fake it,
and I know just how to scheme;
I know just when to face the truth,
and then I know just when to dream.
And I know just where to touch you,
and I know just what to prove;
I know when to pull you closer,
and I know when to let you loose.
And I know the night is fading,
and I know that time's gonna fly;
and I'm never gonna tell you everything
I've got to tell you,
but I know I've got to give it a try.
And I know the roads to riches,
and I know the ways to fame;
I know all the rules
and then I know how to break 'em
and I always know the name of the game.",True,True,211508025.0,soft rock

Lyrics:
I realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice
And it don't count for much
But I'm not letting go
I believe there's still much to believe in
So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me
You know you can't fool me
I've been loving you too long
It started so easy
You want to carry on (carry on)
Lost in love and I don't know much
Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch?
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted
So lift your eyes if you feel you can (feel you can)
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan (show you a plan)
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me (oh, oh-oh)
You know you can't fool me
I've been loving you too long (I've been loving you too long)
It started so easy
You want to carry on (carry on)
Lost in love and I don't know much
Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch?
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted
You know you can't fool me
I've been loving you too long
It started so easy
You want to carry on (on, carry on)
Lost in love and I don't know much
Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch?
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted
Now I'm lost (lost in love and I don't know much)
Lost in love (was thinking aloud and fell out of touch)
Lost in love (but I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted)
Lost in love
Now I'm lost (lost in love and I don't know much)

No, no puedo olvidar esta tarde 
O tu cara mientras te ibas

Reflejan tu dolor

No, no puedo olvidar el mañana 
Cuando pienso en todas mis tristezas 
Cuando te tuve ahí 
Pero entonces te dejé ir 
Y ahora es justo 
Que yo te haga saber 
Lo que debes saber

Lyrics:

Here I am playing with those memories again
And just when I thought time had set me free
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me

Holding you, a feeling I never outgrew
Though each and every part of me has tried
Only you can fill that space inside

So there's no sense pretending
My heart it's not mending

Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby those memories come crashing through
And I just can't go on without",True,True,46419803.0,soft rock

Lyrics:

Now the night has gone
Now the night has gone away...
Doesn't seem that long
We hardly had two words to say...
Hold me in your arms
For just another day
I promise this one will go slow
Oh...
We have the right to know
We have the right to know

Don't say the mornings come
Don't say the mornings come so soon...
Must we end this way
When so much here is hard to lose...
Love is everywhere
I know it is
Such moments as this
Are too few
Oh...
It's all up to you
It's all up to you...
Here I am

Askin' for another day

Loves you in so many ways",True,True,45076682.0,soft rock

Memphis, Tennessee, I'm going to Graceland

And we are going to Graceland

He is the child of my first marriage

Lyrics:
The first thing I remember
I was lying in my bed
It couldn't of been no more
Than one or two

I remember there's a radio
Coming from the room next door
And my mother laughed
The way some ladies do

When it's late in the evening
And the music's seeping through",True,True,40408098.0,rock music

Lyrics:
Slip slidin’ away
Slip slidin’ away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you’re slip slidin’ away

I know a man
He came from my hometown
He wore his passion for his woman
Like a thorny crown
He said, “Delores, I live in fear
My love for you’s so overpowering
I’m afraid that I will disappear”",True,True,30138797.0,rock music

Lyrics:
You must understand though the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that 

Oh, oh, oh

What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason you do it for me
Oh, oh, oh

What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

Ooh

I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way
Oh, oh, oh

What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a sweet old fashioned notion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

Ooh got to do with it
(What's love but a second hand emotion)
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
(What's love) Oh oh (got to do with it)

Lyrics:
I call you, when I need you my heart′s on fire
You come to me, come to me, wild and wild
You come to me
Give me everything I need

Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams
Speak the language of love like you know what it means
And it can't be wrong, take my heart
And make it strong, baby

You′re simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met

I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart
Baby, I would rather be dead

In your heart I see the start of every night and every day
In your eyes, I get lost, I get washed away
Just as long as I'm here in your arms
I could be in no better place

You′re simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met

I′m stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh, tear us apart, no, no
Baby, I would rather be dead

Each time you leave me I start losing control
You're walking away with my heart and my soul
I can feel you even when I′m alone
Oh, baby, don't let go

Oh, you′re the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met

I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh, tear us apart, no, no
Baby, I would rather be dead

You′re the best
You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met

I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh, tear us apart, no, no
Baby, I would rather be dead

Lyrics:
You know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy
But there's just one thing
You see we never ever do nothing
Nice, easy
We always do it nice and rough
So we're gonna take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
But then we're gonna do the finish rough
This is the way we do ""Proud Mary""

And we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
Listen to the story

I left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
I was worrying 'bout the way the things might've been

You know that big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling, rolling yeah
Rolling on the river (the river)

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on a riverboat queen

You know that big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling, rolling yeah (rolling)
Rolling on the river
Say we're rolling (rolling) rolling yeah
Rolling on the river
The river

Oh I left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying about the way the things might've been

Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
Say we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river

Oh I cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
And I pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on a riverboat queen

Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, tell you rolling, we're rolling on the river
I tell you we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river

If you come down to the river
I bet you gonna find some people who live
And you don't have to worry if you got no money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, tell you rolling, we're rolling on the river
Tell you we have no time (rolling, rolling, rolling on the river)

(Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river)
Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river)
Tell you we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
I tell you we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river)

Lyrics:
Women of a certain age
They learn to rely and judge all his responses
Having played the mating game
She doesn't waste time 'cause all that she wants is

Really honest emotions
Ones he can't help but show
Though I hardly know your name
I know about love and I know

I don't wanna lose you
I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh, no
I just wanna hold on
To this true love, true love

Women who have made mistakes
Are a little afraid, they don't like taking chances
She will play the waiting game
She's never impressed by those manly advances

I know I've only just met you
Maybe I should know better
But when you look at me that way
There's something inside that's so right

I don't wanna lose you
And I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh, no
I just wanna hold on
To this true love, true love

I don't wanna lose you
And I always wanna feel this way, oh, yes
'Cause every time I'm with you
I feel true love, true love, true love

Tell me you're real
You're not pretending
Let's make a deal
'Cause my heart's depending on you, oh baby

I don't wanna lose you
I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh, no
I just wanna hold on
To this true love, true love

I don't wanna lose you
And I always wanna feel this way, oh, yeah
'Cause every time I'm with you
I feel true love, true love, true love

I don't wanna lose you
I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh, no
I just wanna hold on
To this true love, true love
I don't wanna lose you
And I always wanna feel this way
'Cause every time I'm with you
I feel true love, true love, true love

Let me say
Since, since we've been together
Uh, loving you forever is all I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Oh, baby, let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
It's alright with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
I want to spend my whole life with you
Let me say

Uh, loving you forever is all I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Oh, baby, let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

(Good or bad, happy or sad)

Why, oh, tell me, why do people break up
And turn around and make up?
I just came to see
You'd never do that to me, would you, baby?
Being around you is all I see

So, baby, let's we all stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
Let's (let's stay together) stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

Hello baby
Yes, it's your friendly phone fanatic again
Oh yeah I'm loaded
With verbal rap ability, baby
You know you inspire me to poetry
So listen while I recite naughty nothings
That'll wet your eardrums
I'd like to, I'd like to, I'd like to

When you got time to kill
And if I can't your love, then

I guess you'd call it obscene phone call
I'm not a storyteller though baby
I'd rather be with you, me to me
Oh, a sort of physical love, like, bubba
Oh, you're the sweetest fantasy I know
You
Excuse me if I seem obscene to you
I'm being real and that seems the thing to do
I'm just living and loving, waiting for the moment
When you got time to kill
And if I can't get your love, then
What's a telephone bill?
Oh baby, uh, just wanna hang on
I'd like to, I'd like to, I'd like to yeah, yeah, yeah
I'd like to make sweet love to you
Oh no, not that baby
I wanna be real with you
Let me just breathe in your ear hole baby

Let me see if I can hit that note again

Nobody to blame
I feel the same
To many days
Filled with rain
I can't take the pain
I must maintain
After all these years
Isn't it strange
That to remain sane
I've gotta make a change

If you're thinking
About moving away
And you
Can't come out to play
Don't you know
It's gonna hurt
So much inside
And all these feelings
You can't deny
And don't you know
That if you walk
Outside that door
Leaving me here
Howling for more
I guess
I'll have to follow you (follow you)
And I'll watch everything
That you do, baby

Gotta go, gotta go
Bout time (ooh ooh) bout time
Boy
I'm thinking about leaving you
Gotta go, gotta go
Hey
Gotta go, gotta go (ooh ooh)
Bout time (ooh ooh) bout time
Boy
I'm thinking about leaving you
Gotta go, gotta go
Hey
Gotta go, gotta go
Oh yeah

So I see you've gotta
Ticket all the way
Regardless of what I say
Don't you know
I can't hear none of that (mmm)
Yeah, maybe
I'm a little cracked (ooh)
Any if by chance we find love
As real as the sky above (yeah)
Gonna go all around the world
Cos I'm a part
Of everything you do baby
Baby I've got to go

Bout time (ooh ooh) bout time
Boy
I'm thinking about leaving you
Gotta go gotta go (ooh ooh)
Hey
Gotta go, gotta go (ooh ooh)
Bout time (ooh ooh) bout time
Boy
I'm thinking about leaving you
Gotta go, gotta go
Hey
Gotta go, gotta go

Baby I'm missing you
Yeah
My heart broke right in two (mmm)
The pain hurts slowly
You're my one and only (yeah)
Baby I wanna be kissing you
Smacking those lips
Until they fall in two (mmm)
I'm so lonely
Girl I wanna be kissing you

Gotta go, gotta go
Bout time (ooh ooh) bout time
Boy
I'm thinking about leaving you
Gotta go, gotta go (I love you)
Hey
Gotta go, gotta go(ooh)
Bout time, but I love you
Bout time, baby I love you
Gotta go, gotta go
Hey
Gotta go, gotta go (ooh)

Official Music Video for ""Worth My While""  from Bootsy Collins feat. Kali Uchis.  From the Bootsy Collins' album Worth My While, his first in 6 years.

LYRICS:

Bootsy had something to do with it?
He had everything to do with it and you'd be surprised. He had a lot to do with a whole lot of my friends falling in love and getting married
Why you say that?
Because we listened to his music all the time whenever we thought we was finna argue. Throw on a little Bootsy, you forget about all that
Oh
This is the school for fools in love
Did I mention? Pay attention
Another 40 days, 40 nights
I gotta get my love life right
I'd just like to say
Welcome to my Milkyway, baby
And you better believe there's a heartbreakin' every day
Oh, ain't nothin' wrong with having fun
Unless you ain't give none, baby
And that brings us to this occasion
True lover's dedication
Now, talk to me, baby
Can you make it worth my while?
Go on and show me, babe
Can you make it worth my while?
Uh, I certainly can
Yeah, I think that change is about to come, baby
Watch me, now
Come on, make it worth my while
It's been a long time
Go on and lead the way
But I think I'm ready, baby
Come on, make it worth my while
Just explain what you mean, baby
When I'm with him all I ever do
What you talkin' about?
Is reminisce over you
In funk we thrust, who else been on my bus?
I close my eyes, try to think it through
What you know, I'm stuck to you like glue
Oh, oh, oh
Now that's some unsportsmanlike conduct, babe
Can you make it worth my while?
Go on and show me, babe
Can you make it worth my while?
Uh, I certainly can
Yeah, I think that change is about to come, baby
Watch me, now
Come on, make it worth my while
It's been a long time
Go on and lead the way
But I think I'm ready, baby
Come on, make it worth my while
My dearly baby, I got something to say
What I'd like to say to you
Is, girl, you know that I love you too
And if you turn and walk away
Ah, I'm not even a dog, I'm just a stray, babe
But what I'd like to say would be
(And I didn't mean any harm)
I need your love and honesty
(And I didn't wanna do you no wrong)
I thought I made a little house a home
And now I'm so alone
Now, that's some unsportsmanlike conduct
Oh no, the trickle-down effect, baby
Sometimes the pain hurts more than it hurts you, baby girl
Now check this out, baby
What I'd like to do with you
Oh, any man, would wanna do
And that's hold you in my arms and let life live on
Let's hold you in my arms and let life live on
Listen while I recite oral history, baby
Can you make it worth my while?
Go on and show me, babe
Can you make it worth my while?
What you mean it's a dream
Come on, make it worth my while
This is Brother Nature calling
Go on and lead the way
Yeah
Come on, make it worth my while
From the west side of the wing of Heaven, baby
I'm virtually nothing
Yeah
And you're always a new adventure in my world, baby
He's the potter and I'm the clay
Wherever you look around, I'm on display
They call me Brother Nature
Like a book with no pages
I came from the west wing with nothing

Forever in blue jeans

Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight, by the fire
All alone you and I
Nothing around
But the sound of my heart
And your sighs

Money talks
But it can't sing and dance
And it can't walk
And long as I can have you
Here with me
I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans

And if you pardon me
I'd like to say
We'll do okay
Forever in blue jeans, babe
And long as I can have you
Here with me I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans, babe

""Forever in Blue Jeans"" is a song by Neil Diamond which was co-written with his guitarist Richard Bennett. This up-tempo track, released as a single by Columbia in February 1979, was taken from the previous year's Neil Diamond album You Don't Bring Me Flowers.

According to Cotton Incorporated ""Neil Diamond might have been right when he named his 1979 #1 hit ""Forever in Blue Jeans"": 81% of women are planning their next jeans purchase to be some shade of blue."" [1] The song, needless to say, has been used to promote the sale of blue jeans, most notably Will Ferrell, impersonating Neil Diamond singing, for The Gap.

You Don't Bring Me Flowers is an album by Neil Diamond released in 1978 to capitalize on the success of the title song, a duet with Barbra Streisand, which had originally appeared as a solo recording on Diamond's previous album, I'm Glad You're Here With Me Tonight.

This song is sad. It depicts being lonely and realizing that you are lonely or alone (emotionally). the saddest part is that he is talking to the chair saying I am.... I cried to the chair and the chair can not hear him (it has no ears). Making him even more alone. The chair is a reference to the psychiatrist's chair. Diamond battled with this song for 6 months following a near-breakdown after divorce and a move from NY to LA. His failure to land the part of Lenny Bruce in the movie Lenny left him close to breaking point and Diamond was depressed. Diamond eventually took a 4 year sabbatical from performing after his landmark appearance at the Greek Theater in LA in 1972.

I am I Said has a far deeper meaning than most casual listeners imagine. The song is a masterpiece by a great songwriter. By his own admission, Diamond spent months in psychotherapy and this song explains wonderfully his thoughts and feelings at the time. In Gestalt therapy, a patient projects his thoughts into an empty chair while a counsellor looks on making notes. This may well explain the meaning of the word chair. It is too easy to dismiss the 'chair' as a trite attempt to make a rhyme but Diamond is nothing but meticulous in his lyric writing and he has said that IAIS underwent countless rewrites until it said exactly what he wanted it to say. Diamond no doubt felt so alone and so alienated that he must have felt that no-one was listening to his tortured cries - not even the (psycho-analyst's) chair.. #NeilDiamond #PopRock

And make a song
You sing 'em out again
You sing 'em out again

You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When you come thru the door
At the end of the day

I remember when you couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after lovin' me late at night
When it's good for you, babe
And you're feelin' alright
Well you just roll over and turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore

It used to be so natural to talk about forever
But ""used to be's"" don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor
'Til we sweep them away

Baby, I remember
All the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry
Well, I leared how to love
And I learned how to lie
So you'd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye
You don't bring me flowers anymore

Bye, Bye...
Bye, Bye...
Oh, Oh..

I'm doin' this tonight,
You're probably gonna start a fight.
I know this can't be right.
Hey baby come on, 
I loved you endlessly,
When you weren't there for me.
So now it's time to leave and make it alone
I know that I can't take no more 
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye...

Bye Bye
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't nolie,
Baby, bye, bye, bye...
Bye Bye
Don't really wanna make it tough,
I just wanna tell you that I had enough.
It might sound crazy,
But it ain't no lie,
Baby, bye, bye, bye

And all that surround you,

Keeping your faith when it's gone

Was standing here all along..

And I will take
You in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
Till the day my life is through

Lyrics:

It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
with or without you 

(hey..yeah)
Baby I don't understand
Just why we can't be lovers
Things are getting out of hand
Trying too much, but baby we can't win 

Let it go
If you want me girl, let me know
I am down, on my knees
I can't take it anymore",True,True,172490384.0,Not Found
